Nos. 1371 of 2019*73 and 882 of 2021, decided on January 28, 2022
A. Constitution of India - Arts. 16(4), (4-A) and (4-B) and Art. 335 -
Reservation policy for SCs and STs - Identification of quantifiable data
showing inadequacy of representation of SCs and STs in public employment
- Discretion of executive to identify measure and quantify these yardsticks
under the enabling Arts. 16(4) and (4-A) and to lay down a valid, proper
and just reservation policy - Scope of - Limitations of judicial review -
Law clarified
- Held, Court cannot lay down such yardsticks or issue directions or advisory
sermons to the executive in respect of sphere which is exclusively within their
domain under the Constitution - Laying down criteria for determining the
inadequacy of representation would result in curtailing the discretion given to the
Central Government and State Governments - Supreme Court should leave "the
decision-making to the other branches of Government after directing their attention
to the problems rather than itself entering into the remedial field"
- The rationale why the enabling Arts. 16(4) and (4-A) give such discretion to
the executive is as follows - There are no fixed rules to identify, measure or
quantify the numerous factors like backwardness of class, inadequacy of
representation, equality, justice or efficiency of administration, etc. - Each of these
competing claims seeks to achieve certain goals - How best one should optimise
these conflicting claims can only be done by the administration in the context of
local prevailing conditions in public employment - It depends upon facts and
circumstances of each case - Hence, the Court refused to lay down any criteria for
determining the adequacy of representation, as the States were at liberty to
determine the factors relevant for deciding adequate representation - Reservation,
Concession, Exemption, Relaxation and Affirmative Action Reservation
Policy/Adequacy of Reservation/Quantifiable data
(Paras 12 to 17)
B. Constitution of India - Arts. 16(4), (4-A) and (4-B) and Art. 335 -
Reservation policy - Reservation policy for SCs and STs - Collection and
application of quantifiable data showing inadequacy of representation of SCs
and STs in public employment - Basic unit from which such data should be
collected and applied, clarified
- Collection of quantifiable data regarding inadequacy of representation
of SCs and STs, held, cannot be with reference to the entire service or
"class" ""group" but it should be relatable to the cadre/grade/category of
posts concerned
- Cadre, which should be the unit for the purpose of collection of quantifiable
data in relation to the promotional post(s), would be meaningless if data pertaining
to representation of SCs and STs is with reference to the entire service - The
entire service cannot be considered to be a cadre for the purpose of promotion
from one post to a higher post in a different grade - Promotion is made from one
grade to the next higher grade, in relation to which cadres are constituted - As per
Office Memorandum dt. 2-7-1997, a cadre is to be construed as the number of
posts in a particular grade - The percentage of reservation in promotions has to be
applied to the entire cadre strength
collection of data on the basis of "groups" and not cadres is contrary to the law laid
(Paras 18 to 38 and 64 to 69)
C. Constitution of India - Arts. 16(4), (4-A) and (4-B) and Art. 335 -
Reservation policy - Reservation policy for SCs and STs - Test for
determining adequacy of representation - Whether proportion of the
population of SCs and STs to the population of India should be taken to be
the test for such determination
- Held, there is no need to express any opinion on this aspect - The exercise
of collecting quantifiable data depends on numerous factors, with conflicting claims
to be optimised by the administration in the context of local prevailing conditions in
public employment - As equity, justice and efficiency are variable factors and are
context-specific, how these factors should be identified and counter-balanced will
depend on the facts and circumstances of each case - It is for the State to assess
the inadequacy of representation of SCs and STs in promotional posts, by taking
into account relevant factors
(Paras 40 and 41)
D. Constitution of India - Arts. 16(4), (4-A) and (4-B) and Art. 335 -
Reservation policy - Reservation policy for SCs and STs - Discontinuation
of reservation in totality - Limitations of judicial review - Held, the Court is
not inclined to express any view on discontinuation of reservations in
totality, which is completely within the domain of the legislature and the
executive
(Paras 42 and 43)
E. Constitution of India - Arts. 16(4), (4-A) and (4-B) and Art. 335 -
Reservation policy - Reservation policy for SCs and STs - Periodical review
of data collected to determine inadequacy of representation for the purpose
of providing reservation - Limitations of judicial review - Held, the period
for review should be reasonable and is left to the Government to determine
(Paras 42 and 43)
F. Constitution of India - Arts. 16(4), (4-A) & (4-B), Art. 335 and Art.
shall operate prospectively from its date of decision
- Held, in exercise of power to do complete justice under Art. 142, said
valid ruling in M. Nagaraj that identification of quantifiable data showing
inadequacy of representation of SCs and STs in public employment is a
necessary pre-condition for grant of reservation in promotion for SCs and
STs, is to be applied prospectively even though M. Nagaraj itself did not
declare that it would have prospective operation
- Held, the rationale why M. Nagaraj case would have prospective effect is only
to avoid chaos and confusion that would ensue from its retrospective operation, as
it would have a debilitating effect on a very large number of employees, who may
have availed of reservation in promotions without there being strict compliance of
the conditions prescribed in M. Nagaraj case - Most of them would have already
retired from service on attaining the age of superannuation - The judgment of M.
Nagaraj case was delivered in 2006, interpreting Art. 16(4-A) of the Constitution
which came into force in 1995 - As making the principles laid down in M. Nagaraj
The surest way't to legal research!"
case effective from the year 1995 would be detrimental to the interests of a
number of civil servants and would have an effect of unsettling the seniority of
individuals over a long period of time, it is necessary that the judgment of M.
Nagaraj case should be declared to have prospective effect from its date of decision
(Paras 46 to 61)
G. Constitution of India - Arts. 16(4), (4-A) and (4-B) and Art. 335 -
Reservation policy - Reservation policy for SCs and STs - Collection of
quantifiable data showing inadequacy of representation of SCs and STs in
public employment - Sampling method of collecting quantifiable data -
Whether valid
- Held, sampling method which was adopted by the Ratna Prabha Committee
might be a statistical formula appropriate for collection of data - However, for the
purpose of collection of quantifiable data to assess representation of SCs and STs
for the purpose of providing reservation in promotions, cadre, which is a part of a
"group", is the unit and the data has to be collected with respect to each cadre -
approving the collection of data on the basis of "groups" and not cadres is contrary
(Paras 64 to 69)
H. Constitution of India - Arts. 141 and 142 - Prospective application of
decision or prospective overruling of earlier position of law - Availability of
power - Held, there cannot be any manner of doubt that the Supreme
Court can apply its decision prospectively or prospectively overrule earlier
position of law i.e. from the date of its judgment to save past transactions
I. Constitution of India - Arts. 141 and 142 - Prior judgment of
Supreme Court, held, can be made prospectively applicable subsequently by
a different, even smaller Bench of Supreme Court, in exercise of the power
to complete justice under Art. 142 - It is not the law that prospective
overruling or prospective operation can be directed only by the Court/Bench
which has rendered the decision in question - Hence, in exercise of power
under Art. 142 to do complete justice, present three-Judge Bench declared
five-Judge Constitution Bench in M. Nagaraj to have prospective operation
- See also Shortnote F
J. Constitution of India - Art. 141 - Obiter dictum - What is - Ratio
decidendi alone is binding - Reiterated
- A decision on a point not necessary for the purpose of or which does not fall
for determination in that decision becomes an obiter dictum - It is well-settled that
only the ratio decidendi can act as the binding or authoritative precedent - Reliance
placed on mere general observations or casual expressions of the Court, is not of
much avail
The following issues arose for consideration before the Supreme Court:
212, one would arrive at quantifiable data showing the inadequacy of
representation of SCs and STs in public employment?
(2) What is the unit with respect to which quantifiable data showing the
inadequacy of representation is required to be collected?
(3) Whether the proportion of the population of SCs and STs to the
population of India should be taken to be the test for determining the adequacy
of representation in promotional posts for the purposes of Article 16(4-A)?
(4) Should there be a time period for reviewing the inadequacy of
representation?
(5) Whether the judgment in M. Nagaraj case can be said to operate
prospectively?
(6) Whether quantifiable data showing the inadequacy of representation can
be collected on the basis of sampling methods, as held by the Court in B.K.
Pavitra case ["B.K. Pavitra (2) case"]?
Without expressing any opinion on the merits of individual appeals, the Supreme
Court
Held :
The yardstick for arriving at quantifiable data
Articles 16(4) and 16(4-A) are enabling provisions. The discretion of the State
to provide reservation is subject to the existence of backwardness and inadequacy
of representation in public employment. Backwardness has to be based on
objective factors whereas inadequacy has to factually exist. There is no fixed
yardstick to identify equality, justice and efficiency which are variable factors and it
depends on the facts and circumstances of each case. The concepts of efficiency,
backwardness, and inadequacy of representation are required to be identified and
measured on the basis of data. In case of a challenge made to reservations
provided by the State Government, it is incumbent on the State Government to
satisfy the Court that the decision is supported by quantifiable data showing the
backwardness of the class and inadequacy of representation of that class in public
employment, in addition to compliance with Article 335 of the Constitution.
(Para 12)
relied on
The exercise of identifying and measuring concepts of efficiency, backwardness
and inadequacy of representation on the basis of data depends on numerous
factors. It is for this reason that the enabling provisions are required to be made
because each competing claim seeks to achieve certain goals. How best one should
optimise these conflicting claims can only be done by the administration in the
context of local prevailing conditions in public employment.
(Para 13)
289, affirmed
The Court refused to lay down any criteria for determining the adequacy of
representation, as the States were given the liberty to determine the factors
relevant for deciding adequate representation, depending upon the promotional
posts in question.
(Para 14)
86, considered
referred to
It is neither legal nor proper for the Courts to issue directions or advisory
sermons to the executive in respect of the sphere which is exclusively within their
domain under the Constitution.
(Para 15)
affirmed
The Supreme Court should leave "the decision-making to the other branches of
Government after directing their attention to the problems rather than itself
entering into the remedial field".
(Para 16)
830, relied on
Determination of inadequate representation of SCs and STs in services under a
State is left to the discretion of the State, as the determination depends upon
myriad factors which cannot be envisaged herein. A conscious decision was taken
by the Supreme Court to leave it to the States to fix the criteria for determining
inadequacy of representation. The submission that the Supreme Court has to lay
down the yardstick for measuring the adequacy of representation did not yield a
favourable result as it is befitting for the States to have the liberty to evaluate the
representation of SCs and STs in public employment. Laying down criteria for
determining the inadequacy of representation would result in curtailing the discretion
given to the State Governments. In addition, the prevailing local conditions, which
may require to be factored in, might not be uniform. Moreover, the validity of law
made by the State Governments providing reservation in promotions shall be
decided on a case-to-case basis for the purpose of establishing whether the
inadequacy of representation is supported by quantifiable data. Therefore, no
yardstick can be laid down by the Supreme Court for determining the adequacy of
representation of SCs and STs in promotional posts for the purpose of providing
reservation.
(Para 17)
(L&S) 86, followed
Unit for collecting quantifiable data
The civil posts under the Government are organised into different services. A
service constitutes "classes"/"groups" of posts. A "class"/""group" is further
bifurcated into grades. Though the nomenclature might be different, the structure of
services under the Union and the States is similar. According to the instructions
issued by the Union of India, cadres are constituted for each grade. The Union of
India submitted that there are 3800 cadres in 44 Ministries/Departments.
Fundamental Rule 9(4) defines "cadre" to mean the strength of a service or part of
a service sanctioned as a separate unit. It is the choice of a State to constitute
cadres. The entire service cannot be considered to be a cadre for the purpose of
promotion from one post to a higher post in a different grade. Promotion is made
from one grade to the next higher grade, in relation to which cadres are
constituted. The post of Director and Deputy Director cannot form one cadre. A
cadre is constituted by the Government by taking into account several factors
within its sole discretion.
(Paras 18 to 37)
relied on
affirmed
impliedly distinguished
In the Office Memorandum dated 2-7-1997, the Union of India set out the
principles for making and operating post-based rosters, in which it has been
expressly stated that cadre is to be construed as the number of posts in a particular
grade. It is made clear that rosters have been prepared grade-wise which are
reviewed on a yearly basis and that reservation in promotions is implemented on
the basis of these rosters, which operate grade-wise. The percentage of
reservation in promotions has to be applied to the entire cadre strength. The unit
for the operation of the roster would be the cadre strength.
(Para 38)
Before providing for reservation in promotions to a cadre, the State is obligated
to collect quantifiable data regarding the inadequacy of representation of SCs and
STs. The collection of information regarding the inadequacy of representation of
SCs and STs cannot be with reference to the entire service or class"/"`group" but
it
should be relatable to the grade/category of posts to which promotion is sought.
Cadre, which should be the unit for the purpose of collection of quantifiable data in
relation to the promotional post(s), would be meaningless if data pertaining to the
representation of SCs and STs is with reference to the entire service.
(Para 38)
on
Prospective operation of the judgment in M. Nagaraj case
The law declared by the Supreme Court interpreting Article 16(4-A) in M.
Nagaraj case, as it currently stands, applies from 17-6-1995 i.e. the date on which
Article 16(4-A) came into force.
(Para 47)
(L&S) 86, referred to
Regarding the scope of Article 142 of the Constitution, the law declared by the
Supreme Court is the law of the land and in so declaring, the operation of the law
can be restricted to the future, thereby saving past transactions.
(Para 48)
Golak Nath V. State of Punjab, (1967) 2 SCR 762 : AIR 1967 SC 1643; Indra
relied on
The power of the Supreme Court under Article 142 of the Constitution is a
constituent power transcendental to statutory prohibition. Relief can be granted,
moulded or restricted in a manner most appropriate to the situation before it in
such a way as to advance the interests of justice. The doctrine of prospective
overruling is in essence a recognition of the principle that the Court moulds the
reliefs claimed to meet the justice of the case.
(Para 49)
There cannot be any manner of doubt that the Supreme Court can apply its
decision prospectively i.e. from the date of its judgment to save past transactions.
(Para 49)
Prospective overruling can not only be on an earlier judicial decision on the same
issue which was otherwise final, the Court also has the power even when deciding
on an issue for the first time. There is no prohibition for the Court to postpone the
operation of an earlier judgment or to prospectively overrule it.
(Paras 49 to 56)
It is no doubt true that M. Nagaraj case did not state that it would be
prospective in operation. It has been held in judgments of the Supreme Court that a
prior judgment of the Supreme Court can be made prospectively applicable
subsequently by a different Bench of Supreme Court in exercise of the power to
complete justice under Article 142 of the Constitution. It is not the law that
prospective overruling or prospective operation can be done only by the Court
which has rendered the decision.
(Paras 50 to 61)
Golak Nath V. State of Punjab, (1967) 2 SCR 762 : AIR 1967 SC 1643; Ashok
(L&S) Supp 1, relied on
The Supreme Court in Golak Nath, (1967) 2 SCR 762 and Ashok Kumar Gupta,
mould the relief to do complete justice. To conclude this point, the purpose of
holding that M. Nagaraj case would have a prospective effect is only to avoid chaos
and confusion that would ensue from its retrospective operation, as it would have a
debilitating effect on a very large number of employees, who may have availed of
reservation in promotions without there being strict compliance of the conditions
prescribed in M. Nagaraj case. Most of them would have already retired from
service on attaining the age of superannuation. The judgment of M. Nagaraj case
was delivered in 2006, interpreting Article 16(4-A) of the Constitution which came
into force in 1995. As making the principles laid down in M. Nagarai case effective
from the year 1995 would be detrimental to the interests of a number of civil
servants and would have an effect of unsettling the seniority of individuals over a
long period of time, it is necessary that the judgment of M. Nagaraj case should be
declared to have prospective effect.
(Para 62)
to have prospective effect
A decision on a point not necessary for the purpose of or which does not fall for
determination in that decision becomes an obiter dictum. It is a well-settled
proposition that only the ratio decidendi can act as the binding or authoritative
precedent. Reliance placed on mere general observations or casual expressions of
the Court, is not of much avail.
(Paras 60 and 61)
Golak Nath V. State of Punjab, (1967) 2 SCR 762 : AIR 1967 SC 1643; Ashok
held obiter and per incuriam on this point
The State should justify reservation in promotions with respect to the cadre to
which promotion is made. Taking into account the data pertaining to a "group",
which would be an amalgamation of certain cadres in a service, would not give the
correct picture of the inadequacy of representation of SCs and STs in the cadre in
relation to which reservation in promotions is sought to be made. Rosters are
prepared cadre-wise and not group-wise. The sampling method which was adopted
by the Ratna Prabha Committee might be a statistical formula appropriate for the
collection of data. However, for the purpose of collection of quantifiable data to
assess the representation of SCs and STs for the purpose of providing reservation
in promotions, cadre, which is a part of a "group", is the unit and the data has to be
collected with respect to each cadre. Therefore, the conclusion in B.K. Pavitra (2)
case approving the collection of data on the basis of "groups" and not cadres is
contrary to the law laid down in M. Nagaraj case and Jarnail Singh case.
(Paras 64 to 69)
(L&S) 86, relied on
The surest way't to legal research!"
It is made clear that the Court has not expressed any opinion on the merits of
any individual case as the Court has only answered the common issues that were
formulated after hearing the parties.

The Judgment of the Court was delivered by
L. NAGESWARA RAO, J. Leave granted. Reservation of 27% in
favour of Backward Classes was the subject-matter of dispute in Indra
Sawhney V. Union of India¹. This Court was of the opinion that Article
16(4) of the Constitution of India does not provide for reservation in
the matter of promotions. It was clarified that the judgment shall have
prospective operation and shall not affect the promotions already made,
whether made on regular or on any other basis. Reservation provided in
the matter of promotions in the Central services or State services was
directed to be continued for a period of five years from the date of the
judgment.
2. By the Constitution (Seventy-seventh Amendment) Act, 1995,
which came into force on 17-6-1995, Article 16 of the Constitution was
amended by insertion of Article 16(4-A), which then read as below:
"16. (4-A) Nothing in this article shall prevent the State from
making any provision for reservation in matters of promotion to any
class or classes of posts in the services under the State in favour of
the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes which, in the opinion
of the State, are not adequately represented in the services under
the State."
3. The above amendment was made in view of the State's opinion
that representation of the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes
("SCs" and "STs") in services in the States had not reached the
required level and that it was necessary to continue the existing
dispensation by providing reservation in promotions. Therefore, the
Government decided to continue the existing policy of reservation in
promotions for the SCs and the STs, according to the Statement of
Objects and Reasons of the Constitution (Seventy-seventh
Amendment) Act, 1995.
4. In Union of India V. Virpal Singh Chauhan², this Court held that
roster-point promotees who were given the benefit of accelerated
promotion would not get consequential seniority. As the Government
was of the opinion that the concept of "catch-up" rule was not in the
interest of SCs and STs in the matter of seniority on promotion, Article
16(4-A) was further amended by the Constitution (Eighty-fifth
Amendment) Act, 2001 to give the benefit of consequential seniority in
addition to accelerated promotion. At present, Article 16(4-A) reads as
follows:
"16. (4-A) Nothing in this article shall prevent the State from
making any provision for reservation in matters of promotion, with
consequential seniority, to any class or classes of posts in the
services under the State in favour of the
Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes which, in the opinion of the
State, are not adequately represented in the services under the State."
5. A number of vacancies which were reserved for SCs and STs could
not be filled up due to non-availability of candidates belonging to these
categories. Such of these vacancies which were not filled up were
treated as "backlog vacancies" and were carried forward. In Indra
Sawhney1, this Court held that reservations contemplated in a year
under Article 16(4) shall not exceed 50%. In practice, backlog
vacancies were not included within the ceiling of 50% reservation in a
year. An office memorandum was issued on 29-8-1997 making the
50% limit applicable to current as well as backlog vacancies, in
accordance with Indra Sawhney1. Thereafter, several representations
were made to the Central Government about the injustice that would be
caused to the members of SCs and STs in view of the office
memorandum dated 29-8-1997, which led to a further amendment to
Article 16 of the Constitution of India, by insertion of Article 16(4-B) by
the Constitution (Eighty-first Amendment) Act, 2000.
6. Article 16(4-B) reads as under:
"16. (4-B) Nothing in this article shall prevent the State from
considering any unfilled vacancies of a year which are reserved for
being filled up in that year in accordance with any provision for
reservation made under clause (4) or clause (4-A) as a separate
class of vacancies to be filled up in any succeeding year or years and
such class of vacancies shall not be considered together with the
vacancies of the year in which they are being filled up for
determining the ceiling of fifty per cent reservation on total number
of vacancies of that year."
7. The validity of the above amendments made to Article 16(4) was
considered by this Court in M. Nagaraj V. Union of India ³. The key issue
that was identified and decided in M. Nagaraj3 is whether any
constitutional limitation mentioned in Article 16(4) and Article 335
stood obliterated by the constitutional amendments resulting in Articles
16(4-A) and 16(4-B). This Court upheld the constitutional
amendments. The amendments were held to be enabling provisions.
This Court observed that the State is not bound to make reservation for
SCs and STs in matters of promotion. However, if it wishes to exercise
its discretion, the State has to collect quantifiable data showing the
backwardness of the class and inadequacy of representation of that
class in public employment, in addition to compliance with Article 335
of the Constitution of India.
8. This Court in State of Tripura V. Jayanta Chakraborty referred M.
Nagaraj3 to a larger Bench for reconsideration. Further, in State of
Maharashtra V. Vijay Ghogre5, this Court thought it appropriate that the
request for reconsideration of the judgment in M. Nagaraj3 should be
heard by a Constitution Bench. The request made for referring M.
Nagaraj to a seven-Judge Bench was not entertained by this Court in
Jarnail Singh V. Lachhmi Narain Gupta- However, the conclusion
arrived at in M. Nagaraj³ relating
to collection of quantifiable data showing backwardness of the SCs and
the STs was held to be invalid as the same was contrary to a larger
Bench judgment of this Court in Indra Sawhney1, wherein it had been
held by the Court that conditions of social and educational
backwardness are presumed to be satisfied in case of SCs and STs as
they are identified and grouped as such because of prior discrimination
and its continuing ill effects. The Court rejected the remaining grounds
of challenge to the decision in M. Nagaraj³ 3 and reiterated that the State
has to collect quantifiable data regarding inadequate representation of
SCs and STs in the services of the State, if reservation is sought to be
provided in promotions.
9. In the meanwhile, some High Courts have dealt with matters
where reservation in promotions provided by the Central Government
The surest way legal research!
and the State Governments to SCs and STs have been assailed as being
violative of the law laid down by this Court in M. Nagaraj³.
The
judgments Z, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27,
28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37,
38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63,
64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72 of the High Courts have been challenged
before this Court. In view of the broad similarities in the issues
involved, all the cases were tagged together. On 18-1-2021 73
a
direction was given to the Advocates-on-Record appearing for each
State to submit a note to the learned Attorney General for India,
identifying the issues involved in their respective cases. The learned
Attorney General for India was requested to hold a conference with the
counsel appearing in the matters to finalise the issues for determination
and a list of issues with reference to each State was directed to be
prepared thereafter. A note was submitted by the learned Attorney
General formulating issues that arise for our consideration.
10. When the matter was listed for hearing on 14-9-2021, it was
made clear that this Court would not entertain any arguments for
reconsideration of the
law laid down by this Court in M. Nagaraj3 as a Constitution Bench in
Jarnail Singh had rejected such a request. This Court was informed
that the cases in this batch of matters can be bifurcated into eleven
categories. As the common issues that have been raised could be
decided without reference to the facts of each case, the learned counsel
appearing for the parties were requested to make submissions on the
issues that had been identified by the learned Attorney General.
11. After considering the issues identified by the learned Attorney
General and other learned counsel and hearing them, the following six
points are formulated for determination:
11.1. (1) What is the yardstick by which, according to M. Nagaraj³,
one would arrive at quantifiable data showing inadequacy of
representation of SCs and STs in public employment?
11.2. (2) What is the unit with respect to which quantifiable data
showing inadequacy of representation is required to be collected?
11.3. (3) Whether proportion of the population of SCs and STs to the
population of India should be taken to be the test for determining
adequacy of representation in promotional posts for the purposes of
Article 16(4-A)?
11.4. (4) Should there be a time period for reviewing inadequacy of
representation?
11.5. (5) Whether the judgment in M. Nagaraj3 can be said to
operate prospectively?
11.6. (6) Whether quantifiable data showing inadequacy of
representation can be collected on the basis of sampling methods, as
held by this Court in B.K. Pavitra V. Union of India 75 ["B.K. Pavitra
(2)"]?
(1) Yardstick for arriving at quantifiable data
12. Articles 16(4) and 16(4-A) are enabling provisions. It was held
in M. Nagaraj3 that the discretion of the State to provide reservation is
subject to the existence of backwardness and inadequacy of
representation in public employment. It was further held that
backwardness has to be based on objective factors whereas inadequacy
has to factually exist. There is no fixed yardstick to identify equality,
justice and efficiency which are variable factors and it depends on the
facts and circumstances of each case. This Court was of the further
opinion that the concepts of efficiency, backwardness, inadequacy of
representation are required to be identified and measured on the basis
of data. In case of a challenge made to reservations provided by the
State Government, it is incumbent on the State Government to satisfy
the Court that the decision is supported by quantifiable data showing
backwardness of the class and inadequacy of representation of that
class in public employment, in addition to compliance with Article 335
of the Constitution of India.
13. The exercise of identifying and measuring concepts of efficiency,
backwardness and inadequacy of representation on the basis of data
depends on numerous factors. It is for this reason that the enabling
provisions are required to be made because each competing claim
seeks to achieve certain goals. How best one should optimise these
conflicting claims can only be done by the administration in the context
of local prevailing conditions in public employment. 76
14. The learned Attorney General argued before this Court in Jarnail
Singh5 that this Court did not indicate any test for determining
adequacy of representation in service in M. Nagaraj³. He submitted that
it is important to decide the yardstick applicable for arriving at
quantifiable data showing inadequacy of representation of SCs and STs
to avoid multiple litigation. This Court refused to lay down any criteria
for determining the adequacy of representation, as the States were
given liberty to determine the factors relevant for deciding adequate
representation, depending upon the promotional posts in question.
15. It is well-established that it is neither legal nor proper for the
courts to issue directions or advisory sermons to the executive in
respect of the sphere which is exclusively within their domain under the
Constitution In Asif Hameed V. State of J&K78 this Court observed as
"19. When a State action is challenged, the function of the court
is to examine the action in accordance with law and to determine
whether the legislature or the executive has acted within the powers
and functions assigned under the Constitution and if not, the court
must strike down the action. While doing so the court must remain
within its self-imposed limits. The court sits in judgment on the
action of a coordinate branch of the Government. While exercising
power of judicial review of administrative action, the court is not an
appellate authority. The Constitution does not permit the court to
direct or advise the executive in matters of policy or to sermonise
qua any matter which under the Constitution lies within the sphere
of legislature or executive,... "
16. In P. Ramachandra Rao V. State of Karnataka 79, , R.C. Lahoti, J.
referred to a monograph "Judicial Activism and Constitutional
Democracy in India" by T.R. Andhyarujina, in his judgment. While
lauding judicial activism, a note of caution was sounded in the said
monograph to the effect that the Supreme Court should leave "the
decision-making to the other branches of Government after directing
their attention to the problems rather than itself entering into the
remedial field". The following sentences from the monograph are very
well
p. 600, para 24)
"24.
\
courts lack the facilities to gather detailed data or to
make probing enquiries. Reliance on advocates who appear before
them for data is likely to give them partisan or inadequate
information. On the other hand if courts have to rely on their own
knowledge or research it is bound to be selective and subjective.
Moreover, since courts mandate for isolated cases, their decrees
make no allowance for the differing and varying situations which
administrators will encounter in applying the mandates to other
cases.
17. Determination of inadequate representation of SCs and STs in
services under a State is left to the discretion of the State, as the
determination depends upon myriad factors which this Court cannot
envisage. A conscious decision was taken by this Court in M. Nagaraj3
and Jarnail Singh6 to leave it to the States to fix the criteria for
determining inadequacy of representation. The submission of the
learned Attorney General for India that this Court has to lay down the
yardstick for measuring adequacy of representation did not yield a
favourable result as this Court in Jarnail Singh 6 found it befitting for the
States to have the liberty to evaluate the representation of SCs and STs
in public employment. Laying down of criteria for determining the
inadequacy of representation would result in curtailing the discretion
given to the State Governments. In addition, the prevailing local
conditions, which may require to be factored in, might not be uniform.
Moreover, in M. Nagaraj³, this Court made it clear that the validity of
law made by the State Governments providing reservation in
promotions shall be decided on a case-to-case basis for the purpose of
establishing whether the inadequacy of representation is supported by
quantifiable data. Therefore, we are of the opinion that no yardstick can
be laid down by this Court for determining the adequacy of
representation of SCs and STs in promotional posts for the purpose of
providing reservation.
(2) Unit for collecting quantifiable data
18. Seniority of Superintending Engineers in the Irrigation
Department of the State of Punjab was the subject-matter of a writ
petition filed under Article 32 of the Constitution of India in R.K.
Sabharwal V. State of Punjab80. The relevant instructions issued by the
State of Punjab provided for 14% reservation for SCs. Two points came
up for consideration before this Court in the said judgment, the first
being that in case more than 14% of the Scheduled Caste candidates
are appointed/promoted in a cadre on their own merit/seniority, then
the purpose of reservation having been achieved in the said cadre, the
government instructions providing reservations would become
inoperative. The second point on which arguments were heard is that
roster cannot operate once
the posts earmarked for the SCs, STs and Backward Classes are filled.
Any post falling vacant in a cadre, thereafter, is to be filled from the
category-reserved or general-due to retirement, etc. of whose
member the post fell vacant.
19. The first point raised by general category candidates was
rejected by this Court by holding that reserved category candidates can
compete for non-reserved posts and in the event of their appointment
to the said posts, their number cannot be added and taken into
consideration for working out the percentage of reservation. This Court
was of the opinion that Article 16(4) of the Constitution of India
enables the State Government to make provision for reservation in
favour of any Backward Class of citizens which, in the opinion of the
State is not adequately represented in the services. The percentage of
posts reserved for Backward Classes, as prescribed by the State, has to
be strictly followed and cannot be varied or changed simply because
some members of the Backward Class have already been
appointed/promoted against the general seats.
20. The second point relates to the implementation of the roster in
the form of "running account" year to year. Roster points were fixed in
a lot of 100 posts. This Court held that once 14% posts earmarked in
the roster are filled up, the result envisaged by the instructions is
achieved. Thereafter, there is no justification for operating the roster.
This Court observed that the "running account" is to operate only till
the quota provided by the instructions is reached and not thereafter.
The vacancies arising in the cadre, after the initial posts are filled, will
have to be filled from amongst the category to which the post belonged
in the roster.
21. In M. Nagaraj³, this Court observed that the appropriate
Government has to apply cadre strength as a unit in the operation of
the roster in order to ascertain whether a given class/group is
adequately represented in the service. Cadre strength as a unit also
ensures that the upper ceiling limit of 50% is not violated. Following
the law laid down in R.K. Sabharwal80, this Court in M. Nagaraj 3 further
held that the roster has to be post-specific and not vacancy based.
22. In M. Nagaraj³, this Court held that it is open to the State to
provide for reservation in promotions subject to limitation that there
must exist compelling reasons for backwardness, inadequacy of
representation in a class of post(s) keeping in mind the overall
administrative efficiency. While referring to the roster, this Court
observed that the appropriate Government has to apply the cadre
strength as a unit in the operation of the roster in order to ascertain
whether a given class/group is adequately represented in the service.
Collection of quantifiable data regarding inadequacy of representation
as stipulated by M. Nagaraj3 is relatable to the cadre concerned,
according to Jarnail Singh6.
23. While it is clear that the unit for collection of quantifiable data is
with respect to a cadre, it is necessary to understand what cadre
means. For a better appreciation, it would be profitable to relate to the
historical background of the rules concerned applicable to services
under the Centre as well as the States. In exercise of the powers
conferred by sub-section (2) of Section 96-B of the Government of
India Act, 1919, the Secretary of State in Council made the Civil
Services (Classification, Control and Appeal) Rules, 1930. Public
services in India were classified as per Rule 14 of the said Rules in the
following manner : (i) the all India Services; (ii) the Central Services,
Class-I; (iii) the Central Services, Class-II; (iv) the Provincial Services;
(v) the Specialist Services; and (vi) the Subordinate Services.
24. The First Central Pay Commission considered the classification of
services to "secure fair treatment to the employees on the basis of their
services to Government, fair return to the Government for the salary
paid to its employees, and relative fairness to employees in different
kinds of position on the basis of the nature of the duties performed".
According to the Report of the First Central Pay Commission, the
Central Services were broadly divided into four categories i.e. Class I,
Class II, Subordinate Services and Inferior Services. After taking note
of some objections regarding the use of the words "subordinate" and
"inferior" as being derogatory, the First Central Pay Commission
recommended that those categories be referred to as Class III and
Class IV.
25. The classification of the Civil Services of the Union of India as
per the Central Civil Services (Classification, Control and Appeal) Rules,
1965 ("the CCA Rules, 1965") is : (1) Central Civil Services, Class I;
(2) Central Civil Services, Class II; (3) Central Civil Services, Class III;
and (4) Central Civil Services, Class IV. Rule 4 of the said Rules
provides that a particular class can comprise of different grades. All civil
posts under the Union were reclassified from "Class" to "Group" by way
of the Notification of the Government of India in the Department of
Personnel and Administrative Reforms number S.O. 5041 dated 11-11-
1975 and as recorded in Rule 6-A of the CCA Rules, 1965. Thereafter,
the Central Civil Services/the Central Civil Posts were organised into
Group 'A', Group 'B', Group 'C' and Group 'D'. The present structure of
the Central Civil Services is that a particular Service is divided across
Groups, which further consist of grades.
26. During the course of the hearing, the Union of India has filed an
affidavit informing this Court of the compliance of the conditions
prescribed in M. Nagaraj3 before making reservation in promotions in
services under the Centre. The Union of India referred to an Office
Memorandum dated 2-7-1997, which heavily relied on R.K.
Sabharwal wherein this Court had held that the cadre-strength is
always measured by the number of posts comprising the cadre. Right
to be considered for appointment can only be claimed in respect of a
post in a cadre. As a consequence, the percentage of reservation has to
be worked out in relation to the number of posts which form the cadre-
strength. The Union of India has brought to the notice of this Court that
there are around
90 Ministries/Departments under the Government of India in which 30
lakh employees are working. Referring to information received from 44
Ministries/Departments out of the 90, the Union of India has stated that
there are around 3800 cadres. We were also apprised of the fact that
instructions have been in existence since 2013 for appointment of an
officer of the rank of Deputy Secretary to the Government of India as a
Liaison Officer, who is responsible for ensuring compliance of the
instructions on reservation.
27. According to the affidavit filed by the Union of India, thousands
of reservation rosters are being maintained in the various
offices/units/sub-units of the Departments and Ministries in the
Government of India. Office Memorandum dated 2-7-1997 issued by
the Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions, Department
of Personnel and Training, Government of India contains principles for
preparing the rosters. According to Para 4(c) of the said office
memorandum, "cadre", for the purpose of a roster, shall mean a
particular grade and shall comprise the number of posts to be filled by
a particular mode of recruitment in terms of the applicable recruitment
rules. Explanatory Notes which are appended to the Office
Memorandum dated 2-7-1997 elaborate the principles for making and
operating post-based rosters.
28. Para 5 of the Explanatory Notes reads as follows:
"While cadre is generally to be construed as the number of posts
in a particular grade, for the purpose of preparation of roster, it shall
comprise posts required to be filled by a particular mode of
recruitment in terms of the applicable recruitment rules. To
illustrate, in a cadre comprising 200 posts, where the recruitment
rules prescribe a ratio of 50 : 50 for direct recruitment and
promotions, the roster for direct recruitment shall have 100 points
and that for promotion shall have 100 points - thus making a total
of 200."
29. The Union of India has filed the prevalent service rules of the
States of Andhra Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, Rajasthan,
Madhya Pradesh, Punjab and Himachal Pradesh for the purpose of
demonstrating the implementation of reservation in promotions in
services under these States. Rule 2(8) of the Andhra Pradesh State and
Subordinate Services Rules, 1996 defines "cadre" as posts in various
classes, categories and grades in a service. "Service" has been defined
in Rule 2(30) as a post or a group of posts or categories of posts
classified by the State Government as State or Subordinate Service, as
the case may be. Rule 22 which deals with Special Representation
(Reservation) empowers the State Government to make a provision for
reservation in promotions. The said Rule refers to the implementation of
a 100-point roster for promotion to the next higher category. It would
be relevant to refer to the reservation policy of the State of Punjab
according to which reservation for SCs and STs is on the basis of roster
registers maintained for each category of posts. The State of Himachal
Pradesh has decided to provide reservation in promotions by following
the Explanatory Notes to the Office Memorandum issued by the
Government of India dated 2-7-1997.
30. It would be relevant to refer to the judgments of this Court
which have dealt with the scope of the expression "cadre". Rule 4(2) of
the Central Engineering Service, Class I, Recruitment Rules, 1954
provided that 75% of the vacancies in the grade of Executive Engineer,
Class I shall be filled by promotion from Assistant Executive Engineers,
Class I. Interpreting the words "vacancies in the grade of Executive
Engineer", this Court in A.K. Subraman V. Union of India81 held that the
word "grade" is used in the sense of cadre.
31. The dispute that arose for consideration of this Court in
Chakradhar Paswan V. State of Bihar82 relates to the posts of Director
and three Deputy Directors in the Directorate of Indigenous Medicines,
Department of Health, State of Bihar being grouped together for the
purpose of implementing the policy of reservation under Article 16(4) of
the Constitution of India. This Court was of the opinion that though the
Director and three Deputy Directors are Class I posts, the posts of
Director and Deputy Directors do not constitute one "cadre". It was held
that the term "cadre" has a definite legal connotation in service
jurisprudence. This Court referred to Fundamental Rule 9(4) which
defines the word "cadre" to mean the strength of a service or part of a
service sanctioned as a separate unit. It was observed that as the post
of Director is the highest post in the Directorate of Indigenous
Medicines for which a higher pay scale is prescribed in comparison to
Deputy Directors, who are entitled to a lower scale of pay, they
constitute two distinct cadres or grades. This Court further expressed
its view that it is open to the Government to constitute as many cadres
in any particular service as it may choose, according to administrative
convenience and expediency. This Court concluded that the post of
Director and Deputy Directors constitute different cadres in the service.
32. In K. Manickaraj V. Union of India83, the appellant was a Welfare
Inspector, Grade III belonging to Scheduled Caste category. He
claimed promotion to Grade II by contending that four posts were
reserved for Scheduled Castes as there were 26 Grade II posts. The
respondent contended that there were only 23 Grade II posts as three
Grade III posts which were temporarily upgraded to Grade II did not
form part of the cadre strength of Grade II Inspectors. While allowing
the appeal of K. Manickaraj, this Court recognised that promotions take
place from one grade to a higher grade, with the cadre strength for the
purpose of providing reservation in such promotion to be the total
number of posts available in the grade to which promotion was sought.
33. The meaning of "cadre" fell for consideration of this Court again
in Union of India V. Pushpa Rani84 "Cadre" in the 1985 Edn. of the
Railway Establishment Code is defined as the strength of a service or a
part of a service sanctioned as a separate unit. This Court held that the
posts sanctioned in different grades would constitute independent
cadres, even for the purpose of
implementing the roster. The reason for giving an enlarged meaning to
the term "cadre" was that the posts in the railway establishment are
sanctioned with reference to grades. Even temporary, work-charged,
supernumerary and shadow posts created in different grades can
constitute part of the cadre.
34. It is relevant to refer to another judgment of this Court in State
of Rajasthan V. Fateh Chand Soni wherein the meaning of
"promotion" was looked into. This Court held that "promotion" not only
covered advancement to higher position or rank but also implied
advancement to a higher grade.
35. Whether the officers serving in Arms, Arms Support and Services
comprise a single cadre for purposes of promotion was the question
adjudicated by this Court in Union of India V. P.K. Choudhary86. This
Court held that they do not constitute a single cadre, even though they
might be drawing the same salary, holding the same rank, wearing the
same uniform and serving the same employer with similar service
benefits. As the officers were allocated to different Arms and Services
which put them in distinct cadres, with promotional avenues being
made available against the posts comprising that cadre alone, there
cannot be constitution of a common cadre. This Court referred to an
earlier judgment in Sub-Inspector Rooplal V. Lt. Governor87 in which it
was held that equivalence of two posts is not judged by the sole factor
of equal pay. There are four factors in that regard, namely : (i) the
nature and duties of the post; (ii) the responsibilities and powers
exercised by the officer holding a post; the extent of territorial or other
charge held or responsibilities discharged; (iii) the minimum
qualifications, if any, prescribed for recruitment to the post; and (iv)
the salary of the post. This Court, in P.K. Choudhary was of the
further opinion that transferability or interchangeability of one
incumbent to another in the cadre are essential attributes of a common
cadre.
36. In R.K. Sabharwal this Court held that the right to be
considered for appointment can only be claimed in respect of a post in
a cadre and that the concept of "vacancy" has no relevance in operating
the percentage of reservation. It was further held that the cadre
strength is always measured by the number of posts comprising the
cadre.
37. It is clear from the above statutory regime and the law laid down
by this Court that civil posts under the Government are organised into
different services. A service constitutes "classes"/"groups" of posts. A
"class"/""group" is further bifurcated into grades. Though the
nomenclature might be different, the structure of services under the
Union and the States is similar. According to the instructions issued by
the Union of India, cadres are constituted for each grade. At the cost of
repetition, the Union of India submitted that there are 3800 cadres in
44 Ministries/Departments. Fundamental Rule 9(4) defines "cadre" to
mean the strength of a service or part of a service sanctioned as a
separate unit. It is the choice of a State to constitute cadres. The entire
service cannot be
considered to be a cadre for the purpose of promotion from one post to
a higher post in a different grade. Promotion is made from one grade to
the next higher grade, in relation to which cadres are constituted. This
Court in Chakradhar Paswan82 has categorically stated that the post of
Director and Deputy Director cannot form one cadre. A cadre is
constituted by the Government by taking into account several factors
within its sole discretion.
38. In the Office Memorandum dated 2-7-1997, the Union of India
set out the principles for making and operating post-based rosters, in
which it has been expressly stated that cadre is to be construed as the
number of posts in a particular grade. It is made clear that rosters have
been prepared grade-wise which are reviewed on a yearly basis and
that reservation in promotions is implemented on the basis of these
rosters, which operate grade-wise. In M. Nagaraj³, this Court approved
that the percentage of reservation in promotions was to be applied to
the entire cadre strength, as held in R.K. Sabharwal80. While doing so,
this Court in M. Nagaraj3 made it clear that the unit for operation of the
roster would be the cadre strength. Before providing for reservation in
promotions to a cadre, the State is obligated to collect quantifiable data
regarding inadequacy of representation of SCs and STs. Collection of
information regarding inadequacy of representation of SCs and STs
cannot be with reference to the entire service or "class"/""group" but it
should be relatable to the grade/category of posts to which promotion
is sought. Cadre, which should be the unit for the purpose of collection
of quantifiable data in relation to the promotional post(s), would be
meaningless if data pertaining to representation of SCs and STs is with
reference to the entire service.
(3) Proportionate representation as test of adequacy
39. In R.K. Sabharwal80, it was observed that State Governments
may take the total population of a particular Backward Class and its
representation in the State services for the purpose of coming to a
conclusion that there is inadequate representation in the State services.
40. In M. Nagaraj³, this Court was of the considered view that the
exercise of collecting quantifiable data depends on numerous factors,
with conflicting claims to be optimised by the administration in the
context of local prevailing conditions in public employment. As equity,
justice and efficiency are variable factors and are context-specific, how
these factors should be identified and counter-balanced will depend on
the facts and circumstances of each case. The attempt of the learned
Attorney General for India to impress upon this Court that the
proportion of SCs and STs in the population of India should be taken as
the test for determining whether they are adequately represented in
promotional posts, did not yield results.
41. This Court in Jarnail Singh 6 found no fault with M. Nagaraj3
regarding the test for determining the adequacy of representation in
promotional posts in the State. While emphasising the contrast in the
language used between Article 330 and Articles 16(4-A) and 16(4-B) of
the Constitution, this Court declined the invitation of the learned
Attorney General for India to hold that the proportion of SCs and STs to
the population of India should be the test for determining inadequacy
of representation in promotional posts. Therefore, we are not persuaded
to express any opinion on this aspect. It is for the State to assess the
inadequacy of representation of SCs and STs in promotional posts, by
taking into account relevant factors.
(4) Time period for review
42. There is near unanimity amongst the counsel for both sides that
the data collected to establish inadequacy of representation, which
forms the basis for providing reservation for promotions, should be
reviewed periodically. Ms Indira Jaising, learned Senior Counsel
appearing for members of the reserved categories, supported the
submissions of the learned Attorney General for India that a review
should be conducted every 10 years. Mr Gopal Sankaranarayanan,
learned Senior Counsel, submitted that it is time for reservation in
public employment to be discontinued. Additionally, he submitted that
the lion's share of reservation for members of SCs and STs accrued to
the benefit of a select few within these categories, which further
strengthened the requirement for review to appraise whether certain
groups/classes within these categories had achieved the desired
representation.
43. We are not inclined to express any view on discontinuation of
reservations in totality, which is completely within the domain of the
legislature and the executive. As regards review, we are of the opinion
that data collected to determine inadequacy of representation for the
purpose of providing reservation in promotions needs to be reviewed
periodically. The period for review should be reasonable and is left to
the Government to set out.
(5) Prospective operation of the judgment in M. Nagaraj³
44. While holding that Article 16(4-A) does not provide for
reservation in matters of promotion, this Court in Indra Sawhney1
saved the promotions that were already made. It was made clear that
the judgment shall operate only prospectively and shall not affect
promotions already made, whether on temporary, officiating or
regular/permanent basis. Already-existing provisions made for
reservation in promotions in Central or State services were permitted to
continue to operate for a period of five years from the date of the
judgment in Indra Sawhney1. Article 16(4-A) was brought into force
from 17-6-1995.
45. This Court upheld the validity of Article 16(4-A) in M. Nagaraj3
on 19-10-2006 and observed that reservation in promotions in public
services can be made, subject to collection of quantifiable data by the
State showing backwardness of the class and inadequacy of
representation of that class in public employment, in addition to
compliance with Article 335 of the Constitution. Reservation in
promotions provided by various State Governments and the Central
Government have been challenged in the High Courts on the ground of
non-compliance with the requirement of collection of quantifiable data
showing backwardness of the class and inadequacy of representation. It
is relevant to mention at this stage that collection of quantifiable data
regarding backwardness of SCs and STs is no more required in view of
the judgment of this Court in Jarnail Singh In respect of the data
relating to inadequacy of representation of SCs and STs, the High
Courts have adjudicated writ petitions which are the subject-matter of
special leave petitions pending in this Court.
46. The duty of the court is not to "pronounce a new law, but to
maintain and expound the old one". 88 Holmes, J., in his dissent in
"35.
I know of no authority in this Court to say that, in general,
State decisions shall make law only for the future. Judicial decisions
have had retrospective operation for near a thousand years."
47. In M. Nagaraj³, this Court upheld the constitutional validity of
Article 16(4-A), subject to the State collecting quantifiable data
showing inadequate representation. The law declared by this Court
interpreting Article 16(4-A) in M. Nagaraj3 applies from 17-6-1995 i.e.
the date on which Article 16(4-A) came into force. (See : Ravi S. Naik
V. Union of India90. Lily Thomas V. Union of India91.) The contention put
forth by the learned Attorney General for India and the learned counsel
appearing for the reserved category candidates, which requires to be
examined, is regarding the prospective applicability of the law laid
down in M. Nagaraj3 i.e. from the date of the judgment.
48. This Court, in Golak Nath V. State of Punjab 92 held that
Parliament had no power to amend Part III of the Constitution so as to
take away or abridge the fundamental rights. However, to save the past
transactions, the doctrine of prospective overruling was invoked and the
judgment was given prospective operation. The following propositions
were laid down in Golak Nath case92 : (AIR p. 1669, para 51)
"51.
(1) The doctrine of prospective overruling can be invoked
only in matters arising out of the Constitution;
(2) it can be applied only by the highest court of the country i.e.
the Supreme Court as it has the constitutional jurisdiction to declare
law binding on all the courts in India;
(3) the scope of the retroactive operation of the law declared by
the Supreme Court superseding its earlier decisions is left to its
discretion to be moulded in accordance with the justice of the cause
or matter before it."
While interpreting the scope of Article 142 of the Constitution, this
Court held that the law declared by the Supreme Court is the law of the
land and in so declaring, the operation of the law can be restricted to
the future, thereby saving past transactions.
49. The power of this Court under Article 142 of the Constitution is a
93
constituent power transcendental to statutory prohibition. In Orissa
Cement Ltd. V. State of Orissa94, this Court observed that relief can be
granted, moulded or restricted in a manner most appropriate to the
situation before it in such a way as to advance the interests of justice.
The doctrine of prospective overruling is in essence a recognition of the
principle that the Court moulds the reliefs claimed to meet the justice
of the case, as has been held in Somaiya Organics (India) Ltd. V. State
of U.P.° 95 It was further clarified that while in Golak Nath "prospective
overruling" implied an earlier judicial decision on the same issue which
was otherwise final, this Court had used the power even when deciding
on an issue for the first time. There is no need to refer to other
judgments of this Court which have approved and applied the principle
of prospective overruling or prospective operation of judgments. There
cannot be any manner of doubt that this Court can apply its decision
prospectively i.e. from the date of its judgment to save past
transactions.
50. While objecting to the contention of the learned Attorney
General for India to declare the law laid down by M. Nagaraj3 as having
prospective operation, Mr Rakesh Dwivedi, learned Senior Counsel
appearing for the unreserved candidates, submitted that relief can be
moulded in exercise of the power under Article 142 of the Constitution.
It is no doubt true that M. Nagaraj3 did not state that it would be
prospective in operation. It is necessary for this Court to examine
whether a judgment can be made prospectively applicable
subsequently by a different Bench of this Court. The doctrine of
prospective overruling was applied to Indian law in Golak Nath by
following the theory which was prevalent in the United States of
America. Reference was made to the judgment of Linkletter V. Walker96
which declared an earlier decision of the US Supreme Court in Mapp V.
Ohio97 to be prospective in operation.
51. For a better understanding, it is necessary to refer to the issue in
Linkletter The United States Supreme Court in Fremont Weeks V.
United States98 held that illegally-seized evidence cannot be used in
federal courts, by establishing the exclusionary rule. The applicability of
the exclusionary rule to States fell for consideration in Wolf V. People of
the State of Colorado99. Taking note of the fact that 16 States adopted
the exclusionary rule laid down in Weeks98 while 31 other States
rejected the exclusionary rule, the US Supreme Court held that it was
not a departure from basic standards of due process to allow States to
introduce illegally-obtained evidence in State trials. Later, the US
Supreme Court in Mapp97 held that the exclusion of evidence seized in
violation of search and seizure provisions of the Fourth Amendment was
required of the States by the due process clause of the Fourteenth
Amendment.
52. In Linkletter the US Supreme Court was confronted with the
question of prospective operation of its earlier judgment in Mapp97. The
overruling of the judgment in Wolf V. People of the State of Colorado99
by Mapp97 was made prospective by the US Supreme Court by making
22-25)
"22. We believe that the existence of the Wolf9 doctrine prior to
Mapp97 is 'an operative fact and may have consequences which
cannot justly be ignored. The past cannot always be erased by a new
judicial declaration'. Chicot County Drainage Dist. V. Baxter State
Bank100, US at p. 374 and S Ct at p. 319. The thousands of cases
that were finally decided on Wolf99 cannot be obliterated. The
'particular conduct, private and official," must be considered. Here
'prior determinations deemed to have finality and acted upon
accordingly' have become vested'. And finally, 'public policy in the
light of the nature both of the (Wolf99 doctrine) and of its previous
application' must be given its proper weight. Ibid. In short, we must
look to the purpose of the Mapp97 rule; the reliance placed upon the
Wolf29 doctrine; and the effect on the administration of justice of a
retrospective application of Mapp97.
23. It is clear that the Wolf9 Court, once it had found the Fourth
Amendment's unreasonable Search and Seizure Clause applicable to
the States through the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth
Amendment, turned its attention to whether the exclusionary rule
was included within the command of the Fourth Amendment. This
was decided in the negative. It is clear that based upon the factual
considerations heretofore discussed the Wolf99 Court then concluded
that it was not necessary to the enforcement of the Fourth
Amendment for the exclusionary rule to be extended to
the States as a requirement of due process. Mapp97 had as its prime
purpose the enforcement of the Fourth Amendment through the
inclusion of the exclusionary rule within its rights. This, it was found,
was the only effective deterrent to lawless police action. Indeed, all of
the cases since Wolf99 requiring the exclusion of illegal evidence have
been based on the necessity for an effective deterrent to illegal police
action. See e.g. Rea V. United States101. We cannot say that this
purpose would be advanced by making the rule retrospective. The
misconduct of the police prior to Mapp97 has already occurred and will
not be corrected by releasing the prisoners involved. Nor would it add
harmony to the delicate State-federal relationship of which we have
spoken as part and parcel of the purpose of Mapp97. Finally, the
ruptured privacy of the victims' homes and effects cannot be restored.
Reparation comes too late.
24. It is true that both the accused and the States relied upon
Wolf Indeed, Wolf9 and Irvine102 each pointed the way for the
victims of illegal searches to seek reparation for the violation of their
privacy. Some pursued the same. See Monroe V. Pape103 In
addition, in Irvine, a flag in a concurring opinion warned that Wolf99
was in stormy weather. On the other hand, the States relied on
Wolf99 and followed its command. Final judgments of conviction were
entered prior to Mapp97. Again and again this Court refused to
reconsider Wolf9 and gave its implicit approval to hundreds of cases
in their application of its rule. In rejecting the Wolf99 doctrine as to
the exclusionary rule the purpose was to deter the lawless action of
the police and to effectively enforce the Fourth Amendment. That
purpose will not at this late date be served by the wholesale release
of the guilty victims.
25. Finally, there are interests in the administration of justice and
the integrity of the judicial process to consider. To make the rule of
Mapp97 retrospective would tax the administration of justice to the
utmost. Hearings would have to be held on the excludability of
evidence long since destroyed, misplaced or deteriorated. If it is
excluded, the witnesses available at the time of the original trial will
not be available or if located their memory will be dimmed. To thus
legitimate such an extraordinary procedural weapon that has no
bearing on guilt would seriously disrupt the administration of
justice."
53. The point to be noticed is that the US Supreme Court in
Linkletter declared its earlier judgment in Mapp97 to be prospective in
operation, after considering the consequences of Mapp97 97 being given
retrospective effect.
54. This Court in Indra Sawhney1 interpreted Article 16(4-A) of the
Constitution by holding that reservation cannot be provided in
promotions. However, reservation in promotions were permitted for a
further period of five years from the date of the judgment. In Ashok
Kumar Gupta V. State of U.P.93 , promotions in Public Works Department
of the Government of Uttar Pradesh were challenged. One of the
grounds of challenge was that the direction of the Supreme Court for
prospective overruling of the judgment of this Court in Southern
Railway V. Rangachari104 and for operation of the ratio in Indra
Sawhney1 after five years from the date of the judgment was
inconsistent with and contrary to the scheme of the Constitution. In
other words, it was contended by the appellants in Ashok Kumar
Gupta93 93 that after having declared reservation in promotions under
Articles 16(1) and 16(4) as unconstitutional and overruling
Rangachari10 as not being correct in law, the Court cannot postpone
the operation of the judgment to a future date as it amounts to
perpetration of void action and is violative of the appellants'
fundamental rights.
55. In Ashok Kumar Gupta93, , this Court was of the opinion that
there is no prohibition for this Court to postpone the operation of the
judgment in Indra Sawhney1 or to prospectively overrule the ratio in
Rangachari10 This Court further held that : (Ashok Kumar Gupta
"60. It would be seen that there is no limitation under Article 142
(1) on the exercise of the power by this Court. The necessity to
exercise the power is to do "complete justice in the cause or matter".
The inconsistency with statute law made by Parliament arises when
this Court exercises power under Article 142(2) for the matters
enumerated therein. Inconsistency in express statutory provisions of
substantive law would mean and be understood as some express
prohibition contained in any substantive statutory law. The power
under Article 142 is a constituent power transcendental to statutory
prohibition. Before exercise of the power under Article 142(2), the
Court would take that prohibition (sic provision) into consideration
before taking steps under Article 142(2) and we find no limiting
words to mould the relief or when this Court takes appropriate
decision to mete out justice or to remove injustice. The phrase
"complete justice" engrafted in Article 142(1) is the word of width
couched with elasticity to meet myriad situations created by human
ingenuity or cause or result of operation of statute law or law
declared under Articles 32, 136 and 141 of the Constitution and
cannot be cribbed or cabined within any limitations or phraseology.
Each case needs examination in the light of its
backdrop and the indelible effect of the decision. In the ultimate
analysis, it is for this Court to exercise its power to do complete justice
or prevent injustice arising from the exigencies of the cause or matter
before it. The question of lack of jurisdiction or nullity of the order of
this Court does not arise. As held earlier, the power under Article 142 is
a constituent power within the jurisdiction of this Court. So, the
question of a law being void ab initio or nullity or voidable does not
arise.
61. Admittedly, the Constitution has entrusted this salutary duty
to this Court with power to remove injustice or to do complete
justice in any cause or matter before this Court. Rangachari104 104 ratio
was in operation for well over three decades under which reservation
in promotions were given to several persons in several services,
grades or cadres of the Union of India or the respective State
Governments. This Court, with a view to see that there would not be
any hiatus in the operation of that law and, as held earlier, to bring
about smooth transition of the operation of law of reservation in
promotions, by a judicial creativity extended the principle of
prospective overruling applied in Golak Nath case92 in the case of
105
statutory law and of the judicial precedent in Karunakar case and
further elongated the principle postponing the operation of the
judgment in Mandal case1 for five years from the date of the
judgment. This judicial creativity is not anathema to constitutional
principle but an accepted doctrine as an extended facet of stare
decisis. It would not be labelled as proviso to Article 16(4) as
contended for."
56. Whether the judgment of this Court in Indian Council for Enviro-
Legal Action V. Union of India¹06 was prospective was the subject-
matter of consideration in Goan Real Estate & Construction Ltd. V. Union
of India¹. After a detailed consideration of the judgment in Indian
Council for Enviro-Legal Action10 , this Court in Goan Real Estate107
concluded that though not stated categorically in Indian Council for
Enviro-Legal Action106 it was the intention of this Court to give
prospective effect to the judgment. The above is an instance where this
Court declared an earlier judgment to have prospective effect.
57. A contrary view was expressed by this Court in M.A. Murthy V.
State of Karnataka108 in which it was held that prospective overruling
can be done only by the Court which has rendered the decision. The
dispute that arose for consideration of this Court in the said judgment
pertained to appointment to the posts of Manager (Finance and
Accounts) in the Karnataka State Financial Corporation. The appellants
challenged the selection of Respondent 4 before
the Karnataka High Court. Though the learned Single Judge of the High
Court found Respondent 4 therein to be ineligible as on the date of his
appointment, the selection was not disturbed on the ground that he
obtained qualifications by the time of interview. The learned Single
Judge relied upon the judgment of this Court in Ashok Kumar Sharma
V. Chander Shekher109 (Ashok Kumar Sharma case No. 1). The
judgment of the learned Single Judge was upheld by the Division Bench
of the High Court. Thereafter, a review application was filed informing
the Division Bench of the High Court that the judgment of this Court in
Ashok Kumar Sharma case No. 1109 was overruled in Ashok Kumar
Sharma V. Chander Shekhar110 (Ashok Kumar Sharma case No. 2). By
holding that on the date of the judgment of the Division Bench, Ashok
Kumar Sharma case No. 1 109 held the field, the High Court dismissed
the review petition. Taking note of the fact that Ashok Kumar Sharma
case No. 2110 was a judgment of this Court in review of the judgment in
Ashok Kumar Sharma case No. 1109, , which, therefore, merged with the
subsequent judgment, making the later decision the one and only
judgment rendered for all purposes, this Court found that the High
Court had committed an error in not following the law laid down by this
Court in Ashok Kumar Sharma case No. 2110 . While holding so, this
Court referred to the doctrine of prospective overruling and earlier
judgments of this Court in Golak Nath Ashok Kumar Gupta 93 and
others. This Court proceeded to observe that there shall be no
prospective overruling unless it is so indicated in a particular decision.
58. The facts of the case and the dispute resolved by this Court in
M.A. Murthy108 relate to the applicability of the subsequent judgment of
Ashok Kumar Sharma case No. 2110 rendered in review of an earlier
judgment. The question of prospective overruling did not arise in the
said case. The observation made in M.A. Murthy108 that there shall be
no prospective overruling unless indicated in the particular decision is
obiter.
59. Obiter dictum is defined in Black's Law Dictionary (9th Edn.,
2009), as follows:
"Obiter dictum.-
A judicial comment made while delivering a
judicial opinion, but one that is unnecessary to the decision in the
case and therefore not precedential (although it may be considered
persuasive) - Often shortened to dictum or, less commonly, obiter.
Strictly speaking an "obiter dictum" is a remark made or opinion
expressed by a Judge, in his decision upon a cause, "by the way"-
that is, incidentally or collaterally, and not directly upon the question
before the court; or it is any statement of law enunciated by the
Judge or court merely by way of illustration, argument, analogy, or
suggestion In the
common speech of lawyers, all such extra-judicial expressions of legal
opinion are referred to as "dicta", or "obiter dicta", these two terms
being used interchangeably."
60. Wharton's Law Lexicon (14th Edn., 1993) defines the term
"obiter dictum" as
"an opinion not necessary to a judgment; an observation as to the law made by a
Judge in the course of a case, but not necessary to its decision, and therefore,
of no binding effect; often called as obiter dictum, 'a remark by the way".
A decision on a point not necessary for the purpose of or which does not
fall for determination in that decision becomes an obiter dictum.
111
61. It is a well-settled proposition that only the ratio decidendi can
act as the binding or authoritative precedent. Reliance placed on mere
general observations or casual expressions of the Court, is not of much
avail. 112 Therefore, the casual and unnecessary observation in M.A.
Murthy108 that there shall be no prospective overruling unless it is so
indicated in a particular decision is obiter and not binding. Moreover, in
M.A. Murthy108, this Court failed to consider the ratio of the judgment
of this Court in Ashok Kumar Gupta93, even after referring to it. As
stated above, the prospective overruling of Rangachari104 by Indra
Sawhney1 was upheld in Ashok Kumar Gupta93
62. This Court in Golak Nath92 and Ashok Kumar Gupta93, referred to
above, has laid down that Article 142 empowers this Court to mould the
relief to do complete justice. To conclude this point, the purpose of
holding that M. Nagaraj3 would have prospective effect is only to avoid
chaos and confusion that would ensue from its retrospective operation,
as it would have a debilitating effect on a very large number of
employees, who may have availed of reservation in promotions without
there being strict compliance of the conditions prescribed in M.
Nagaraj³. Most of them would have already retired from service on
attaining the age of superannuation. The judgment of M. Nagaraj was
delivered in 2006, interpreting Article 16(4-A) of the Constitution which
came into force in 1995. As making the principles laid down in M.
Nagaraj effective from the year 1995 would be detrimental to the
interests of a number of civil servants and would have an effect of
unsettling the seniority of individuals over a long period of time, it is
necessary that the judgment of M. Nagaraj3 should be declared to have
prospective effect.
(6) Quantifiable data and sampling method
The Karnataka Legislature enacted the Karnataka Determination
of Seniority of the Government Servants Promoted on the Basis of
Reservation (to the Posts in the Civil Services of the State) Act, 2002.
This Court declared the provisions of the said Act as unconstitutional on
the ground that the Government of Karnataka failed to produce
quantifiable data to show any compelling necessity for exercising power
under Article 16(4-A) and therefore, Sections 3 and 4 of the said Act
were held to be unconstitutional. Thereafter, the Government of
Karnataka constituted a committee, headed by the Additional Chief
Secretary to the State of Karnataka, and entrusted the following tasks
to the committee:
"(1) Collect information in cadre-wise representation of SCs and
STs in all the government departments.
(2) Collect information regarding backwardness of SCs and STs.
(3) Study the effect on the administration due to the provision of
reservation in promotion to SCs and STs."
64. On 5-5-2017, the "Report on Backwardness, Inadequacy of
Representation and Administrative Efficiency in Karnataka" was
submitted by the Ratna Prabha Committee. The Government of
Karnataka accepted the Report and the Karnataka Extension of
Consequential Seniority to Government Servants Promoted on the Basis
of Reservation (to the Posts in the Civil Services of the State) Bill, 2017
was passed by the Legislative Assembly and the Legislative Council and
thereafter, received Presidential assent on 14-6-2018. The grievance of
the petitioners therein was that the data was collected only from 31
departments out of a total of 62, based on Groups 'A', 'B', 'C' and 'D'
and not on cadre. A further complaint was made that no data was
collected with respect to public sector undertakings, boards,
corporations, local bodies, grant-in-aid institutions and autonomous
bodies, and therefore, the data is only representative in nature.
para 101) a summary of the Ratna Prabha Committee Report, which is
as follows:
"101.
2.5. Summary:
(1) The analysis of time series data collected for the last 32 years
(1984-2016) except for 1986) across 31 departments of the State
Government provides the rich information on the inadequacy of
representation of SC and ST employees in various cadres of
Karnataka Civil Services.
(2) The total number of sanctioned posts as per the data of 2016
is 7,45,593 of which 70.22% or 5,23,574 are filled up across 31
departments.
(3) The vacancies or posts are filled up through Direct
Recruitment (DR) and Promotions including consequential
promotion.
(4) The overall representation of the SC and ST employees of all
31 departments in comparison with total sanctioned posts comprises
of 10.65% and 2.92% respectively. This proves inadequacy of
representation of SCs and STs.
(5) On an average the representation in Cadre A for SCs is at
12.07% and STs 2.70% which sufficiently proves the inadequacy of
representation.
(6) The extent of representation in Cadre B is on an average of
9.79% and 2.34% for STs for all the years of the study period.
(7) It is observed that on an average 3.05% of SC representation
is inadequate in the Cadre 'C' whereas, 0.05% excess representation
is seen for STs.
(8) On an average of 2% and 1% over-representation of
employees of SCs and STs is found in Cadre D respectively. However,
in the last 5 years, inadequacy of representation of SCs by 3% is
found in this cadre.
(9) The representation of Scheduled Caste in Cadres A, B and C is
on an average 12, 9.79 and 12.04% respectively whereas in Cadre D
it is 16.91.
(10) In case of STs in the Cadres A and B the representation is
2.70 and 2.34%. However, excess representation of 0.04 and 0.93%
is found in case of Group C and Group D respectively.
(11) Over-representation in some years and departments is
attributed to either Direct Recruitment or retirement of employees or
filling up of backlog vacancies as the latter does not fall under 50%
limitation of reservation.
2.6. Conclusion:
The data clearly shows the inadequacy of representation of SCs
and STs in the civil services in Groups A, B and C and adequate
representation in Group D."
66. This Court in B.K. Pavitra (2)2 75 found the challenge to the Report
on the ground of data having been collected on the basis of Groups A,
B, C and D as opposed to cadres, to be without merit. The basis of the
said conclusion of the Court was that there is no fixed meaning ascribed
to the term "cadre" in service jurisprudence. Further, this Court held
that collection of quantifiable data on the inadequacy of representation
is in the services of the State, according to M. Nagaraj³. In addition,
this Court was also of the view that Article 16(4-A) referred to
inadequacy of representation in the services of the State. It was further
declared that collection of data on the basis of groups does not exclude
data pertaining to cadres, as a group includes posts in all the cadres in
that group.
67. Collection of quantifiable data for determining the inadequacy of
representation of SCs and STs is a basic requirement for providing
reservation in promotions, as laid down by this Court in M. Nagaraj³.
The unit for
the purpose of collection of data is a cadre, according to M. Nagaraj3
and Jarnail Singh5 For the purpose of collection of quantifiable data for
providing reservation in promotions, the entire service cannot be taken
to be a unit and treated as a cadre, as already stated. The structure of
services in the State of Karnataka is along the same lines as that of
services in the Central Government. Services are divided into "groups",
which are further bifurcated into cadres. There is no confusion that a
cadre is not synonymous with a "group".
68. The first term of reference for the Ratna Prabha Committee was
to collect data cadre-wise. The conclusion of this Court in B.K. Pavitra
(2)
75 that the expression "cadre" has no fixed meaning in service
jurisprudence is contrary to the judgments of this Court, which have
been referred to above while answering Point 2. In clear terms, M.
Nagaraj held that the unit for collection of quantifiable data is cadre,
and not services as has been held in B.H K. Pavitra (2) 75 Article 16(4-A)
of the Constitution enables the State to make reservation in promotions
for SCs and STs, which are not adequately represented in the services
of the State. However, the provision for reservation in matters of
promotion is with reference to class or classes of posts in the services
under the State. That "groups" consist of cadres is a fact which was
taken into consideration by this Court in B.K. Pavitra (2) 75 The
conclusion that the collection of data on the basis of "groups" is valid, is
contrary to the decisions of this Court in M. Nagaraj3 and Jarnail Singh6.
69. The State should justify reservation in promotions with respect
to the cadre to which promotion is made. Taking into account the data
pertaining to a "group", which would be an amalgamation of certain
cadres in a service, would not give the correct picture of the inadequacy
of representation of SCs and STs in the cadre in relation to which
reservation in promotions is sought to be made. Rosters are prepared
cadre-wise and not group-wise. Sampling method which was adopted
by the Ratna Prabha Committee might be a statistical formula
appropriate for collection of data. However, for the purpose of collection
of quantifiable data to assess representation of SCs and STs for the
purpose of providing reservation in promotions, cadre, which is a part of
a "group", is the unit and the data has to be collected with respect to
each cadre. Therefore, we hold that the conclusion of this Court in B.K.
Pavitra (2)75 approving the collection of data on the basis of "groups"
and not cadres is contrary to the law laid down by this Court in M.
Nagaraj3 and Jarnail Singh6.
70. It is made clear that we have not expressed any opinion on the
merits of any individual case as we have only answered the common
issues that were formulated after hearing the parties.
71. List the matters on 24-2-2022 for further hearing.
