reiterated
(Paras 19 and 20)
Held :
A stage has come where applications under Section 156(3) CrPC are to be
supported by an affidavit duly sworn by the complainant who seeks the invocation
of the jurisdiction of the Magistrate.
(Paras 23 and 24)
to
In an appropriate case, the Magistrate would be well advised to verify the truth
and also verify the veracity of the allegations. Applications under Section 156(3)
CrPC are filed in a routine manner without taking any responsibility only to harass
certain persons.
(Para 25)
Prior to the filing of a petition under Section 156(3) CrPC, there have to be
applications under Sections 154(1) and 154(3) CrPC. The necessity to file an
affidavit is so that the persons making the application should be conscious and not
make false affidavit. With such a requirement, the persons would be deterred from
causally invoking authority of the Magistrate, under Section 156(3) CrPC inasmuch
as if the affidavit is found to be false, the person would be liable for prosecution in
accordance with law.
(Para 26)
In the present case, it is clear that the Magistrate while passing the order under
Section 156(3) CrPC, has totally failed to consider the law laid down by the
Supreme Court.
(Paras 22 and 27)
In the present case, though civil suits have been filed with regard to the same
transactions and though they are contested by Respondent 2 by filing written
statement, he has chosen to file complaint under Section 156(3) CrPC after a
period of one-and-a-half years from the date of filing of written statement with an
ulterior motive of harassing the appellants. The present case fits in the category of
(Para 21)
applied
From the perusal of the complaint it can be seen that, the complainant
Respondent 2 himself has made averments with regard to the filing of the original
suit. In any case, when the complaint was not supported by an affidavit, the
Magistrate ought not to have entertained the application under Section 156(3)
CrPC. The High Court has also failed to take into consideration the legal position as
has been enunciated by the Supreme Court in Priyanka Srivastava case, and has
dismissed the petitions by merely observing that serious allegations are made in the
complaint.

The Judgment of the Court was delivered by
B.R. GAVAI, J. Leave granted. The present appeals challenge the
four judgments and orders dated 22-1-2021 1, 2, 3, 4 , passed
by
the
High Court of Karnataka at Bengaluru, thereby dismissing the criminal
petitions filed by the present appellants under Section 482 of the Code
of Criminal Procedure (hereinafter referred to as "CrPC").
2. The facts in brief giving rise to the present appeals, taken from
the appeal arising out of Special Leave Petition (Crl.) No. 2183 of 2021,
are as under.
3. Appellants 2 and 3 on one hand and Respondent 2 on the other
hand, entered into various agreements for sale with respect to
properties situated at Bangalore. According to the appellants, the
amounts as mentioned in the agreements, were paid by them as
consideration by three cheques, one of them drawn from the account of
Appellant 1, another one from account of M/s S.S.R.V Trans Solutions
and other one from the account of M/s Shobha Tours and Travels, which
are operated by Appellant 1. All these three cheques were bearer
cheques. It is the case of the appellants that, all the cheques were
encashed by Respondent 2.
4. It is the case of the appellants that, after receipt of the payments,
Respondent 2 was avoiding to get the sale deed registered. As such,
Appellants 2 and 3 on 24-11-2017 had filed four different suits being
OSs Nos. 8020, 8018, 1616 and 1614 of 2017, before the Courts of
Principal Senior Civil Judge and Principal City Civil Judge at Bangalore,
for specific performance of contract. Respondent 2, who is Defendant 1
in os No. 8020 of 2017, filed his written statement on 9-4-2018.
5. Respondent 2, thereafter filed a complaint dated 10-9-2019, with
Tilak Nagar Police Station, Jayanagar, Bengaluru, against the
appellants, thereby making allegations of cheating. Thereafter,
following a gap of almost one year, Respondent 2 filed private
complaint being PCR No. 12445 of 2019 on 18-9-2019, before the
Court of IInd Additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate, Bangalore.
6. On the same day, Respondent 2, along with his wife who is
Respondent 3 in the rest of the appeals arising out of Special Leave
Petitions (Crl.) Nos. 2182, 2162 and 2217 of 2021, filed three other
private complaints being PCRs Nos. 12441, 12443 and 12444 of 2019
before the same court.
7. The allegations in the complaints are basically that Appellant 1,
who is the son of Appellants 2 and 3, had obtained blank stamp papers
from the respondents and created agreements for sale by misusing the
said blank stamp papers. As such, it is case of the respondents that,
the appellants committed forgery and cheated them, and as such they
are liable for punishment for the offences punishable under Sections
420, 464, 465, 468 and 120-B of the Penal Code (hereinafter referred
to as "IPC").
8. The IInd Additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate, at Bangalore on
6-12-2019, passed the order as under:
"The complainant has filed the present private complaint under
Section 200 CrPC, against Accused 1 to 3 for the alleged offences
punishable under Sections 420, 465, 468, 464 and 120-B IPC. In the
complaint, the complainant has made serious allegations against the
accused persons. Therefore, it appears to this court that, it is just
and proper to refer the matter to the jurisdictional police for
investigation and submit report. Accordingly, the matter is referred
to PSI of Jayanagar Police Station under Section 156(3) CrPC for
investigation and submit report by 26-2-2020."
9. On the basis of the same, First Information Report (hereinafter
referred to as "the FIR") No. 258 of 2019 came to be registered at
Jayanagar Police Station, Bengaluru City on 18-12-2019, for the
offences punishable under Sections 120-B, 420, 471, 468, 465 IPC.
Three similar FIRs came to registered against the appellants on
different dates in December 2019.
10. The appellants thereafter filed petitions under Section 482 CrPC
before the High Court of Karnataka at Bengaluru, being Criminal
Petitions Nos. 6719, 6733, 6729 and 6737 of 2020. The main
contention of the appellants in the criminal petitions was that, the order
under Section 156(3) CrPC was passed
in a mechanical manner by the IInd Additional Chief Metropolitan
Magistrate, at Bangalore.
11. It was submitted that, the Magistrate was required to apply his
mind before passing an order under Section 156(3) CrPC. It was further
submitted that, unless an application under Section 156(3) CrPC was
supported by an affidavit duly sworn by the complainant, the learned
Magistrate could not have passed an order under the said provision.
12. It was further submitted that the dispute was purely civil in
nature and the criminal complaint was filed by the respondents only to
harass the appellants. The Single Judge of the High Court vide four
identical impugned orders dated 22-1-2021 1, 2, 3, 4,
dismissed
the
petitions on the ground that, serious allegations of cheating and forgery
were shown in the complaint and as such no case was made out for
quashing the FIRs.
13. We have heard Shri Abdul Azeem Kalebudde, learned counsel
appearing on behalf of the appellants and Shri Shubhranshu Padhi,
learned counsel appearing on behalf of the State. In spite of being duly
served, none appeared for Respondent 2.
14. It is not in dispute that, apart from os No. 8020 of 2017,
Appellants 2 and 3 have filed suits being OSs Nos. 1614, 1616 and
8018 of 2017, seeking specific performance of contract with regard to
the agreements for sale between Appellants 2 and 3 on one hand and
Respondent 2 on the other hand. The said suits were filed on 24-11-
2017.
15. It is also not in dispute that, written statements have been filed
by Respondent 2 in all the said suits, between the period from 9-4-
2018 to 1-8-2018. It is the defence of Respondent 2 that, Appellant 1
who is the son of Appellants 2 and 3, is a moneylender and he lends
money at a high rate of interest. It is the further defence of Respondent
2 that, when the respondents approached Appellant 1 for financial help,
he used to take the respondents' signatures on the blank paper and
also collected cheques signed by Respondent 2 as security for said loan.
16. It is the further contention of Respondent 2 that he had
discharged the debt of Appellant 1 by paying an amount of Rs
56,50,000 (Rupees fifty-six lakhs and fifty thousand only) by way of
RTGS to the account of Appellant 1. The execution of agreements for
sale was specifically denied by Respondent 2.
17. After filing of the written statement on 9-4-2018 in os No. 8020
of 2017, Respondent 2 on 10-9-2019 filed a complaint before Police
Station Jayanagar, stating therein that, Appellant 1 had created forged
documents with regard to the properties belonging to Respondent 2
and his wife. He has stated in the said complaint that he has not signed
the documents and that the appellants
were taking advantage of the blank cheques and blank stamp papers.
Thereafter on 18-9-2019, Respondent 2 filed a private complaint being
PCR No. 12445 of 2019. He along with his wife filed three other private
complaints being PCRs Nos. 12441, 12443 and 12444 of 2019 before
the Court of IInd Additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate, Bangalore,
out of which the present proceedings arise.
18. It could thus be clearly seen that, the said complaint dated 10-9
-2019, was filed almost after a period of two years from the date of
institution of suits by Appellants 2 and 3, and almost after a period of
one-and-a-half years from the date on which written statement was
filed by Respondent 2.
19. It will be relevant to refer to the following observations of this
378-79, paras 102-103)
"102. In the backdrop of the interpretation of the various relevant
provisions of the Code under Chapter XIV and of the principles of law
enunciated by this Court in a series of decisions relating to the
exercise of the extraordinary power under Article 226 or the inherent
powers under Section 482 of the Code which we have extracted and
reproduced above, we give the following categories of cases by way
of illustration wherein such power could be exercised either to
prevent abuse of the process of any court or otherwise to secure the
ends of justice, though it may not be possible to lay down any
precise, clearly defined and sufficiently channelised and inflexible
guidelines or rigid formulae and to give an exhaustive list of myriad
kinds of cases wherein such power should be exercised:
(1) Where the allegations made in the first information report
or the complaint, even if they are taken at their face value and
accepted in their entirety do not prima facie constitute any
offence or make out a case against the accused.
(2) Where the allegations in the first information report and
other materials, if any, accompanying the FIR do not disclose a
cognizable offence, justifying an investigation by police officers
under Section 156(1) of the Code except under an order of a
Magistrate within the purview of Section 155(2) of the Code.
(3) Where the uncontroverted allegations made in the FIR or
complaint and the evidence collected in support of the same do
not disclose the commission of any offence and make out a case
against the accused.
(4) Where, the allegations in the FIR do not constitute a
cognizable offence but constitute only a non-cognizable offence,
no investigation is permitted by a police officer without an order
of a Magistrate as contemplated under Section 155(2) of the
Code.
(5) Where the allegations made in the FIR or complaint are so
absurd and inherently improbable on the basis of which no
prudent person can ever reach a just conclusion that there is
sufficient ground for proceeding against the accused.
(6) Where there is an express legal bar engrafted in any of the
provisions of the Code or the Act concerned (under which a
criminal proceeding is instituted) to the institution and
continuance of the proceedings and/or where there is a specific
provision in the Code or the Act concerned, providing efficacious
redress for the grievance of the aggrieved party.
(7) Where a criminal proceeding is manifestly attended with
mala fides and/or where the proceeding is maliciously instituted
with an ulterior motive for wreaking vengeance on the accused
and with a view to spite him due to private and personal grudge.
103. We also give a note of caution to the effect that the power of
quashing a criminal proceeding should be exercised very sparingly
and with circumspection and that too in the rarest of rare cases; that
the court will not be justified in embarking upon an enquiry as to the
reliability or genuineness or otherwise of the allegations made in the
FIR or the complaint and that the extraordinary or inherent powers
do not confer an arbitrary jurisdiction on the court to act according to
its whim or caprice."
20. It could thus be seen that, though this Court has cautioned that,
power to quash criminal proceedings should be exercised very sparingly
and with circumspection and that too in the rarest of rare cases, it has
specified certain category of cases wherein such power can be exercised
for quashing proceedings.
21. We find that in the present case, though civil suits have been
filed with regard to the same transactions and though they are
contested by Respondent 2 by filing written statement, he has chosen
to file complaint under Section 156(3) CrPC after a period of one-and-a
-half years from the date of filing of written statement with an ulterior
motive of harassing the appellants. We find that, the present case fits
in the category of No. 7, as mentioned in State of Haryana V. Bhajan
Lal5.
22. Further we find that, the present appeals deserve to be allowed
on another ground.
23. After analysing the law as to how the power under Section 156
(3) CrPC has to be exercised, this Court in Priyanka Srivastava V. State
"30. In our considered opinion, a stage has come in this country
where Section 156(3) CrPC applications are to be supported by an
affidavit duly sworn by the applicant who seeks the invocation of the
jurisdiction of the Magistrate. That apart, in an appropriate case, the
learned Magistrate would
be well advised to verify the truth and also can verify the veracity of the
allegations. This affidavit can make the applicant more responsible. We
are compelled to say so as such kind of applications are being filed in a
routine manner without taking any responsibility whatsoever only to
harass certain persons. That apart, it becomes more disturbing and
alarming when one tries to pick up people who are passing orders
under a statutory provision which can be challenged under the
framework of the said Act or under Article 226 of the Constitution of
India. But it cannot be done to take undue advantage in a criminal
court as if somebody is determined to settle the scores.
31. We have already indicated that there has to be prior
applications under Sections 154(1) and 154(3) while filing a petition
under Section 156(3). Both the aspects should be clearly spelt out in
the application and necessary documents to that effect shall be filed.
The warrant for giving a direction that an application under Section
156(3) be supported by an affidavit is so that the person making the
application should be conscious and also endeavour to see that no
false affidavit is made. It is because once an affidavit is found to be
false, he will be liable for prosecution in accordance with law. This
will deter him to casually invoke the authority of the Magistrate
under Section 156(3). That apart, we have already stated that the
veracity of the same can also be verified by the learned Magistrate,
regard being had to the nature of allegations of the case. We are
compelled to say so as a number of cases pertaining to fiscal sphere,
matrimonial dispute/family disputes, commercial offences, medical
negligence cases, corruption cases and the cases where there is
abnormal delay/laches in initiating criminal prosecution, as are
illustrated in Lalita Kumari7 are being filed. That apart, the learned
Magistrate would also be aware of the delay in lodging of the FIR."
24. This Court has clearly held that, a stage has come where
applications under Section 156(3) CrPC are to be supported by an
affidavit duly sworn by the complainant who seeks the invocation of the
jurisdiction of the Magistrate.
25. This Court further held that, in an appropriate case, the learned
Magistrate would be well advised to verify the truth and also verify the
veracity of the allegations. The Court has noted that, applications under
Section 156(3) CrPC are filed in a routine manner without taking any
responsibility only to harass certain persons.
26. This Court has further held that, prior to the filing of a petition
under Section 156(3) CrPC, there have to be applications under
Sections 154(1) and 154(3) CrPC. This Court emphasises the necessity
to file an affidavit so that the persons making the application should be
conscious and not make false affidavit. With such a requirement, the
persons would be deterred from causally invoking authority of the
Magistrate, under Section 156(3) CrPC. Inasmuch as if the affidavit is
found to be false, the person would be liable for prosecution in
accordance with law.
27. In the present case, we find that the learned Magistrate while
passing the order under Section 156(3) CrPC, has totally failed to
consider the law laid down by this Court.
28. From the perusal of the complaint it can be seen that, the
complainant Respondent 2 himself has made averments with regard to
the filing of the original suit. In any case, when the complaint was not
supported by an affidavit, the Magistrate ought not to have entertained
the application under Section 156(3) CrPC. The High Court has also
failed to take into consideration the legal position as has been
enunciated by this Court in Priyanka Srivastava V. State of U.P. 6 and
has dismissed the petitions by merely observing that serious
allegations are made in the complaint.
29. We are, therefore, of the considered view that, continuation of
the present proceedings would amount to nothing but an abuse of
process of law.
30. We therefore, allow these appeals and set aside the judgments
and orders of the High Court dated 22-1-2021, passed in Babu
