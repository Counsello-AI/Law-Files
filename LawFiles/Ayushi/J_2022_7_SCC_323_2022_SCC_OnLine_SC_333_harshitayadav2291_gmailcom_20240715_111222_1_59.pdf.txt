taken by Union Government was based on Koshyari Committee Report but
modalities for its implementation were yet to be determined - It was only
after modalities were finalised Communication dt. 7-11-2015 was issued -
Further held, expression "automatically" was not linked to time period for
revision of pension - Moreover, expression "to be automatically passed on"
immediately follows words "any future enhancement in rates of pension" -
Read together contextually, it signifies that rates of pension would be
passed on to past pensioners without administrative impediments -
Expression "automatically passed on" cannot be construed as commitment

was not linked to time period for pension revision - Moreover, even
assuming that expression "automatically" meant that revision in pension
rate would take place on ongoing basis rather than at periodic intervals,
doctrine of legitimate expectation would be inapplicable since there was no

A petition under Article 32 of the Constitution was filed challenging the manner in
which the "One Rank One Pension" ("OROP") policy for ex-servicemen of defence
forces was implemented by Respondent 1 UoI. The OROP was envisaged as a
uniform pension to be paid to armed forces personnel retiring in the same rank with
the same length of service, irrespective of their date of retirement, where any
future enhancements in the rates of pension were to be automatically passed on to
the past pensioners. The intention was to bridge the gap between the rate of
pension of current pensioners and the past pensioners. The petitioners alleged that
the initial definition of OROP was altered by the first respondent vide Letter dated 7-
11-2015 issued to the Chiefs of Defence Forces and instead of automatic revision
of rates of pension, revision was now sought to be made at periodic intervals which
was arbitrary violating Articles 14 and 21 of the Constitution.
Held :
The adoption of OROP as a guiding statement of policy on 7-11-2015 was
preceded by discussions both within and outside Parliament. The Koshyari
Committee submitted its Report on 10-12-2011. According to the Report of the
Committee, OROP implies that a "uniform pension be paid to the armed forces
personnel retiring in the same rank with the same length of service irrespective of
their date of retirement and any future enhancements in the rate of pension to be
automatically passed on to the past pensioners". The concept, according to the
Report implied "bridging the gap between the rate of pension of the current
pensioners and the past pensioners".
(Para 19)
However, it needs to be understood that the Koshyari Committee Report is a
report submitted to the Rajya Sabha by the Committee on Petitions. The Report
cannot be enforced as a statement of government policy. It can only be relied upon
to indicate the background of the adoption of OROP. The Report furnishes the
historical background, the reason for the demand, and the view of the
Parliamentary Committee which proposed the adoption of OROP for personnel
belonging to the armed forces. Governmental policy formulated in terms of Article
73 by the Union or Article 162 by the State has to be authoritatively gauged from
the policy documents of the Government, which in present case is the
communication dated 7-11-2015.
(Paras 21 and 26)
The adoption in principle of OROP followed by discussion on the modalities for
implementing it eventually led to communication dated 7-11-2015 of the Ministry
of Defence to the Chiefs of the Army, Air Force and the Naval Staffs. The policy
communication of 7-11-2015 contained decision of the Indian Government to
implement OROP for ex-servicemen w.e.f. 1-7-2014 which envisaged payment of
uniform pension to defence personnel retiring in the same rank with same length of
service regardless of date of retirement which was intended to bridge the gap
between the rates of pension of current and past pensioners at "periodic intervals".
(Paras 30 and 31)
The fallacy in the submission of the petitioners is in argument that the policy
communication dated 7-11-2015 was contrary to the original decision which was
taken by the Union Government to implement OROP. Implicit in the submission of
the petitioners is the premise that the original decision was based on the Koshyari
Committee Report followed by the statement on the floor of the House by the
Minister of Finance (dated 17-2-2014 and 10-7-2014) and the minutes of the
meeting convened by the Defence Minister (dated 26-2-2014). However, an
analysis of the underlying document indicates that while a decision to implement
OROP was taken in principle, the modalities for implementation were yet to be
chalked out. Thus, there was no conscious policy decision on the part of the Union
Government on the modalities for implementing OROP until the communication
dated 7-11-2015 came into being. The communication of 7-11-2015 cannot be
invalidated on the ground that it infringed the "original understanding" of OROP.
(Para 33)
A hierarchy in law exists between statutes and rules - a statutory provision will
have precedence over delegated legislation if the latter conflicts with the former.
Similarly, executive instructions cannot override a statute or rules made
in pursuance of a statute. But in the present case the entire canvas is governed by
a policy. The terms for implementing the policy were specified on 7-11-2015.
Hence, that element of the policy cannot be challenged on the notion that there is
an inflexible notion of OROP couched in an original understanding. OROP is itself a
matter of policy and it was open to the makers of the policy to determine the
terms of implementation. The policy is of course subject to judicial review on
constitutional parameters, which is a distinct issue.
(Para 34)
While the petitioners have not adverted to the doctrine of legitimate
expectations, they have implicitly relied on this principle. The doctrine of legitimate
expectations can be invoked if a representation made by a public body leads an
individual to believe that they would be a recipient of a substantive benefit. A part of
the petitioners' grievance stems from the belief that an assurance made by State
functionaries, the Ministers of the Union Government, did not translate into a
conscious policy decision, which is embodied in the communication dated 7-11-
2015. The expression "automatically" meant that the revision in the rates of
pension would take place on an ongoing basis rather than at periodic intervals, the
question arises whether the doctrine of legitimate expectations can be invoked in
the present case.
(Para 35)
In the instant case, there was no concrete government policy in existence prior
to 7-11-2015. There existed only certain assurances that were made by the
Ministers, or which could be deduced from the minutes of a meeting that was
chaired by the Minister of Defence. These assurances were also to the effect that
OROP has been accepted in principle. The implementation was yet to be worked
out. This eventually took place on 7-11-2015. The communication dated 7-11-
2015 cannot, therefore, be assailed on the ground that it was contrary to the
original intent of the policy formulated by the Union Government though it is
undoubtedly open to be scrutinised on constitutional parameters. Thus, the doctrine
of legitimate expectation was inapplicable.
(Paras 36 to 39)
As to the plea of discrimination, the submission of the petitioners on the
violation of Article 14 of the Constitution is premised essentially on three aspects:
(i) Fixation of the pension as of calendar year 2013 would result in pre-2014
retirees getting less pension of one increment than a soldier retiring after 2014.
(ii) Fixing the pension based on the mean of minimum and maximum pension
of 2013 would result in different pensions for the same ranks and same length
of service depending on whether the personnel retired before or after 31-12-
2013. In effect, a higher ranked soldier would receive lesser pension on
comparison to a lower ranked soldier.
(iii) As a result of the process of equalisation every five years, persons who
have retired prior in point of time would be placed at a disadvantage as their
unequalised pension would be multiplied by a factor of 2.57 while those
who have retired after 1-1-2014 would get the benefit of higher pension which
would be multiplied by 2.57.
(Para 40)
The central limb of the submission of the petitioners is that a revision of OROP
should be automatic. The three documents relied upon by the petitioners, namely,
(i) the Koshyari Committee Report; (ii) the minutes of the meeting chaired by the
Defence Minister on 26-2-2014; and (iii) the communication dated 26-2-2014 to
CADA underscore that "any future enhancement in the rates of pension to be
The surest way t legal research!
automatically passed on to the past pensioners". The expression "to be
automatically passed on" immediately follows upon the words "any future
enhancement in the rates of pension". When read together contextually, it signifies
that the rates of pension would be passed on to past pensioners without any
administrative impediments. The expression "automatically passed on" cannot be
construed as a commitment with reference to any period of time for the
computation of benefits. The manner in which and the period over which revisions
should take place of pensions, salaries and other financial benefits is a pure question
of policy. The decision of the Central Government to revise the pension every five
years cannot be held to violate the precepts underlying Article 14.
(Para 53)
The policy choices which have been made by the Union Government must also
be understood in the context that the estimated budget allocation for defence
pensions is Rs 1,33,825 crores representing 28.39 per cent of the total defence
budget estimate of Rs 4,71,378 crores for 2020-2021. This does not include
budget on salaries which is of the order of 34.89 per cent of the total defence
budget estimates for 2020-2021. Salaries and pensions thus account for nearly 63
per cent of the total defence budget estimates for 2020-2021. In making policy
choices, the Union Government is entitled to take into account priorities towards
modernisation of the armed forces and to modulate the grant of financial benefits
so as to subserve and balance distinct priorities.
(Para 54)
Furthermore, in instant case liberalised pension scheme was made applicable to
all retired army personnel, irrespective of date of retirement. The cut-off date was
only prescribed for determining the base salary used for computing the pension.
While for those who retired on or after 2014, the last drawn salary is used for
computing the pension; for those who retired prior to 2014, the average of the
salary drawn in 2013 is used. This policy only seeks to protect those who retired
before 2014 since the last drawn salary of the prior retirees might be too low and
incomparable to the pay of the 2014 retirees. Moreover, if the maximum salary
drawn is to be used as the base value instead of taking the average salary, an
additional outlay of Rs 1,45,339.34 crores would be incurred. The executive is
therefore, well within its limits to prescribe a policy keeping in view the financial
implications.
(Para 58)

The canvass which is sought to be traversed in these proceedings under Article
32 of the Constitution trenches upon a domain which is reserved for executive
policy. Most questions of policy involve complex considerations of not only technical
and economic factors but also require balancing competing interests for which
democratic reconciliation rather than adjudication is the best remedy. Further, an
increased reliance on Judges to solve matters of pure policy diminishes the role of
other political organs in resolving contested issues of social and political policy,
which require a democratic dialogue. This is not to say that the Supreme Court will
shy away from setting aside policies that impinge on constitutional rights. Rather it
is to provide a clear-eyed role of the function that a court serves in a democracy.
The OROP Policy may only be challenged on the ground that it is manifestly arbitrary
or capricious.

Lon L. Fuller and Kenneth I. Winston:"The Forms and Limits of Adjudication",
Harvard Law Review, Vol. 92, No. 2 (Dec., 1978), pp. 353-409, referred to
The principles governing pensions and cut-off dates under OROP can be
summarised as follows:
(i) All pensioners who hold the same rank may not for all purposes form a
homogeneous class. For example, amongst Sepoys differences do exist in view
of the MACP and ACP schemes. Certain Sepoys receive the pay of the higher
ranked personnel.
(ii) The benefit of a new element in a pensionary scheme can be
prospectively applied. However, the scheme cannot bifurcate a homogeneous
group based on a cut-off date.
305 cannot be interpreted to read the one rank one pension rule into it. It was
only held that the same principle of computation of pensions must be applied
uniformly to a homogeneous class.
(iv) It is not a legal mandate that pensioners who hold the same rank must
be given the same amount of pension. The varying benefits that may be
applicable to certain personnel would also impact the pension payable which
need not be equalised with the rest of the personnel.
(Para 70)
Applying the above principles to the facts of the case, there is no constitutional
infirmity in the OROP principle as defined by the communication dated 7-11-2015
for the following reasons:
(i) The definition of OROP is uniformly applicable to all the pensioners
irrespective of the date of retirement. It is not the case of the petitioners that
the pension is reviewed "automatically" to a class of the pensioners and
"periodically" to another class of the pensioners.
(ii) The cut-off date is used only for the purpose of determining the base
salary for the calculation of pension. While for those who retired after 2014, the
last drawn salary is used to calculate pension, for those who retired prior to
2013, the average salary drawn in 2013 is used. Since the uniform application of
the last drawn salary for the purpose of calculating pension would put the prior
retirees at a disadvantage, the Union Government has taken
a policy decision to enhance the base salary for the calculation of pension. Such a
decision lies within the ambit of policy choices.
(iii) While no legal or constitutional mandate of OROP can be read into the
pension payable to officers of the same rank retiring before and after 1-7-2014,
either due to MACP or the different base salary used for the calculation of
pension cannot be held arbitrary.
(Para 71)
In terms of the communication dated 7-11-2015, the benefit of OROP was to
be effected from 1-7-2014. Para 3(v) of the communication states that "in future,
the pension would be re-fixed every five years". Such an exercise has remained to
be carried out after the expiry of five years possibly because of the pendency of the
present proceedings. Hence, directed that in terms of the communication dated 7-
11-2015, a re-fixation exercise shall be carried out from 1-7-2019, upon the expiry
of five years. Arrears payable to all eligible pensioners of the armed forces shall be
computed and paid over accordingly within a period of three months.

A. Factual background
2. The petition under Article 32 of the Constitution addresses a
challenge to the manner in which the "One Rank One
Pension" ("OROP") policy for ex-servicement of defence forces has been
implemented by the first respondent (also referred as "the Union
Government") through a Letter dated 7-11-2015 issued to the Chiefs of
three defence forces. The Letter defines OROP as the payment of
uniform pension to armed services personnel retiring in the same rank
with the same length of service, irrespective of the date of retirement.
OROP, in terms of the Letter, aims to bridge the gap between the rate
of pension of current and past pensioners at periodic intervals. The
petitioners contend that in the course of implementation, the principle
of OROP has been replaced by "one rank multiple pensions" for persons
with the same length of service. The petitioners contend that the initial
definition of OROP was altered by the first respondent and, instead of
an automatic revision of the rates of pension, the revision now would
take place at periodic intervals. The petitioners submit
that the deviation from the principle of automatic revision of rates of
pension, where any future enhancement to the rates of pension are
automatically passed on to the past pensioners, is arbitrary and
unconstitutional under Articles 14 and 21 of the Constitution.
3. The salient facts giving rise to the proceedings need to be stated.
The demand for OROP by ex-servicement of the defence forces was
initially examined by Parliament in 2010-11. On 19-12-2011, the Rajya
Sabha Committee on Petitions ("Koshyari Committee") presented its
142nd Report on the Petition Praying for Grant of OROP to Armed
Forces Personnel ("Koshyari Committee Report"). The Committee
recommended the implementation of OROP. The Committee defined
OROP as a uniform pension to be paid to armed forces personnel
retiring in the same rank with the same length of service, irrespective
of their date of retirement, where any future enhancements in the rates
of pension were to be automatically passed on to the past pensioners.
The Committee noted that OROP was being implemented till 1973 when
the Third Central Pay Commission took a decision to revoke it.
4. The relevant observations/recommendations of the Koshyari
Committee are extracted below:
"11. The Committee takes note of the fact that a sum of Rs 1300
crores is the total financial liability for the year 2011-12 in case
OROP is implemented fully for all the defence personnel in the
country across the board. The Committee is informed that out of this
Rs 1065 crores would go to retirees belonging to Post Below Officer
Ranks (PBOR) while the Commissioned Officers would be getting the
remaining i.e. Rs 235 crores. The Committee feels that Rs 1300
crores is not a very big amount for a country of our size and
economy for meeting the long pending demand of the armed forces
of the country. The Committee understands that this Rs 1300 crores
is the expenditure for one year which might increase at the rate of
10 per cent annually. Even if it is so, the Committee does not
consider this amount to be high, keeping in view the objective for
which it would be spent. Needless for the Committee to point out
here that our defence personnel were getting their pension and
family pension on an entirely different criteria before the Third
Central Pay Commission came into force. Till the recommendations of
the Third Central Pay Commission were implemented for the defence
personnel of the country, they were satisfied and happy with
dispensation meant for their pension/family pension.
*
*
*
11.4.
the Committee feels that the decision of the Government
to bring our defence personnel on the pattern of the civilians with
regard to their pay, pension, etc. (from Third Central Pay
Commission onwards) is not a considered decision which has caused
hardship to the defence personnel and has given birth to their
demand for OROP. The Committee understands that before the Third
Central Pay Commission, the defence personnel were getting their
pay/pension on the basis of a separate criteria
unconnected with the criteria devised for the civilian workforce. That
criteria acknowledged and covered the concept of OROP which has been
given up after the Third Central Pay Commission.
11.5. The Committee is not convinced with the hurdles projected
by the Ministry of Defence (Department of Ex-Servicemen Welfare)
in implementing of OROP for defence personnel. They have
categorised the hurdles into administrative, legal and financial. The
financial aspect has already been dealt with by the Committee. So
far as the administrative angle is concerned, the Committee is given
to understand that all the existing pensioners/family pensioners are
still drawing their pension/family pension based upon the lawfully
determined pension/family pension. In that case, revision of their
pension/family pension, prospectively, as a one-time measure should
not pose any administrative hurdle. So far as the legal aspect is
concerned, the Committee is not convinced by the argument put
forth against the implementation of OROP because the
pension/family pension is based upon the service rendered by
personnel while in service and comparison of services rendered
during two sets of periods does not seem to be of much relevance. If
seen from a strict angle, in each set of periods, the army officer
performed the duties attached to his post and it may not be proper
to infer that the officers who served at a later period performed more
compared to the officers of earlier period. On the contrary, facts tilt
towards treating past pensioners/family pensioners on a par with the
more recent ones."
5. On 17-2-2014, the Finance Minister announced in his Budget
Speech that the Union Government had in principle accepted OROP and
it would be implemented prospectively from Financial Year 2014-15.
The Finance Minister stated that an amount of Rs 500 crores has been
transferred to the Defence Pension Account to meet the budgetary
expense. On 26-2-2014, the Defence Minister chaired a meeting to
discuss the implementation of OROP. The Defence Secretary, the
Secretary to the Department of Ex-Servicemen Welfare, the Controller
General of Defence Accounts ("CGDA"), the three Vice-Chiefs of Staff,
and senior officers of the Service Headquarters along with the Joint
Secretaries concerned attended the meeting. The minutes of the
meeting refer to OROP as a uniform pension to be paid to armed forces
personnel that are retiring in the same rank with the same length of
service, irrespective of the date of retirement, where any future
enhancements in the rates of pension are to be automatically passed on
to the past pensioners. The fourth respondent, CGDA, was directed to
take necessary steps to give effect to the decision of implementing
OROP in consultation with the three defence forces, and the first and
second respondents.
6. By its Letter dated 26-2-2014 the first respondent directed CGDA
to work out the modalities of executing OROP. However, OROP was not
implemented at the time. On 10-7-2014 in his Budget Speech for the
year 2014-2015, the Finance Minister reaffirmed the Union
Government's commitment to implement OROP and a further sum of Rs
1000 crores was set
apart to meet the requirement. In a written reply to a Member of
Parliament on 2-12-2014, the Minister of State for Defence stated that
OROP implies that a uniform pension is paid to retired servicemen
having the same rank with the same length of service, irrespective of
the date of retirement, with any future enhancement in the rates being
passed on to the past pensioners automatically.
7. The above sequence of events has been emphasised by the
petitioners to highlight that OROP always entailed an automatic revision
of the rates of pension to bridge the gap in the pension being received
by past and current pensioners. However, according to the petitioners,
a Letter dated 7-11-2015 of the Joint Secretary of the first respondent
to the Chiefs of three defence forces introduced a revised definition of
OROP, where the revision between the past and current rates of pension
was to take place at periodic intervals. Besides stating that OROP would
take effect from 1-7-2014, the letter also highlighted the salient
features of OROP:
"3. Salient features of the OROP are as follows:
(i) To begin with, pension of the past pensioners would be re-
fixed on the basis of pension of retirees of calendar year 2013 and
the benefit will be effective with effect from 1-7-2014.
(ii) Pension will be re-fixed for all pensioners on the basis of
the average of minimum and maximum pension of personnel
retired in 2013 in the same rank and with the same length of
service.
(iii) Pension for those drawing above the average shall be
protected.
(iv) Arrears will be paid in four equal half-yearly instalments.
However, all the family pensioners including those in receipt of
Special/Liberalised family pension and Gallantry award winner
shall be paid arrears in one instalment.
(v) In future, the pension would be re-fixed every 5 years."
8. The above definition of OROP was also adopted by the first
respondent while implementing OROP by its Notification dated 14-11-
2015. The rates of pension were now to be revised every five years. The
notification also constituted a Committee headed by Justice L.
Narasimha Reddy to examine and make recommendations on the terms
of reference received by the Union Government on measures to remove
anomalies that may arise in the implementation of the Letter dated 7-
11-2015.
9. By its Letter dated 25-1-2016 to the Defence Minister the first
petitioner objected to the revision of the definition of OROP highlighting
that the deviation from the automatic revision of rates of pension to a
revision at periodic intervals changed the accepted meaning of OROP. It
was submitted that the revised definition would deprive the past
pensioners of equal monetary benefits, which militated against the
principle of OROP. The letter urged that the Committee headed by
Justice L. Narasimha Reddy would be "inapt" in making
recommendations on the issue of OROP since the terms of reference
took into account the revised definition of OROP. The letter urged the
Defence Minister to revert to the original definition of OROP where the
pension of past pensioners would be automatically revised pursuant to
any future
enhancements. The first petitioner also wrote to Justice L. Narasimha
Reddy on 25-3-2016 highlighting the anomalies that will result from
the implementation of the revised definition of OROP.
10. Meanwhile, the first respondent issued a letter to the Chiefs of
the three defence forces on 3-2-2016 regarding the implementation of
OROP. On 29-10-2016, the first respondent issued a letter to the Chiefs
of the three defence forces revising the pension of pre-2016 defence
forces' pensioners and family pensioners. The existing pension was to
be revised upwards by implementing the basic pension drawn on 31-12
-2015 by a multiplication factor of 2.57. The petitioners have
highlighted that owing to the periodic revision of the pension rate
according to the revised definition, the pension of many ex-servicement
would not be updated to 31-12-2015 level.
11. A post facto approval of the Union Cabinet for implementation of
OROP was received on 6-4-2016 and was conveyed by the Cabinet
Secretariat on 7-4-2016. The proposal, which was approved by the
Union Cabinet is as follows:
"9.1. Ex post facto approval of the Cabinet is solicited for
implementation of One Rank One Pension as under.
9.1.1. The benefit will be given with effect from 1-7-2014.
9.1.2. Pension will be re-fixed for pre 1-7-2014 pensioners retiring
in the same rank and with the same length of service as the average
minimum and maximum pension drawn by the retirees in the year
2013. Those drawing pensions above the average will be protected.
9.1.3. The benefit would also be extended to family pensioners
including war widows and disabled pensioners.
9.1.4. Personnel who opt to get discharged henceforth on their
own request under Rule 13(3)1(i)(b), Rule 13(3)1(iv) or Rule 16-B
of the Army Rules, 1954 or equivalent Navy or Air Force Rules will
not be entitled to the benefits of OROP. It will be effective
prospectively.
9.1.5. Arrears will be paid in four half-yearly instalments.
However, all the family pensioners including those in receipt of
Special/Liberalised family pension and Gallantry award winners shall
be paid arrears in one instalment.
9.1.6. In future, the pension would be re-fixed every 5 years.
9.1.7. Constitution of Judicial Committee headed by Justice L.
Narasimha Reddy, Retd. Chief Justice of the Patna High Court on 14-
12-2015 which will give its report in six months on references made
by the Government of India."
12. Aggrieved by what the petitioners contend is a revision in the
definition of OROP, the petition under Article 32 was instituted before
this Court on 9-6-2016. On 1-5-20191, this Court took note of the
anomalies which were highlighted on behalf of the petitioners : (Indian
"2. 'Fixation of pension as per calendar year 2013 instead of FY
2014 : Fixation of pension as per calendar year 2013 would result in
past
retirees (pre 2014) getting less pension of one increment than the
soldier retiring after 2014.
Fixation of pension as mean of Min and Max pension : Fixing
pension as mean of Min and Max pension of 2013 would result in
different pensions for the same ranks and same length of service and
the past retiree would get 1.5 increment lesser on account of such
fixation.
For example, if 8(i) and (ii) are implemented, two soldiers who
have served for same length of years, holding the same rank will
draw different pension. A Sepoy (Group Y) who retired prior to 31-12
-2013 will get Rs 6665 p.m. and another Sepoy (Group Y) who
retired on and after 1-1-2014 would get Rs 7605 p.m. Further, on
account of such implementation, a higher rank Naik soldier who
retired before 31-12-2013 would draw a lesser pension of Rs 7170
p.m., than a junior rank Sepoy who retired after 1-1-2014 as his
pension would be Rs 7605. This fact is illustrated by a tabular chart
which is enclosed. (See p. 1, CC).
Therefore, implementation of this new definition of OROP defeats
the very principle of OPOP by creating a class within a class of the
same officers, which in practice tantamounts to one rank different
pensions. This is also contrary to the judgment by this Hon'ble Court
in Union of India V. SPS Vains2.
Another fallacy in the new definition of OROP which detracts from
the principle of OROP is:
(iii) Pension equalisation every five years.
It is submitted that pension equalisation every five years would
result in the grave disadvantage to the past retirees.'' "
13. This Court directed the first respondent to scrutinise the
grievances raised by the petitioners. Pursuant to the order, the first
respondent filed an affidavit on 5-12-2019 submitting that after
extensive consultations with experts and ex-servicemen, the Union
Government decided that it is practical and feasible to revise the
pension under OROP every five years. The average of the minimum and
maximum pension in calendar year 2013 was decided to be taken as
the revised pension of all pensioners retiring in the same rank and with
the same length of service. At the same time, the first respondent
chose to protect the pensioners who were drawing pension above the
average. Thus, it was submitted, that the implementation of OROP has
benefitted the past pensioners, though the amount of financial benefit
varies. It was urged on behalf of the first respondent that revising the
rate of pension every year would cause administrative difficulty and is
impracticable to implement.
14. Since the grievance of the petitioners remained unaddressed, it
falls on this Court to adjudicate upon whether the revision of the
definition of OROP and its implementation in the present form, is
arbitrary and violative of Articles 14 and 21 of the Constitution. Before
we analyse the rival contentions, we advert to the submissions of the
counsel.
B. Submissions of Counsel
15. Mr Huzefa Ahmadi, Senior Counsel, appeared for the petitioners.
The following submissions have been made on behalf of the petitioners
during the course of the proceedings:
15.1. The Letter issued by the Joint Secretary of the first respondent
to the Chief of Air Staff on 7-11-2015 arbitrarily alters the definition of
OROP ("new definition") by bridging the gap between the rates of
pension of the current and the past pensioners at "periodic intervals"
and not "automatically". This definition is contrary to the definition
arrived at in the meeting held on 26-2-2014 and the subsequent
executive order issued on the same day.
15.2. The implementation of the scheme with the new definition
would lead to a situation where the pension drawn bv an ex-serviceman
who retired on an earlier date would be less than the pension drawn by
an ex-serviceman who retired in 2014, until such time that a "periodic"
review is conducted to correct the anomaly.
15.3. The new definition creates a class within a class where ex-
servicemen who retired with the same rank and same length of service
would receive different pensions. In Union of India V. SPS Vains this
2
Court has held that the creation of a class within a class is
unconstitutional.
15.4. Even if the differential pay is rectified by a periodic review, it
would cause injustice.
15.5. The effective date of implementation of OROP was already
fixed as -4-2014 and this date has been arbitrarily re-fixed to 1-7- -
2014 by the Letter issued by the first respondent on 7-11-2015.
15.6. According to the Letter dated 7-11-2015, the pension of the
personnel retiring on or after 1-4-2014 will be fixed based on the last
pay drawn on retirement. However, the pension of soldiers who retired
earlier than 2013 would be fixed on the basis of the pension of the
retirees of the calendar year 2013. This would lead to a situation of one
rank different pension:

15.7. The pension of the past pensioners is further lowered by the re
-fixation of pension based on the average of the minimum and
maximum pension of personnel retiring in the calendar year 2013, as
compared to personnel retiring on or after 1-4-2014. In some cases, a
past pensioner who retired before 2014 receives pension lower than
personnel of a lower rank retiring on or after 2014. For instance, if the
new definition is followed then a Sepoy who retired prior to 31-12-2013
will get a pension of Rs 6665 per month while another Sepoy who
retired on or after 1-1-2014 would get a pension of Rs 7605 per month.

15.8. The difference in the pension as provided in the chart is not
due to the Modified Assured Career Progression ("MACP"). Even
according to the new definition, all personnel with the same rank and
same length of service must receive the same pension.
15.9. The Notification issued on 14-12-2015 adheres to the arbitrary
definition of OROP as provided by the Letter issued on 7-11-2015. The
terms of reference of the Committee appointed under the notification
are also restricted to the arbitrary new definition of OROP. The Letter
issued by the first respondent to the Chief of Army Staff, the Chief of
Naval Staff, and the Chief of Air Staff on 3-2-2016 also defined OROP in
new and arbitrary terms.
15.10. As noted by the Koshyari Committee, after the Sixth Central
Pay Commission, officers from the grade of Lt. Colonel and above fall
within one pay band of Rs 37,400 to Rs 67,000. Therefore, defence
retirees before 2014 would get pension with reference to the minimum
of the pay bracket, irrespective of the fact that they held higher posts
such as Major General and Lt. General.
15.11. All Havildars were granted the honorary rank of Naib
Subedar. They must thus be given the pension of Naib Subedar.
15.12. All personnel who retired as Major after thirteen years of
service as Commissioned Officers should be given the pension of Lt.
Colonel since Commissioned Officers now automatically become Lt.
Colonels after thirteen years of service.
15.13. All veterans who retired before 2004 as Lt. Colonel should be
given the pension of Colonel since all Commissioned Officers now
automatically retire as Colonel.
15.14. While the Government defines OROP as a "uniform pension to
be paid to the defence personnel retiring in the same rank, with the
same length of service regardless of the date of retirement", it creates a
class within a class based on the date of retirement.
15.15. The decision to define OROP in narrow terms is an executive
act which can be judicially reviewed and is not a policy decision.
15.16. According to the Letter of the Union Government dated 7-11-
2015, the pension of past pensioners would be fixed one-and-a-half
year's behind even if equalisation is done once in five years.
15.17. Under the Seventh Pay Commission, the basic pension of all
pensioners is to be arrived at by multiplying basic pension as on 31-12-
2015 by a factor of 2.57. Since the basic pension of those who retired
before 31-12-2013-14 has not been updated to 31-12-2015 (that is, Rs
7605 per month) but has only been fixed based on the mean of the
2013 pension, that is Rs 6665 per month, a past pensioner will get Rs
2415 less than an officer with the same rank and same length of
service but who retired later.
15.18. The Union Government has stated that after the Seventh Pay
Commission, the basic pension of personnel in the Colonel and
Brigadier ranks
will be arrived at by increasing the multiplication factor from 2.57 to
2.67. However, this increase has been denied to the past pensioners on
the ground that the benefit will only be given in 2019 after the periodic
equalisation as per the new definition.
15.19. The ex-servicement received the benefit of OROP till the Third
Central Pay Commission. Subsequently, it was recommended that the
pension of ex-servicement be reduced and to compensate them for such
reduction, they were to be absorbed in paramilitary forces, police forces
or public sector organisations. However, though the pension was
reduced, the recommendation relating to their absorption was not
implemented. The army personnel then demanded that OROP must be
implemented.
15.20. The reliance placed by the respondents on D.S. Nakara V.
Union of IndiaÂ³ is incorrect since it only deals with the general law
applicable to civil servants. The decision in SPS Vains deals with the
special law applicable to ex-servicemen of the defence forces.
15.21. The one-man Committee headed by Justice L. Narasimha
Reddy submitted its Report to the Union Government on 26-12-2016.
Even after two years, the Government is still "studying" the Report and
has not yet released the Report.
15.22. If the respondents can calculate the enhancement of pension
for every five years, there is no reason that it cannot be done every
year.
15.23. The rule of reduction in the pension if the service of the
armed personnel is less than twenty-six years was introduced in 1973.
If a soldier has served for less than twenty-six years then his pension
would be reduced pro rata of X (number of years served) % 26. The
Government has not updated the basic pay of soldiers and did not bring
it on a par with 31-12-2015 pay before multiplying it with the factor of
2.57. At the same time, the pension was altered from being rank based
to 50% of the last drawn pay. This resulted in double loss to ex-
servicemen. This Court has also struck down the rule of reducing
pension if an employee has served less than twenty-six years.
15.24. While the respondents have submitted that an amount of Rs
10,795 crores has been paid as arrears for OROP in two years, it only
amounts to an average increase of Rs 2131 per month per soldier. The
Union Government is spending a higher amount of funds for Central
Government employees and pensioners.
15.25. The Union Government has spent Rs 32,385 crores for OROP
in six years which is less than its spending of Rs 27,800 crores per year
for the scheme of Non-Functional Upgradation. The Union Government
consistently has been spending less on the armed forces. For instance,
the "High Altitude Siachen Allowance" for Army personnel is Rs 31,500,
while it is Rs 50,000 to 70,000 for all Central Cadre for serving in "hard
areas" like Shillong.
15.26. MACP Scheme should be given to all past retirees to comply
with the judgment of this Court in SPS Vains2. Even if MACP has been
given to the 2013 retirees, the comparison made in the chart still holds
correct.
15.27. While the Union Government states that the benefit of OROP
is to be given to "past retirees", it has created a confusion by stating
that the scheme must be given prospective effect.
15.28. The MACP Scheme came into effect from 1-1-2016.
Therefore, the figure of Rs 6665 referring to the pension receivable by a
Sepoy should include the benefits of the MACP Scheme.
16. We have heard Mr Venkataramanan, the learned Additional
Solicitor General of India, for the respondents. The respondents have
made the following submissions during the course of the proceedings:
16.1. The budget for pension has been increased after the
implementation of OROP with effect from 1-7-2014. The disbursement
of arrears with respect to OROP is approximately Rs 10,795.04 crores.
The yearly recurring expenditure on account of OROP is Rs 7123.38
crores. For the six years from 1-7-2014, the total recurring expenditure
is approximately Rs 42,740.28 crores.
16.2. OROP seeks to bridge the gap by taking the maximum and
minimum pension within the rank of pensioners holding the same rank
and same length of service to determine the average. Those who are
below the average pension are brought to the average and those who
are drawing a higher pension are protected.
16.3. The OROP Scheme has been implemented prospectively with
effect from 1-7-2014. The benefits arising out of the scheme are to be
paid after 1-7-2014 to those who retired prior to 1-7-2014.
16.4. The OROP Scheme envisages revision of pension once in five
years, unlike civilian pension schemes which are revised once in ten
years. The plea of the petitioners to provide "automatic" adjustment
cannot be acceded to as it is impossible to implement it.
16.5. It is a settled principle of law that minutes, statements and
inter-ministerial discussions with the Ministry and within the Ministry
do not have the force of law. Therefore the reference made by the
petitioners to the minutes of the meeting to argue that the definition of
OROP has been altered is unsustainable.
16.6. The scheme/policy can be challenged on the grounds of
arbitrariness but a demand to substitute the policy cannot be made.
16.7. The disparity alleged by the petitioners in the pensions of the
defence personnel with the same rank and same length of service has
been wrongly depicted on account of the OROP Scheme. An artificial
disparity has been shown by equating different classes of pensioners.
16.8. In Figure 1 of the chart produced by the petitioners, they have
compared the pension payable to a Sepoy with 15 years of service
under the
OROP Scheme and the pension of a Sepoy who retired before 2014
(before the application of OROP) after fifteen years of service who is
drawing pay in the rank of Naik due to the MACP Scheme introduced
pursuant to Circular No. 555 dated 4-2-2016.
16.9. The pension figure of Rs 6665 is arrived at by taking the
average pension of the maximum and minimum pension of 2013.
However, the figure of Rs 7605 is calculated on the basis of 50% of the
last pay drawn before retirement.
16.10. Under the MACP Scheme, a Sepoy who was originally getting
Rs 2000 as grade pay would after eight years of service receive a next
grade pay of Rs 2400. The grade pay of Rs 2400 corresponds to the
grade pay of Naik. Similarly after sixteen years of service, he would
receive the higher grade pay of Rs 2800, which corresponds to the
grade pay of Havildar.
16.11. Similarly, the disparity shown in Figure 2 by the petitioners
is due to the implementation of the MACP Scheme rather than OROP.
Figure 3 which pertains to the rank of Group Captain quotes the
pension amount of Group Captain Daniel Victor who retired on 28-2-
2015. The OROP Scheme is not applicable to Group Captain Victor.
16.12. The comparison drawn by the petitioners is a comparison
between non-comparables. The pension calculated based on the
average pension in 2013 cannot be compared with the actual pension
received based on the pension rules.
16.13. The MACP regime warranted a service of 6, 16 and 24 years
of service by the Sepoy for grouping with the rank of Naik, Havildar and
Naib Subedar. On the other hand, under the earlier Assured Career
Progression ("ACP") regime, the required service is of 10, 20 and 30
years.
16.14. For computation of OROP, the Union Government has taken
MACP as the base and has applied it across the board to all retirees
having the same length of service. OROP is not calculated based on
MACP and ACP regime. No such differentiation is made.
16.15. An executive decision of the Union Government on the OROP
can only be challenged on legal principles. However, the petitioners are
seeking the most beneficial interpretation of OROP to be implemented.
It cannot be contended that the most beneficial interpretation of OROP
is the only "true" interpretation and that it must be implemented as a
right.
16.16. In SPS Vains2, this Court held that pre and post 1996 retired
Major Generals must be treated on a par to remove an anomaly in the
pension of pre-1996 retired Major Generals. The principle in that case
was about the removal of anomaly between the ranks of Major General
and Brigadier which had arisen due to the implementation of the Fifth
and the Sixth Central Pay Commissions.
16.17. In Indian Ex-Services League V. Union of India4 4 this Court
has held that unless the claim of OROP can be treated to be flowing
from the reliefs provided in NakaraÂ³, the reliefs claimed cannot be
granted. It was also observed that the decision in NakaraÂ³ cannot be
enlarged to cover within it all the claims made by the pension retirees
since the purpose of computation of the pension is different. The
decisions in K.L. Rathee V. Union of India5 and Suchet Singh Yadav V.
Union of India6 support this submission.
16.18. The Committee headed by Justice L. Narasimha Reddy
submitted its Report to the Union Government. The Internal Committee
is examining the feasibility of the recommendations.
16.19. The recommendations of the Koshyari Committee were not
accepted by the Union Government and are thus not binding upon it.
The recommendations of the Committee cannot be termed as the
decision of the Union Government.
16.20. Since the Sixth Pay Commission, the length of service is no
longer a criterion for calculating pension. The pension is now
determined by 50% of the last pay drawn. However, due to demands,
OROP rates have been prepared based on the average pension of
retirees in 2013.
16.21. It is not feasible to undertake an automatic revision. Though
the Government has accepted the principle of uniformity, it is not
unreasonable to define periodicity for ensuring uniformity.
16.22. The argument that OROP should be approved with effect from
1-4-2014 because it was announced in the Budget of 2014 is
erroneous. The scheme was proposed by the Ministry of Defence
through the Letters dated 7-11-2015 and 3-2-2016.
16.23. The pension of OROP beneficiaries who retired before 1-7-
2014 was revised by the multiplication factor of 2.57 according to the
recommendations of the Seventh Central Pay Commission. However,
those who retired after 1-1-2016 received the benefit of only revision in
emoluments in terms of the recommendations of the Seventh Central
Pay Commission.
16.24. The statement made by the Finance Minister on 17-2-2014
was not based on the decision of the Union Cabinet. The Cabinet
Secretariat conveyed the approval of the Prime Minister to the OROP
Scheme on 7-11-2015. The Ministry of Defence communicated this
policy by a Notification dated 7-11-2015. A post facto approval was
conveyed by the Union Cabinet on 6-4-2016.
16.25. One of the qualifying conditions for the OROP Scheme is that
the personnel must have the "same length of service". One who had not
put in the same length of service is not eligible for an MACP. The total
financial outflow
that is likely to be incurred by the Union Government for non-MACP to
be linked with MACP personnel would be in the range of Rs 42,776.38
crores.
16.26. The expression "automatically" used in the Koshyari
Committee Report, the minutes of the meeting held on 26-2-2014 and
the executive order dated 26-2-2014 defining the OROP Scheme follow
the expression "in the rates of pension to be automatically passed on to
the past pensioners". It must, thus, be read as meaning that the rates
of pension will be passed to the past pensioners without any difficulties.
The phrase "automatically" does not mean the time period.
C. Analysis
17. Though, a significant number of factual and detailed issues were
raised in the course of the pleadings. Mr Huzefa Ahmadi, learned Senior
Counsel appearing on behalf of the petitioners brought focus upon and
urged the following specific submissions during the course of the
hearing:
17.1. The Union Government took an executive decision to
implement OROP as understood by the Koshyari Committee. This is
evidenced by:
(a) The statement of the Minister of Finance in the Lok Sabha on
17-2-2014;
(b) The decision taken on 26-2-2014 in the meeting convened by
the Union Minister for Defence;
(c) The Letter dated 26-2-2014 of the Union Government to the
CGDA;
(d) The Budget speech of the Minister of Finance on 10-7-2014;
and
(e) The reply of 2-12-2014 of the Minister of State for Finance to
the Member of Parliament.
17.2. The essential elements underlying the concept of OROP are:
(a) Those retiring from the same rank with the same length of
service must receive the same pension irrespective of the date of
retirement;
(b) Future enhancements of pension must be automatically
passed on to past pensioners; and
(c) Bridging of the gap between the rate of pension of present and
past pensioners.
17.3. In substitution of the above principle underlying OROP, the
communication dated 7-11-2015 of the Ministry of Defence modified
the executive decision by stipulating that:
(i) The pension of past pensioners would be refixed on the basis of
the pension of the retirees of calendar year 2013, with the benefit
being effective from 1-7-2014;
(ii) Pension is to be revisited for all pensioners on the basis of the
average of the minimum and maximum pension of persons who
retired in 2013 in the same rank and with the same length of
service;
(iii) In the future pension would be revisited every five years and
not automatically; and
(iv) Hence, the actual decision which was taken on 7-11-2015
deviates from the principle of equality which OROP adopts.
18. The submissions which have been urged by the pensioners are
sought to be buttressed by referring to the charts set out in the earlier
part of this judgment and marked as Figures 1, 2 and 3 by which an
attempt has been made to show the disparity in the pension payable to
persons of the same rank with the same length of service, based on the
date of retirement.
C.1. Concept and genesis of OROP
19. The adoption of OROP as a guiding statement of policy on 7-11-
2015 was preceded by discussions both within and outside Parliament.
The Koshyari Committee submitted its Report on 10-12-2011. The
Committee formulated an understanding of the concept of OROP.
According to the Report of the Committee, OROP implies that a
"uniform pension be paid to the armed forces personnel retiring in the
same rank with the same length of service irrespective of their date of
retirement and any future enhancements in the rate of pension to be
automatically passed on to the past pensioners". The concept,
according to the Report implied "bridging the gap between the rate of
pension of the current pensioners and the past pensioners". This
understanding of the concept of OROP in the Koshyari Committee
Report was based on the norm that hierarchy in the armed forces
comprises of two elements, namely, rank and length of service. Ranks
are conferred by the President and signify command, control and
responsibility. Ranks are allowed to be retained even after retirement.
Hence OROP, according to the Koshyari Committee postulates that two
personnel from the armed forces in the same rank and with the equal
length of service should get the same pension irrespective of their
dates of retirement and any future enhancement in the rates of pension
must be automatically passed on to past pensioners.
20. While proposing the adoption of OROP in principle, the Koshyari
Committee highlighted that:
(i) OROP was in vogue till 1973 when the Third Central Pay
Commission decided otherwise.
(ii) Unlike civilian employees who retire by age, armed forces
personnel retire by rank.
(iii) The conditions of service of personnel from the armed forces
are harsher than those of civilian employees and armed forces
personnel cannot be equated with civilian employees of the
Government.
21. Now it needs to be understood that the Koshyari Committee
Report is a report submitted to the Rajya Sabha by the Committee on
Petitions. The Report cannot be enforced as a statement of government
policy. In Kalpana Mehta V. Union of India Â², a Constitution Bench of this
Court dealt, on the reference under Article 145(3), with two issues,
"9. `73.1. (i) Whether in a litigation filed before this Court either
under Article 32 or Article 136 of the Constitution of India, the Court
can refer to and place reliance upon the Report of the Parliamentary
Standing Committee?
73.2. (ii) Whether such a report can be looked at for the purpose
of reference and, if so, can there be restrictions for the purpose of
reference regard being had to the concept of parliamentary privilege
and the delicate balance between the constitutional institutions that
Articles 105, 121 and 122 of the Constitution conceive?' *"
22. Dipak Misra, C.J. (speaking for himself and A.M. Khanwilkar, J.)
"Q. Conclusions
*
*
*
159.1. Parliamentary Standing Committee Report can be taken
aid of for the purpose of interpretation of a statutory provision
wherever it is so necessary and also it can be taken note of as
existence of a historical fact.
*
*
*
159.3. In a litigation filed either under Article 32 or Article 136 of
the Constitution of India, this Court can take on record the Report of
the Parliamentary Standing Committee. However, the report cannot
be impugned or challenged in a court of law.
159.4. Where the fact is contentious, the petitioner can always
collect the facts from many a source and produce such facts by way
of affidavits, and the Court can render its verdict by way of
independent adjudication.
159.5. The Parliamentary Standing Committee Report being in the
public domain can invite fair comments and criticism from the
citizens as in such a situation, the citizens do not really comment
upon any Member of Parliament to invite the hazard of violation of
parliamentary privilege."
23. One of us (D.Y. Chandrachud, J.) speaking for himself and Dr
A.K. Sikri, J. held that a Report of a Parliamentary Committee may have
a bearing upon diverse perspectives some of which were formulated
"259.1. The Report of a Parliamentary Committee may contain a
statement of position by Government on matters of policy;
259.2. The report may allude to statements made by persons who
have deposed before the Committee;
259.3. The report may contain inferences of fact including on the
performance of Government in implementing policies and legislation;
259.4. The report may contain findings of misdemeanour
implicating a breach of duty by public officials or private individuals
or an evasion of law; or
259.5. The report may shed light on the purpose of a law, the
social problem which the legislature had in view and the manner in
which it was sought to be remedied."
129-30, para 264)
"264.
Committees
of
Parliament
attached
to
ministries/departments of the Government perform the function of
holding the Government accountable to implement its policies and
its duties under legislation. The performance of governmental
agencies may form the subject-matter of such a report. In other
cases, the deficiencies of the legislative framework in remedying
social wrongs may be the subject of an evaluation by a Parliamentary
Committee. The work of a Parliamentary Committee may traverse
the area of social welfare either in terms of the extent to which
existing legislation is being effectively implemented or in
highlighting the lacunae in its framework. There is no reason in
principle why the wide jurisdiction of the High Courts under Article
226 or of this Court under Article 32 should be exercised in a manner
oblivious to the enormous work which is carried out by Parliamentary
Committees in the field. The work of the committee is to secure
alacrity on the part of the Government in alleviating deprivations of
social justice and in securing efficient and accountable governance.
When courts enter upon issues of public interest and adjudicate
upon them, they do not discharge a function which is adversarial.
The constitutional function of adjudication in matters of public
interest is in step with the role of Parliamentary Committees which is
to secure accountability, transparency and responsiveness in the
Government. In such areas, the doctrine of separation does not
militate against the court relying upon the Report of a Parliamentary
Committee. The court does not adjudge the validity of the report nor
for that matter does it embark upon a scrutiny into its correctness.
There is a functional complementarity between the purpose of the
investigation by the Parliamentary Committee and the adjudication
by the court. To deprive the court of the valuable insight of a
Parliamentary Committee would amount to excluding an important
source of information from the purview of the court. To do so on the
supposed hypothesis that it would amount to a breach of
parliamentary privilege would be to miss the wood for the trees.
Once the Report of the Parliamentary Committee has been published
it lies in the public domain. Once Parliament has placed it in the
public domain, there is an irony about the executive relying on
parliamentary privilege. There is no reason or justification to exclude
it from the purview of the material to which the court seeks recourse
to understand the problem with which it is required to deal. The
court must look at the report with a robust commonsense, conscious
of the fact that it is not called upon to determine the validity of the
report which constitutes advice tendered to Parliament. The extent to
which the court would rely upon a report must necessarily vary from
case to case and no absolute rule can be laid down in that regard."
25. In a concurring judgment, Ashok Bhushan, J. observed :
"449.7. Both the parties have not disputed that parliamentary
reports can be used for the purposes of legislative history of a
statute as well as for considering the statement made by a minister.
When there is no breach of privilege in considering the parliamentary
materials and reports of the Committee by the Court for the above
two purposes, we fail to see any valid reason for not accepting the
submission of the petitioner that courts are not debarred from
accepting the parliamentary materials and reports, on record, before
it, provided the court does not proceed to permit the parties to
question and impeach the reports."
26. The Koshyari Committee Report can be relied upon to indicate
the background of the adoption of OROP. The Report furnishes the
historical background, the reason for the demand, and the view of the
Parliamentary Committee which proposed the adoption of OROP for
personnel belonging to the armed forces. Beyond this, the Koshyari
Committee Report cannot be construed as embodying a statement of
governmental policy. Governmental policy formulated in terms of Article
73 by the Union or Article 162 by the State has to be authoritatively
gauged from the policy documents of the Government, which in present
case is the communication dated 7-11-2015. Prior to it, on 17-2-2014,
a statement was made by the Union Minister of Finance in the Lok
Sabha while presenting the interim budget for 2014-15 stating that the
Government had accepted the principle of OROP for the defence forces
and that the decision would be implemented from Financial Year 2014-
15. The statement of the Union Minister of Finance reflects an in-
principle decision to adopt OROP for all personnel belonging to the
armed forces. Evidently, the modalities of implementing OROP were yet
to be chalked out and were adopted later.
27. On 26-2-2014, a meeting was held by the Minister of Defence to
discuss the modalities for implementing the decision to adopt OROP.
Para 3 of the minutes of the meeting elaborate that OROP implies that:
(i) Uniform pension be paid to armed forces personnel retiring in
the same rank with the same length of service irrespective of the
date of retirement;
(ii) Any future enhancement in the rates of pension should be
passed on to past pensioners;
(iii) The gap between the rates of pension of current and past
pensioners should be bridged; and
(iv) Future enhancements in the rates of pension should be
automatically based (sic passed) on to the past pensioners at that
stage.
28. The CGDA was directed to initiate steps in consultation with the
Finance and Ex-servicemen Welfare Departments of the Ministry of
Defence to give effect to the decision. The meeting which was held on
26-2-2014 was part of the decision-making process of the Union
Government for determining the modalities for implementing OROP. On
26-2-2014, a communication was addressed by the Department of Ex-
Servicemen Welfare to CGDA noting that at the meeting chaired by the
Minister of Defence, it had been decided to implement OROP for all
ranks of the defence forces prospectively from the Financial Year of
2014-15. Para 2 of the communication reads as follows:
"Accordingly, CGDA may work out the modalities in consultation
with Service Hqrs., (who in turn may appropriately consult ex-
servicemen), Department of ESW and MoD (Fin.) and take necessary
steps to implement the same."
29. On 10-7-2014, the Minister of Finance in the course of his
speech while presenting the annual budget stated that the Union
Government had adopted the policy of OROP to address pension
disparity and a further sum of Rs 1000 crores was set aside to meet the
requirement of the year. On 2-12-2014, information on OROP was
furnished by the Minister of State for Defence in a reply to a Member of
the Rajya Sabha.
30. The adoption in principle of OROP followed by the discussion on
the modalities for implementing it eventually led to the communication
dated 7-11-2015 of the Ministry of Defence to the Chiefs of Army Staff,
Air Force Staff and Naval Staff. The communication indicates that:
"2. It has now been decided to implement "One Rank One
Pension" (OROP) for the ex-servicemen with effect from 1-7-2014.
OROP implies that uniform pension be paid to the Defence Forces
Personnel retiring in the same rank with the same length of service,
regardless of their date of retirement, which, implies bridging the
gap between the rates of pension of current and past pensioners at
periodic intervals. [sic]"
Para 3 of the communication adverts to the salient features:
"3. Salient features of the OROP are as follows:
(i) To begin with, pension of the past pensioner would be re-
fixed on the basis of pension of retirees of calendar year 2013 and
the benefit will be effective with effect from 1-7-2014.
(ii) Pension will be re-fixed for all pensioners on the basis of
the average of minimum and maximum pension of personnel
retired in 2013 in the same rank with the same length of service.
(iii) Pension for those drawing above the average shall be
protected.
(iv) Arrears will be paid in four equal half-yearly instalments.
However, all the family pensioners including those in receipt of
Special/Liberalised family pension and Gallantry award winners shall be
paid arrears in one instalment.
(v) In future, the pension would be re-fixed every 5 years."
The communication also indicated that personnel who opt to get
discharged henceforth would not be entitled to the benefit of OROP.
Moreover, the Union Government had decided to appoint a committee
to look into the anomaly in the implementation of OROP and its report
was to be submitted within six months.
31. The features of the policy communication of 7-11-2015 need to
be noticed. First, it contains the decision of the Indian Government to
implement OROP for ex-servicemen. Second, it specifies the date with
effect from which the decision would be implemented, namely, 1-7-
2014. Third, it embodies the understanding that OROP implies the
payment of uniform pension to defence personnel retiring in the same
rank with the same length of service regardless of the date of
retirement. Fourth, it emphasises the need to bridge the gap between
the rates of pension of current and past pensioners at "periodic
intervals".
32. A considerable amount of debate has taken place in these
proceedings on whether the expression "at periodic intervals" was in
breach of the original understanding that enhancements in the rates of
pension would be automatically passed on. While dealing with the
submission, it is important to note at the outset that right from the
Koshyari Committee Report, it was envisaged that "any future
enhancement in the rates of pension is to be automatically passed on to
the past pensioners". The statement made by the Union Minister of
Finance in the Lok Sabha on 17-2-2014 propounded in principle the
decision to implement OROP. At the meeting chaired by the Defence
Minister on 26-2-2014, it was again envisaged that "any future
enhancement in the rates of pension to be automatically passed on to
the past pensioners". The reply furnished in writing by the Minister of
State for Defence to a Member of the Rajya Sabha also similarly
indicates that "future enhancement in the rate of pension to be
automatically passed on to the past pensioners". The legislative and
other material prior to 7-11-2015 proposed that future enhancements
in the rates of pension would be automatically passed on. The
expression "automatically" was clearly not linked to a time period for
the revision of pensions. None of the documents on the record prior to
the communication dated 7-11-2015 suggests that the process of
revising pensions was to be continued on an ongoing basis as opposed
to revision at periodic intervals.
33. The fallacy in the submission of the petitioners is in the
argument that the policy communication dated 7-11-2015 is contrary
to the original decision which was taken by the Union Government to
implement OROP. Implicit in the submission of the petitioners is the
premise that the original decision was based on the Koshyari
Committee Report followed by the statement on the floor of the House
by the Minister of Finance (17-2-2014 and 10-7-2014) and the minutes
of the meeting convened by the Defence Minister (26-2-2014). Our
analysis of the underlying document indicates that while a decision to
implement OROP was taken in principle, the modalities for
implementation
were yet to be chalked out. Thus, there was no conscious policy
decision on the part of the Union Government on the modalities for
implementing OROP until the communication dated 7-11-2015 came
into being. The communication of 7-11-2015 cannot be invalidated on
the ground that it infringed the "original understanding" of OROP.
34. A hierarchy in law exists between statutes and rules - a
statutory provision will have precedence over delegated legislation if
the latter conflicts with the former. Similarly, executive instructions
cannot override a statute or rules made in pursuance of a statute. But
in the present case the entire canvas is governed by a policy. The terms
for implementing the policy were specified on 7-11-2015. Hence, that
element of the policy cannot be challenged on the notion that there is
an inflexible notion of OROP couched in an original understanding.
OROP is itself a matter of policy and it was open to the makers of the
policy to determine the terms of implementation. The policy is of course
subject to judicial review on constitutional parameters, which is a
distinct issue.
35. While the petitioners have not adverted to the doctrine of
legitimate expectations, they have implicitly relied on this principle.
The doctrine of legitimate expectations can be invoked if a
representation made by a public body leads an individual to believe
that they would be a recipient of a substantive benefit. A part of the
petitioners' grievance stems from the belief that an assurance made by
State functionaries, the Ministers of the Union Government, did not
translate into a conscious policy decision, which is embodied in the
communication dated 7-11-2015. We have stated above that the
expression "automatically" was clearly not linked to a time period for
the revision of pensions. But if it is to be assumed that the expression
"automatically" meant that the revision in the rates of pension would
take place on an ongoing basis rather than at periodic intervals, the
question arises whether the doctrine of legitimate expectations can be
invoked in the present case.
36. In State of Jharkhand V. Brahmputra Metallics Ltd. 8 a two-Judge
Bench of this Court, of which one of us (D.Y. Chandrachud, J.) was a
part, clarified the doctrinal difference between the concepts of
promissory estoppel and legitimate expectations. The Bench observed
that the doctrine of legitimate expectations, a public law concept, is
premised on the principles of fairness and non-arbitrariness in State
action. The doctrine of legitimate expectations emerges as a facet of
Article 14 of the Constitution. On the other hand, promissory estoppel,
being a private law concept, can be invoked if the State has entered
into a private contract with another entity but is inapplicable where a
representation has been made by the State in the discharge of its
public functions. The doctrine of legitimate expectations is applicable in
the latter situation. Noting that in India, the two doctrines have been
conflated, this Court went on to analyse if the change in an existing
government policy violates the legitimate expectations of those who
were previously covered by such policy. However, in the present case,
there was no concrete government policy in
existence prior to 7-11-2015. There existed only certain assurances
that were made by the Ministers, or which could be deduced from the
minutes of a meeting that was chaired by the Minister of Defence.
These assurances were also to the effect that OROP has been accepted
in principle. The implementation was yet to be worked out.
37. In State of Arunachal Pradesh V. Nezone Law House9, a two-
Judge Bench of this Court held that when the views of various
departments/Ministries are involved, an oral promise by a Minister does
not bind the Government. In that case, a law publisher had contended
that the then Law Minister had assured the publisher that certain books
will be purchased from it. The document that was relied upon by the
publisher was a departmental note which indicated that the decision
regarding the purchase was subject to the concurrence of other
"8. As noted above the factual scenario is interesting. The
document relied upon by the respondent and the High Court refers
to some oral expression of desire by the then Law Minister. When the
views of several departments were involved the question of any oral
view being expressed by a Minister is really not relevant. Further, the
document relied upon was nothing but a departmental note which
itself clearly indicated that the views of various
departments/Ministries were to be taken and their concurrence was
to be obtained. Apart from that, undisputedly there was some factual
dispute as to whether the intended purchase was of volumes or of
sets. There is conceptual difference between the two. The books were
not even printed at the relevant point of time. The High Court has
noticed only one volume had been printed. Further the need for the
purchase of the books for the judicial officers was to be assessed in
consultation with the High Court. The Law Minister could not have,
without taking the view of the High Court, placed orders. In any
event the dispute as to the volumes or the sets and the interpolation
in the documents were of considerable relevance. Unfortunately the
High Court has lightly brushed aside this aspect. The doctrines of
promissory estoppel and legitimate expectation were not applicable
to the facts of the case."
(emphasis supplied)
38. In the present case, discussions took place within the
Government and even as of 26-2-2014, the meeting chaired by the
Minister of Defence set out broad parameters of the decision, while
leaving it to the CGDA to ensure necessary steps in consultation with
the three services and the Finance and ESW wings of MoD "to give
effect to this decision". The meeting envisaged that family pensioners
and disabled pensioners would be included and that ex-servicemen
may also be properly consulted as required by the service. All this is
clearly suggestive of the fact that in the evolving decisions which were
taking place within the Government, a formulation of the precise
modalities which were to be adopted was yet to take place. This
eventually took place on 7-11-2015. The communication dated 7-11-
2015 cannot, therefore, be assailed on the ground that it is contrary to
the original intent of the policy formulated
by the Union Government. The policy of the Union Government is what
is embodied in the communication dated 7-11-2015. The statements
made on the Floor of the House and minutes of ministerial committees
are pointers to the fact that the Union Government had in principle
decided to implement OROP but the precise framework of its
implementation was a matter of evolving discussion within
Government. The formulation of modalities which took place in the
communication dated 7-11-2015 represents the policy choices adopted
by the Government.
39. While the communication dated 7-11-2015 is undoubtedly open
to be scrutinised on constitutional parameters, there is no substance in
the plea that the decision which was taken on 7-11-2015 is somehow
contrary to an original policy decision of the Union Government. The
policy and its modalities for implementation are those which have been
embodied in the communication dated 7-11-2015.
C.2. Plea of discrimination
40. The submission of the petitioners on the violation of Article 14 is
premised essentially on three aspects:
40.1. Fixation of the pension as of calendar year 2013 would result
in pre-2014 retirees getting less pension of one increment than a
soldier retiring after 2014.
40.2. Fixing the pension based on the mean of minimum and
maximum pension of 2013 would result in different pensions for the
same ranks and same length of service depending on whether the
personnel retired before or after 31-12-2013. In effect, a higher ranked
soldier would receive lesser pension on comparison to a lower ranked
soldier.
40.3. As a result of the process of equalisation every five years,
persons who have retired prior in point of time would be placed at a
disadvantage as their unequalised pension would be multiplied by a
factor of 2.57 while those who have retired after 1-1-2014 would get
the benefit of higher pension which would be multiplied by 2.57.
41. In the course of its comprehensive affidavit, the Union
Government attempted to explain the disparity in the pension payable
to a Sepoy with 15 years of qualifying service under OROP and the
actual pension of a Sepoy with 15 years of qualifying service who
retired in 2014 before the application of OROP. The following
explanation was offered to the three tabular charts appended as Figures
1, 2 and 3 above:
"A. Tabular Chart 1:
(a) In this table, the comparison made by the petitioner is
between pension payable to a Sepoy with 15 years of qualifying
service under OROP and the actual pension of a Sepoy who retired
in 2014 (before application of OROP) after 15 years' qualifying
service who is drawing pension in the rank of Naik, due to
operation of the Modified Assured Career Progression Scheme
[hereinafter referred to as 'MACP Scheme'].
(b) The figure of Rs 6666 is derived from the Table at p. 3 of
the Note. The figure of Rs 6665 denotes the weighted average
pension of the minimum and maximum pension of 2013 of
Sepoys who retired in 2013 with 15 years of qualifying service.
(c) The figure of Rs 7605 is derived from the Pension Payment
Order annexed at p. 5 of the Note. Pension is calculated on the
basis of 50% of the last pay drawn before retirement. This can be
arrived at by the following:
SI. No.

*
Figures from p. 5 of the Note
(d) The difference in pension between the two pensions in Tabular
Chart 1 is due to the applicability of the MACP Scheme
(implemented based on the recommendations of the 6th Central Pay
Commission). Under the MACP Scheme, a defence personnel who has
not been promoted for 8/16/24 years of regular service, would be
eligible for grant of next higher grade pay after completion of
8/16/14 years of regular service. In other words, a Sepoy who was
originally getting Rs 2000 as grade pay would after 8 years of service
(without promotion) be granted the next higher grade pay of Rs
2400. The grade pay of Rs 2400 ordinarily corresponds to the grade
pay of Naik.
(e) Similarly, after 16 years of service (without promotion), such
Sepoy would get the next higher grade pay of Rs 2800. The grade
pay of Rs 2800 ordinarily corresponds to the grade pay of Havildar.
(f) As a logical corollary, the pay (and consequently pension) of
different Sepoys would differ/vary depending on whether benefit of
the MACP Scheme has been granted to such Sepoy or not.
(g) The applicability of the MACP Scheme on the pension of a
retired defence personnel has been dealt by Circular No. 555 dated 4
-2-2016, wherein at Para 11(c), it has been stated:
"11. The provisions of this circular shall be applicable to all Pre-
1-7-2014 pensioners/family pensioners and their pension/family
pension shall be stepped up with reference to rank, group and
qualifying service in which they were pensioned.
Note : (a)-(b)
*
*
*
(c) A JCOs/ORs pensioner, who has retired with a particular
rank and granted ACP-I will be eligible for revision of pension of a
next higher rank; if ACP-II has been granted, he will be eligible
for revision of pension of next higher rank of ACP-I; and if ACP-III
has been granted, he will be eligible for revision of pension of next
higher rank of ACP-II w.e.f. 1-7-2014.
For example-A Sepoy granted ACP-I will be eligible for
revision of pension of Naik rank, Sepoy granted ACP-II will be
eligible for revision
of pension of Havildar rank and sepoy granted ACP-III will be eligible
for revision of pension of Naib Subedar rank ..]]
Therefore, the example of two Sepoys drawing different pension
amount is due to operation of MACP and is not due to operation of
the OROP Scheme.
(h) It is also important to point out that the MACP Scheme is only
one such factor which influences the pay drawn by a Sepoy. The
other factors include promotion, disciplinary proceedings, etc.
B. Tabular Chart 2:
(a) In this chart, the pension of a Naik has been compared with a
person drawing pension of Havildar by virtue of the MACP Scheme.
(b) The figure of Rs 7170 is derived from the Table at p. 4 of the
Note. The figure of Rs 7170 denotes the weighted average pension of
the minimum and maximum pension of 2013.
(c) The figure of Rs 8295 is derived from the pension payment
order annexed at p. 6 of the Note. Pension is calculated on the basis
of 50% of the last pay drawn before retirement. This can be arrived
at by the following:
SI. No.
Particulars
Amount (in Rs)
1.
Last pay
11,490
2.
Grade pay
2800
3.
MSP
2000
4.
Class allowance
300
5.
Total
16,590
6.
Pension (50% of last pay)
8295
(d) Now, due to the operation of the MACP Scheme, the Naik
(grade pay of Rs 2400) is actually drawing the next higher grade pay
of Rs 2800, which corresponds to the grade pay of Havildar. This is
the same principle, which was the basis for difference in pension in
Tabular Chart 1.
C. Tabular Chart III:
(a) Tabular Chart III pertains to the rank of Group Captain. As per
Column II of this chart, the example quoted is that of a 2014 retiree.
However, the pension amount quoted is of Group Captain Daniel
Victor, who retired on 28-2-2015. It is important to state that the
OROP Scheme was not applicable to Group Captain Daniel Victor.
(e) Therefore, the petitioner has misled this Hon'ble Court by
relying on the pension of a recent retiree who has not been covered
under the OROP Scheme. The PPO Number of Group Captain Daniel
Victor is 08/14/1/114/2015.
18. It is further submitted that the flaw in pointing out the
alleged disparities by referring to the Tables at p. 1 of the Note are
due to the following reasons, inter alia:
(i) The comparison as mentioned in the Table is a comparison
between non-comparables. The weighted average pension of the
minimum and maximum pension of 2013 can never be compared
with the actual amount
being received by a defence personnel as pension fixed under the rules
applicable for retiring pension in the normal course.
(ii) The weighted average pension signifies the
lowest/minimum amount that a defence personnel retiring up to
2013 is entitled to get as OROP pension. Whereas, the actual
pension of the retired defence personnel in 2014 (without effect of
OROP) is based on pay last drawn. This amount of actual pension
may be higher (due to various factors), but cannot be lower than
the weighted average pension, as in that case, pension would be
raised (protected) to the level of the weighted average pension
(OROP).
(iii) In other words, the pension amount of Rs 6665 is the
minimum prescribed benchmark amount that any Sepoy (with 15
years' qualifying service) would get under OROP as per Table 7 at
p. 3 of the Note. Therefore, no Sepoy with the same pay and same
length of service will get an amount less than Rs 6665 under
OROP. The minimum prescribed benchmark is fixed to ensure that
all defence personnel retiring pre-2013 are pulled up to receive at
least the minimum prescribed pension. The benchmarking to the
average of the minimum and maximum ensures upliftment of
those receiving below the benchmark rate, whereas, protection of
those who are receiving a higher pension than the benchmark
rate.
(iv) The petitioner's interpretation is an attempt to equalise the
pension of every defence personnel with the highest pension
drawn by a defence personnel in the same rank with the same
length of service. Such an interpretation is completely arbitrary
definition of how OROP should be implemented."
42. During the course of the hearing, the Union Government placed
on record a further affidavit. The affidavit places on record the status of
the grant of MACP benefits to defence personnel across the three
services. The sample data for 2013 which was the base year for the
calculation has been placed on the record and is reproduced below:
"
(v) Likewise, a Sepoy who gets promoted at the first instance
as Naik in its natural course but does not get promoted for the
subsequent ranks (which may happen due to non-availability of
vacancies or stagnation) would be entitled to the MACP upgradations
of those ranks.
(vi) It is also respectfully submitted that the threshold condition
to qualify for MACP is the completion of the required length of
service. Consequently, one who completed the required length of
service would qualify for MACP automatically unless otherwise barred
due to disciplinary proceedings or performance.
(vii) It is also respectfully submitted that the threshold condition
to qualify for MACP is the completion of the required length of
service. Consequently, one who completes the required length of
service would qualify for MACP automatically unless otherwise barred
due to disciplinary proceedings or performance.
(viii) It is therefore self-evident that a Sepoy who does not
complete the required length of service of 8 years and one who
completed it, cannot be benchmarked together under any
circumstances.
(ix) A Sepoy of 3 years and a Sepoy who had crossed 8 years
qualifying for MACP is not equated even for OROP purpose since they
do not qualify the criteria of "same length of service."
(emphasis supplied)
While explaining the difference in pensions of the two Sepoys, the
Union Government stated that this was due to the applicability of the
MACP Scheme. In the subsequent affidavit, some of the issues which
remained to be explained in the comprehensive affidavit have been
attempted to be clarified.
C.2.1. ACP-MACP
43. In 2013, the ACP regime was put into place. In terms of the
scheme, a Sepoy upon completion of ten years of service would be
upgraded to a Naik for the purpose of pay, pension and other special
benefits. After completion of 20 years' service, there would be a further
upgradation to the pay of a Havildar and after 30 years' service, as a
Naib Subedar. Though the scheme was implemented from 2014, the
benefit was extended retrospectively by applying the norms of 10 : 20 :
30 years of service, respectively. Hence, a Sepoy in 2013 with thirty
years of service was grouped with a Naib Subedar for pay, pension and
other financial benefits. The ACP scheme thus covered defence
personnel tracing back in time to 1973.
44. On 11-10-2008, by Army Instruction No. 1/S/2008, the MACP
Scheme was implemented. In terms of the scheme, the earlier timeline
of 10 : 20 : 30 years of service for upgradation was modified to 8 : 16
:
24 years for conferment of benefits in terms of pay, pension and other
financial benefits. In view of the decision of this Court in Union of India
V. Balbir Singh Turn10, the MACP Scheme was made operational with
effect from 1-1-2006. Though the MACP Scheme was made operational
from 1-1-2006, it had retrospective effect as a result of which any
person who was in service and qualified with the threshold requirement
of 8 : 16 : 24 years of service came to be grouped with the
corresponding rank upgradations for the purpose of pay, pension and
other benefits. In the above backdrop, the Union Government has
stated before this Court on affidavit that for the purpose of computing
the OROP benefit, it has taken MACP as the base and applied it across
the board for all retirees having the same length of service. In other
words, OROP was not calculated in two parts comprising of the ACP
regime and MACP regime.
45. In this context, reliance has been placed on Note VI appended to
the table for working out OROP calculations. Note VI reads as follows:
"Pension of JCO/ORS granted upgradation under ACP/MACP
Scheme shall be revised with reference to the rank for which
ACP/MACP was granted."
46. On the above premises, it has been submitted that no disparity
on the ground of MACP/ACP has been introduced and the core value of
uniform pension for a person retiring in the same rank with the same
length of service is maintained without disparity.
C.2.2. Financial implications
47. The Union Government has stated on affidavit that at the time
when OROP was implemented, the annual financial implication was in
the amount of Rs 7,123.38 crores. The actual arrears which had to be
paid for the period of 1-7-2014 to 31-12-2015 stood in the amount of
Rs 10,392.35 crores.
48. The table on the status of the grant of MACP benefits to defence
personnel (2013) indicates that 96.4% Sepoys, 72.3% Naiks, 48.9%
Havildars and 90.9% Art III-I (Navy only) represent the percentage of
retirees getting MACP benefits. This indicates that MACP benefit forms a
significant portion of the retiring personnel in the above four ranks, the
last one being relevant only for the Navy. The MACP factor is not of
much impact in the case of Naib Subedar, Subedar and Subedar Major,
among whom 1.6%, 2.2% and 0.2% of all retiring personnel are
receiving MACP benefits. This is because they would have reached those
ranks by regular promotion.
49. When a Sepoy with eight years of service is upgraded as a Naik
and thereafter as a Havildar and Naib Subedar after sixteen and twenty
-four years of service, other financial benefits attached to the higher
ranks accrue automatically to an MACP beneficiary. However, if a Sepoy
is promoted to the rank of Naik in the natural course before eight years
of service, such a person does not qualify for MACP and the same
principle applies to the further upgradation. Where a Sepoy is promoted
as a Naik in the usual course, but does not get promoted thereafter to
subsequent ranks for non-availability of vacancies, such a Sepoy would
be entitled to MACP upgradation only for those ranks. The threshold
requirement for the grant of MACP is completion of a specified length of
service. A Sepoy who does not complete the required length of service
cannot hence be benchmarked with someone who completes the
stipulated length of service for the grant of MACP benefits. In other
words, a Sepoy with three years of service and a Sepoy who has
acquired eight years of service thereby qualifying for MACP are not
equated even after OROP purposes since they did not both have the
same length of service from the past rank of Naib Subedar.
50. According to the Union Government, if non-MACP personnel are
grouped with MACP personnel for the payment of OROP, the total
financial outflow from 2014 would be in the range of Rs 42,776.38
crores. If non-MACP persons were required to be matched with MACP,
the financial implication for the period from 1-7-2014 to 31-12-2015
would stand at Rs 13,731.03 crores. If such a benefit is given, the
financial implication for 2021 under the Seventh Pay Commission would
require a conversion factor of 2.57 besides which 31% DR would be
payable. As noted earlier, it has been stated that when OROP is
implemented, the annual financial implication was in the amount of Rs
7,123.38
crores. If non-MACP personnel had to be matched with MACP personnel,
this figure would stand increased to Rs 9,411.71 crores.
51. Based on this, the following tabulation has been submitted by
the Union Government on affidavit indicating a total outflow if non-
MACP were to be matched with MACP:

C.2.3. Average to maximum
52. The Court has been apprised of the fact that the CGDA Working
Committee considered four options for OROP in the year 2013. Of the
four options, the fourth option was on the basis of the maximum
pension of current retirees, which was proposed by the services. The
Committee noted that the financial implication of the fourth option
(maximum pension of current retirees) was Rs 14,898.34 crores per
annum and the total arrears which would be payable on this basis
would have been in the amount of Rs 1,45,339.34 crores, as is

C.2.4. Periodic revision every five years
53. The central limb of the submission of the petitioners is that a
revision of OROP should be automatic. The Union Government has
submitted that besides lacking any prior precedent, in terms of the
practice governing pay scales, pensions and other financial emoluments
of government servants, automatic revision would be impossible to
implement. Quite apart from the above consideration, it is evident that
the three documents which have been
relied upon by the petitioners, namely, (i) the Koshyari Committee
Report; (ii) the minutes of the meeting chaired by the Defence Minister
on 26-2-2014; and (iii) the communication dated 26-2-2014 to CGDA
underscore that "any future enhancement in the rates of pension to be
automatically passed on to the past pensioners". The expression "to be
automatically passed on" immediately follows upon the words "any
future enhancement in the rates of pension". When read together
contextually, it signifies that the rates of pension would be passed on to
past pensioners without any administrative impediments. The
expression "automatically passed on" cannot be construed as a
commitment with reference to any period of time for the computation of
benefits. The manner in which and the period over which revisions
should take place of pensions, salaries and other financial benefits is a
pure question of policy. The decision of the Central Government to
revise the pension every five years cannot be held to violate the
precepts underlying Article 14.
54. The policy choices which have been made by the Union
Government must also be understood in the context that the estimated
budget allocation for defence pensions is Rs 1,33,825 crores
representing 28.39% of the total defence budget estimate of Rs
4,71,378 crores for 2020-2021. This does not include budget on
salaries which is of the order of 34.89% of the total defence budget
estimates for 2020-2021. Salaries and pensions thus account for nearly
63% of the total defence budget estimates for 2020-2021. In making
policy choices, the Union Government is entitled to take into account
priorities towards modernisation of the armed forces and to modulate
the grant of financial benefits so as to subserve and balance distinct
priorities.
55. In the decision of this Court in NakaraÂ³, the Constitution Bench
was deciding on the issue of whether the date of retirement would be a
relevant consideration for determining the application of a revised
formula for the computation of pension. The liberalised pension scheme
was made applicable prospectively to those employees who retired on
or after 31-3-1979 in the case of government servants covered by the
1972 Rules and in respect of defence personnel, those who became non
-effective on or after 1-4-1979. Consequently, those who retired prior
to the date were not entitled to the benefits of the liberalised pension
scheme. It was held that payment of pension constitutes a
compensation for the service rendered in the past and as a measure of
social welfare for providing socio-economic justice to those who have
rendered service to the State. The Court noted that earlier, the measure
of pension was related to the average emoluments during a period of
thirty-six months prior to retirement. By a liberalised scheme, the
period was reduced to an average of ten months preceding the date of
retirement coupled with the above aspects. A slab system for
computation was introduced and the ceiling was raised. This Court held
that there was no justification for arbitrarily selecting the criteria for
eligibility for the grant of benefits under the scheme based on the date
of retirement. Hence, this Court held that all pensioners formed a
homogeneous
class and where an existing scheme of pension was liberalised, a
distinction could not be made on the basis of a specified cut-off date.
56. At the same time, it must also be noted that the decision in
NakaraÂ³ noted that "the financial implication in such matters has some
relevance". This Court struck down the portion of the memoranda by
which the benefit of the liberalised pension scheme was only confined
to persons retiring on or after the specified date which resulted in the
benefit being extended to all retirees, irrespective of the date of
retirement.
para 63)
" The financial implication in such matters has some relevance.
However in this connection, we want to steer clear of a
misconception. There is no pension fund as it is found either in
contributory pension schemes administered in foreign countries or as
in insurance-linked pensions. Non-contributory pensions under the
1972 Rules is a State obligation. It is an item of expenditure voted
year to year depending upon the number of pensioners and the
estimated expenditure. Now when the liberalised pension scheme
was introduced, we would justifiably assume that the government
servants would retire from the next day of the coming into operation
of the scheme and the burden will have to be computed as imposed
by the liberalised scheme. Further Government has been granting
since nearly a decade temporary increases from time to time to
pensioners. Therefore, the difference will be marginal. Further, let it
not be forgotten that the old pensioners are on the way out and their
number is fast decreasing. While examining the financial implication,
this Court is only concerned with the additional liability that may be
imposed by bringing in pensioners who retired prior to 1-4-1979
within the fold of liberalised pension scheme but effective
subsequent to the specified date. That it is a dwindling number is
indisputable. And again the large bulk comprises pensioners from
lower echelons of service such as Peons, LDC, UDC, Assistant, etc. In
a chart submitted to us, the Union of India has worked out the
pension to the pensioners who have retired prior to the specified
date and the comparative advantage, if they are brought within the
purview of the liberalised pension scheme. The difference up to the
level of Assistant or even Section Officer is marginal keeping in view
that the old pensioners are getting temporary increases. Amongst
the higher officers, there will be some difference because the ceiling
is raised and that would introduce the difference. It is however
necessary to refer to one figure relied upon by respondents. It was
said that if pensioners who retired prior to 31-3-1979 are brought
within the purview of the liberalised pension scheme, Rs 233 crores
would be required for fresh commutation. The apparent fallacy in the
submission is that if the benefit of commutation is already availed of,
it cannot and need not be reopened. And availability of other
benefits is hardly a relevant factor because pension is admissible
to all retirees. The figures submitted are thus neither frightening nor
the liability is supposed to be staggering which would deflect us from
going to the logical and of constitutional mandate. Even according to
the most liberal estimate, the average yearly increase is worked out to
be Rs 51 crores but that assumes that every pensioner has survived till
date and will continue to survive. Therefore, we are satisfied that the
increased liability consequent upon this judgment is not too high to be
unbearable or such as would have detracted the Government from
covering the old pensioners under the Scheme."
(emphasis supplied)
58. As opposed to the factual matrix in NakaraÂ³ where the
liberalised pension scheme was not made applicable to employees who
had retired prior to the cut-off date, in this case the OROP principle is
applicable to all retired army personnel, irrespective of the date of
retirement. The cut-off date is only prescribed for determining the base
salary used for computing the pension. While for those who retired on
or after 2014, the last drawn salary is used for computing the pension;
for those who retired prior to 2014, the average of the salary drawn in
2013 is used. This policy only seeks to protect those who retired before
2014 since the last drawn salary of the prior retirees might be too low
and incomparable to the pay of the 2014 retirees. Moreover, if the
maximum salary drawn is to be used as the base value instead of
taking the average salary, an additional outlay of Rs 1,45,339.34 crores
would be incurred. The executive is therefore, well within its limits to
prescribe a policy keeping in view the financial implications.
59. In Krishena Kumar11, a Constitution Bench of this Court decided
on the issue of whether the prescription of a cut-off date for the
eligibility to a pension scheme was arbitrary and violative of Article 14.
Before 1957, the only scheme for retirement benefits in the Railways
was the Provident Fund Scheme. This scheme was replaced in 1957 by
the Pension Scheme. All the employees who served in the Railways on
or after 1-4-1957 were automatically covered by the Pension Scheme.
Those who were in service before 1-4-1957 were given the option to
switch over to the pensionary benefits. It was the contention of the
appellants that till 1-4-1957, there was no difference between the
benefits receivable under the provident fund scheme and the pension
scheme. However, it was contended that between 1957 and 1987, the
pensionary benefits were increased by various methods while the
benefits under the provident fund scheme were not enhanced.
60. Dismissing the petitions, this Court held that neither the
prescription of a cut-off date nor the creation of two classes of retirees
(pensioners and provident fund holders) was contrary to the decision of
the Constitution Bench in NakaraÂ³. It was observed thus : (Krishena
"32. In NakaraÂ³ it was never held that both the pension retirees
and the PF retirees formed a homogeneous class and that any further
classification among them would be violative of Article 14. On the
other hand the Court clearly observed that it was not dealing with
the problem of a "fund". The Railway Contributory Provident Fund is
by definition a fund. Besides, the Government's obligation towards
an employee under CPF Scheme to give the matching contribution
begins as soon as his account is opened and ends with his
retirement when his rights qua the Government in respect of the
Provident Fund is finally crystallised and thereafter no statutory
obligation continues. Whether there still remained a moral obligation
is a different matter. On the other hand under the Pension Scheme
the Government's obligation does not begin until the employee
retires when only it begins and it continues till the death of the
employee. Thus, on the retirement of an employee government's
legal obligation under the Provident Fund account ends while under
the Pension Scheme it begins. The rules governing the Provident
Fund and its contribution are entirely different from the rules
governing pension. It would not, therefore, be reasonable to argue
that what is applicable to the pension retirees must also equally be
applicable to PF retirees. This being the legal position the rights of
each individual PF retiree finally crystallised on his retirement
whereafter no continuing obligation remained while, on the other
hand, as regard Pension retirees, the obligation continued till their
death. The continuing obligation of the State in respect of pension
retirees is adversely affected by fall in rupee value and rising prices
which, considering the corpus already received by the PF retirees
they would not be so adversely affected ipso facto. It cannot,
therefore, be said that it was the ratio decidendi in NakaraÂ³ that the
State's obligation towards its PF retirees must be the same as that
towards the pension retirees. An imaginary definition of obligation to
include all the Government retirees in a class was not decided and
could not form the basis for any classification for the purpose of this
case. NakaraÂ³ cannot, therefore, be an authority for this case.
*
*
*
34. The next argument of the petitioners is that the option given
to the PF employees to switch over to the pension scheme with effect
from a specified cut-off date is bad as violative of Article 14 of the
Constitution for the same reasons for which in Nakara 3
the
notification were read down. We have extracted the 12th option
letter. This argument is fallacious in view of the fact that while in
case of pension retirees who are alive the Government has a
continuing obligation and if one is affected by dearness the others
may also be similarly affected. In case of PF retirees each one's
rights having finally crystallised on the date of retirement and
receipt of PF benefits and there being no continuing obligation
thereafter they could not be treated on a par with the living
pensioners. How the corpus after retirement of a PF
retiree was affected or benefitted by prices and interest rise was not
kept any tack of by the Railways. It appears in each of the cases of
option the specified date bore a definite nexus to the objects sought to
be achieved by giving of the option. Option once exercised was told to
have been final. Options were exercisable vice versa."
(emphasis supplied)
61. In Indian Ex-Services League4, it was contended that in view of
the decision in Nakara all retirees who held the same rank irrespective
of the date of retirement must receive the same amount of pension.
This Court observed that there was nothing in Nakara 3 that backed the
claim of the appellants that the same pension must be given to all
retirees of the same rank. The Court observed that it was held in
Nakara that only the same formula for calculation of pension was to be
used and nowhere was the emoluments of the retirees revised.
62. The ratio decidendi in NakaraÂ³ was explained in the following
"12. The liberalised pension scheme in the context of which the
decision was rendered in Nakara provided for computation of
pension according to a more liberal formula under which "average
emoluments" were determined with reference to the last ten months'
salary instead of 36 months' salary provided earlier yielding a higher
average, coupled with a slab system and raising the ceiling limit for
pension. This Court held that where the mode of computation of
pension is liberalised from a specified date, its benefit must be given
not merely to retirees subsequent to that date but also to earlier
existing retirees irrespective of their date of retirement even though
the earlier retirees would not be entitled to any arrears prior to the
specified date on the basis of the revised computation made
according to the liberalised formula. For the purpose of such a
scheme all existing retirees irrespective of the date of their
retirement, were held to constitute one class, any further division
within that class being impermissible. According to that decision, the
pension of all earlier retirees was to be recomputed as on the
specified date in accordance with the liberalised formula of
computation on the basis of the average emoluments of each retiree
payable on his date of retirement. For this purpose there was no
revision of the emoluments of the earlier retirees under the scheme.
It was clearly stated that `if the pensioners form a class, their
computation cannot be by different formula affording unequal
treatment solely on the ground that some retired earlier and some
retired later'. This according to us is the decision in Nakara 3 and no
more."
(emphasis supplied)
It was observed that the effect of the judgment in Nakara 3 was that the
same computation according to the liberalised formula must be
applicable to pre and post 1-4-1979 retirees and that the decision
cannot be construed to mean that the same amount of pension must be
receivable.
In K.L. Rathee V. Union of India the decision in Nakara 3 was
paras 6-7)
"6. Nakara case 3 dealt with the manner of calculation of pension
on the basis of average emoluments of a retired government
employee. Prior to the liberalisation of the formula for computation of
pension made by the memorandum dated 25-5-1979, average
emoluments of the last thirty months of service of the employee
provided that basis for calculation of pension. The 1979
Memorandum provided that average emoluments must be calculated
on the basis of the emoluments received by a government servant
during the last ten months of the service. That apart, a new slab
system for computation of pension was introduced and the ceiling on
pension was raised.
7. It is to be seen that the judgment did not strike down the
definition of "emoluments". It merely held that if pension was to be
calculated on the basis of the last ten months' emoluments of a
government servant, after 1-4-1979, there is no reason why those
who retired before 1-4-1979 should get pension calculated on the
basis of average of last thirty-six months' emoluments. In other
words, the rule of computation must be the same. The Court did not
hold that those who have retired before 1-4-1979 must be treated as
having the same emoluments as those who retired on or after 1-4-
1979 for the purpose of calculation of pension. Therefore, on the
strength of Nakara caseÂ³, the petitioner is not entitled to ask for
computation of pension with reference to emoluments which he
never got."
64. In B.J. Akkara V. Union of India 12 this Court summarised the
principles relating to pension. R.V. Raveendran, J. writing for a two-
"20. The principles relating to pension relevant to the issue are
well settled. They are:
(a) In regard to pensioners forming a class, computation of
pension cannot be by different formula thereby applying an
unequal treatment solely on the ground that some retired earlier
and some retired later. If the retiree is eligible for pension at the
time of his retirement and the relevant pension scheme is
subsequently amended, he would become eligible to get
enhanced pension as per the new formula of computation of
pension from the date when the amendment takes effect. In such
a situation, the additional benefit under the amendment, made
available
to the same class of pensioners cannot be denied to him on the ground
that he had retired prior to the date on which the aforesaid additional
benefit was conferred.
(b) But all retirees retiring with a particular rank do not form a
single class for all purposes. Where the reckonable emoluments as
on the date of retirement (for the purpose of computation of
pension) are different in respect of two groups of pensioners, who
retired with the same rank, the group getting lesser pension
cannot contend that their pension should be identical with or
equal to the pension received by the group whose reckonable
emolument was higher. In other words, pensioners who retire with
the same rank need not be given identical pension, where their
average reckonable emoluments at the time of their retirement
were different, in view of the difference in pay, or in view of
different pay scales being in force.
*
*
*
One set cannot claim the benefit extended to the other set on the
ground that they are similarly situated. Though they retired with the
same rank, they are not of the "same class" or "homogeneous
group". The employer can validly fix a cut-off date for introducing
any new pension/retirement scheme or for discontinuance of any
existing scheme. What is discriminatory is introduction of a benefit
retrospectively (or prospectively) fixing a cut-off date arbitrarily
thereby dividing a single homogeneous class of pensioners into two
groups and subjecting them to different treatment."
(emphasis supplied)
65. The decision in SPS Vains' 2 has been relied upon by the
petitioners. The issue in that case was whether the officers of the rank
of Major General, who had retired prior to 1-1-1996, could be given the
benefit of the provisions of the revised pay scale, though according to
the policy only those who retired after the said cut-off date would be
entitled to such benefit. The rank of Brigadier is a feeder post for the
promotional rank of Major General. A Major General always drew a
higher pension than the pension payable to the officers holding the
rank of a Brigadier, as on the basis of the recommendation of the
Fourth Pay Commission, the pension was calculated on the basis of the
salary drawn during the last ten months prior to retirement. An
anomaly arose with the acceptance of the recommendation of the Fifth
Pay Commission which created a situation in which a Brigadier began
drawing more pension and family pension than the Major General. The
Government increased the pension of Major Generals who had retired
prior to 1996 so that they do not receive lesser pension than the
officers of the rank of Brigadier.
66. The disparity which was noted in that case is evident from the
23)
"23. From the submissions made the dispute appears to be
confined only to the question whether officers of the rank of Major
General in the army and of equivalent rank in the two other wings of
the Defence forces,
who had retired prior to 1-1-1996 have been validly excluded from the
benefit of the revision of pay scales in keeping with the
recommendations of the Fifth Central Pay Commission by virtue of the
Special Army Instruction 2/S/1998."
67. This Court in SPS Vains2 held that such a disparity in the
pension payable to two groups of officers occupying the same rank of
Major General based on those retiring before or after 1-1-1996 violated
Article 14. It was in this backdrop that this Court directed that the pay
of all pensioners in the rank of Major General and its equivalent rank in
the other two wings of the Defence Services should be notionally fixed
at the rate given to the similar officers of the same rank after the
revision of pay scales with effect from 1-1-1996, and thereafter to
compute the pensionary benefits with prospective effect from the date
of the writ petition. The decision in SPS Vains2 thus involved
a
completely different factual situation. The rank of Brigadier was a
feeder post for the rank of Major General. An anomaly had arisen as a
result of which the pay and pension of Brigadier were higher than of the
Major Generals. By increasing the pension of Major General, distinction
was made between those who had retired before and after 1-1-1996.
This was held to be violative of Article 14.
68. The canvass which is sought to be traversed in these
proceedings under Article 32 of the Constitution trenches upon a
domain which is reserved for executive policy. We must remember that
adjudication cannot serve as a substitute for policy. Lon Fuller
described public policy issues that come up in adjudication as
"polycentric problems", that is, they raise questions that have a
"multiplicity of variable and interlocking factors, decisions on each one
of which presupposes a decision on all others". Such matters, according
to Fuller, are more suitably addressed by elected representatives since
they involve negotiations, trade-offs and a consensus-driven decision-
making process. Fuller argues that adjudication is more appropriate for
questions that result in "either-or" answers. 13 Most questions of policy
involve complex considerations of not only technical and economic
factors but also require balancing competing interests for which
democratic reconciliation rather than adjudication is the best remedy.
Further, an increased reliance on Judges to solve matters of pure policy
diminishes the role of other political organs in resolving contested
issues of social and political policy, which require a democratic
dialogue. This is not to say that this Court will shy away from setting
aside policies that impinge on constitutional rights. Rather it is to
provide a clear-eyed role of the function that a court serves in a
democracy. The OROP Policy may only be challenged on the ground that
it is manifestly arbitrary or capricious. In this regard, we now evaluate
the policy which has been adopted by the Union Government.
69. The policy of OROP adopted by the Union Government stipulates
thus:
(i) The benefits will be effective from 1-7-2014;
(ii) Pensions of past pensioners would be refixed on the basis of
the pension of retirees of calendar year 2013;
(iii) Pension for all pensioners would be protected; and
(iv) In future, the pension would be refixed after every five years.
70. The principles governing pensions and cut-off dates can be
summarised as follows:
70.1. All pensioners who hold the same rank may not for all
purposes form a homogeneous class. For example, amongst Sepoys
differences do exist in view of the MACP and ACP Schemes. Certain
Sepoys receive the pay of the higher ranked personnel.
70.2. The benefit of a new element in a pensionary scheme can be
prospectively applied. However, the scheme cannot bifurcate a
homogeneous group based on a cut-off date.
70.3. The judgment of the Constitution Bench in Nakara 3 cannot be
interpreted to read the one rank one pension rule into it. It was only
held that the same principle of computation of pensions must be
applied uniformly to a homogeneous class.
70.4. It is not a legal mandate that pensioners who held the same
rank must be given the same amount of pension. The varying benefits
that may be applicable to certain personnel which would also impact
the pension payable need not be equalised with the rest of the
personnel.
71. Applying the above principles to the facts of the case, we find no
constitutional infirmity in the OROP principle as defined by the
communication dated 7-11-2015 for the following reasons:
71.1. The definition of OROP is uniformly applicable to all the
pensioners irrespective of the date of retirement. It is not the case of
the petitioners that the pension is reviewed "automatically" to a class of
the pensioners and "periodically" to another class of the pensioners.
71.2. The cut-off date is used only for the purpose of determining
the base salary for the calculation of pension. While for those who
retired after 2014, the last drawn salary is used to calculate pension,
for those who retired prior to 2013, the average salary drawn in 2013 is
used. Since the uniform application of the last drawn salary for the
purpose of calculating pension would put the prior retirees at a
disadvantage, the Union Government has taken a policy decision to
enhance the base salary for the calculation of pension. Undoubtedly,
the Union Government had a range of policy choices including taking
the minimum, the maximum or the mean or average. The Union
Government decided to adopt the average. Persons below the average
were brought up to
the average mark while those drawing above the average were
protected. Such a decision lies within the ambit of policy choices.
71.3. While no legal or constitutional mandate of OROP can be read
into the decisions in NakaraÂ³ and SPS Vains2, varying pension payable
to officers of the same rank retiring before and after 1-7-2014 either
due to MACP or the different base salary used for the calculation of
pension cannot be held arbitrary.
71.4. Since the OROP definition is not arbitrary, it is not necessary
for us to undertake the exercise of determining if the financial
implications of the scheme is negligible or enormous.
72. In terms of the communication dated 7-11-2015, the benefit of
OROP was to be effected from 1-7-2014. Para 3(v) of the
communication states that "in future, the pension would be re-fixed
every five years". Such an exercise has remained to be carried out after
the expiry of five years possibly because of the pendency of the present
proceedings.
73. We accordingly order and direct that in terms of the
communication dated 7-11-2015, a re-fixation exercise shall be carried
out from 1-7-2019, upon the expiry of five years. Arrears payable to all
eligible pensioners of the armed forces shall be computed and paid over
accordingly within a period of three months.
74. The petition is disposed of in the above terms. Pending
application(s), if any, shall stand disposed of.
