Appellant;

STATE OF RAJASTHAN
Respondent.
Criminal Appeal No. of decided on June 24, 2022
A. Penal Code, 1860 - Ss. 302, 363, 365 and 376(2)(f) - Death
sentence - Whether to be confirmed/imposed, or, not, upon application of
"crime test", "criminal test" and "rarest of the rare test" Law
summarised
B. Penal Code, 1860 - Ss. 302, 363, 365 and 376(2)(f) - Death
sentence - Confirmation of - When warranted - Scope of reformation and
rehabilitation - When can be ruled out - Extremely brutal and merciless
rape and murder of physically and mentally challenged minor of about 7-8
yrs - Death sentence, confirmed
- Trial court scrupulously carried out its duty in terms of S. 235(2) CrPC, as it
took up the question of sentence after 3 clear days of pronouncement of judgment
of conviction and the death sentence awarded by it only after duly hearing the
appellant-accused, after duly taking into consideration the aggravating and
mitigating factors, and while duly recording special reasons
- "Crime test", held, also against the appellant by considering brutal rape and
killing of a mentally and physically challenged girl who found aged only about seven-
and-a-half-years-old and when the manner of commission of both the major
offences of rape and murder showed depravity of highest order and ex facie
shocked everyone's conscience
- Regarding "criminal test", factors of the age, family and socio-economic
background of the appellant, held, not so clinching as to overwhelm and override
said aggravating factors - Further held, there did not exist a reasonable probability
of reformation and rehabilitation of the appellant, because not only was the crime in
question committed by using a stolen motorcycle, but he was also found involved in
other criminal cases prior to commission of crime in question - Further, the
appellant not only earned 7 days' punishment in jail for quarrelling with a co-inmate
but was also convicted of the offence of murder of another jail inmate -
Considering factual position, prayer for calling of psychological evaluation report of
the appellant, declined - Resultantly, considering entire materials including medical
evidence which indicated gruesome injuries on and around private parts of the
victim girl and horrid injuries on her head, case held falling in category of the rarest
of rare cases and, thus, death sentence confirmed
Held :
As regards the statutory requirements, as per sub-section (2) of Section 235
CrPC, on being convicted and not being released on probation or after admonition in
terms of Section 360 CrPC, the accused has to be heard by the Judge concerned
on the question of sentence and then, sentence has to be passed according to law.
Moreover, as per sub-section (3) of Section 354 CrPC, if the conviction is for an
offence punishable with death or in the alternative, with imprisonment for life or
imprisonment for a particular term of years, the judgment has to state the reasons
for the sentence awarded; and in case of death sentence, the judgment has to
state "special reasons" therefor.
(Para 64)
As per previous decisions of the Supreme Court, aggravating circumstances
(crime test) and the mitigating circumstances (criminal test) can be summarised as
follows (non-exhaustively):
Aggravating circumstances - (Crime test)
(1) The offences relating to the commission of heinous crimes like murder,
rape, armed dacoity, kidnapping, etc. by the accused with a prior record of
conviction for capital felony or offences committed by the person having a
substantial history of serious assaults and criminal convictions.
(2) The offence was committed while the offender was engaged in the
commission of another serious offence.
(3) The offence was committed with the intention to create a fear psychosis
in the public at large and was committed in a public place by a weapon or device
which clearly could be hazardous to the life of more than one person.
(4) The offence of murder was committed for ransom or like offences to
receive money or monetary benefits.
(5) Hired killings.
(6) The offence was committed outrageously for want only while involving
inhumane treatment and torture to the victim.
(7) The offence was committed by a person while in lawful custody.
(8) The murder or the offence was committed to prevent a person lawfully
carrying out his duty like arrest or custody in a place of lawful confinement of
himself or another. For instance, murder is of a person who had acted in lawful
discharge of his duty under Section 43 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.
(9) When the crime is enormous in proportion like making an attempt of
murder of the entire family or members of a particular community.
(10) When the victim is innocent, helpless or a person relies upon the trust of
relationship and social norms, like a child, helpless woman, a daughter or a niece
staying with a father/uncle and is inflicted with the crime by such a trusted
person.
(11) When murder is committed for a motive which evidences total depravity
and meanness.
(12) When there is a cold-blooded murder without provocation.
(13) The crime is committed so brutally that it pricks or shocks not only the
judicial conscience but even the conscience of the society.
Mitigating circumstances - (Criminal test)
(1) The manner and circumstances in and under which the offence was
committed, for example, extreme mental or emotional disturbance or extreme
provocation in contradistinction to all these situations in normal course.
(2) The age of the accused is a relevant consideration but not a
determinative factor by itself.
(3) The chances of the accused of not indulging in commission of the crime
again and the probability of the accused being reformed and rehabilitated.
(4) The condition of the accused shows that he was mentally defective and
the defect impaired his capacity to appreciate the circumstances of his criminal
conduct.
(5) The circumstances which, in normal course of life, would render such a
behaviour possible and could have the effect of giving rise to mental imbalance in
that given situation like persistent harassment or, in fact, leading to such a peak
of human behaviour that, in the facts and circumstances of the case, the
accused believed that he was morally justified in committing the offence.
(6) Where the court upon proper appreciation of evidence is of the view that
the crime was not committed in a preordained manner and that the death
resulted in the course of commission of another crime and that there was a
possibility of it being construed as consequences to the commission of the
primary crime.
(7) Where it is absolutely unsafe to rely upon the testimony of a sole
eyewitness though the prosecution has brought home the guilt of the accused.
(para 83)
Aggravating circumstances as pointed out above, of course, are not exhaustive
so also the mitigating circumstances. The tests that have to be applied by the
courts, while awarding death sentence are "crime test", "criminal test" and the "R-R
test" and not the "balancing test". To award death sentence, the "crime test" has
to be fully satisfied, that is, 100% and "criminal test" 0%, that is, no mitigating
circumstance favouring the accused. If there is any circumstance favouring the
accused, like lack of intention to commit the crime, possibility of reformation, young
age of the accused, not a menace to the society, no previous track record, etc. the
"criminal test" may favour the accused to avoid the capital punishment. Even if both
the tests are satisfied, that is, the aggravating circumstances to the fullest extent
and no mitigating circumstances favouring the accused, still the courts have to
apply finally the rarest of the rare case test (R-R test). R-R test depends upon the
perception of the society that is "society-centric" and not "Judge-centric", that is,
whether the society will approve the awarding of death sentence to certain types of
crimes or not. While applying that test, the court has to look into variety of factors
like society's abhorrence, extreme indignation and antipathy to certain types
of crimes like sexual assault and murder of intellectually challenged minor
girls, suffering from physical disability, old and infirm women with those
disabilities, etc. Examples are only illustrative and not exhaustive. The courts
award death sentence since situation demands so, due to constitutional
compulsion, reflected by the will of the people and not the will of the Judges.
(Para 84)
The law laid down by various decisions of the Supreme Court clearly and
unequivocally mandates that the probability (not possibility or improbability or
impossibility) that a convict can be reformed and rehabilitated in society must be
seriously and earnestly considered by the courts before awarding the death
sentence. This is one of the mandates of the "special reasons" requirement of
Section 354(3) CrPC and ought not to be taken lightly since it involves snuffing out
the life of a person. To effectuate this mandate, it is the obligation on the
prosecution to prove to the court, through evidence, that the probability is that the
convict cannot be reformed or rehabilitated. This can be achieved by bringing on
record, inter alia, material about his conduct in jail, his conduct outside jail if he has
been on bail for some time, medical evidence about his mental make-up, contact
with his family and so on. Similarly, the convict can produce evidence on these
issues as well.
(Para 88)
In the sentencing process, both the crime and the criminal are equally important.
Therefore, the Supreme Court should not forget that the criminal, however ruthless
he might be, is nevertheless a human being and is entitled to a life of dignity
notwithstanding his crime. Therefore, it is for the prosecution and the courts to
determine whether such a person, notwithstanding his crime, can be reformed and
rehabilitated. To obtain and analyse this information is certainly not an easy task
but must nevertheless be undertaken. The process of rehabilitation is also not a
simple one since it involves social reintegration of the convict into society. Of
course, notwithstanding any information made available and its analysis by experts
coupled with the evidence on record, there could be instances where the social
reintegration of the convict may not be possible. If that should happen, the option
of a long duration of imprisonment is permissible.

(Cri) 420, relied on
:
(1972), held, distinguished
So far the trial court is concerned, in the present case, it had scrupulously carried
out its duty in terms of Section 235(2) CrPC. The judgment of conviction was
pronounced on 28-9-2013 and the question of sentence was taken up 3 clear days
later i.e. on 1-10-2013; and the death sentence was awarded only after duly
hearing the appellant-accused, after duly taking into consideration the aggravating
and mitigating factors, and while duly recording special reasons.
(Para 107)
The heinous nature of the crime, like that of the present one, in brutal rape and
killing of a mentally and physically challenged girl, who was only about seven-and-a-
half-year-old, definitely carries excessively aggravating circumstances, particularly
when the manner of commission of both the major offences of rape and murder
shows depravity of highest order and would ex facie shock anyone's conscience.
The horrific manner of killing the victim, by causing ghastly head injuries had been
nothing less than beastly conduct of the appellant. However, as noticed, gruesome
nature of the action and the crime, by itself, may not be decisive, particularly as
regards the question of capital punishment. Thus, the court needs to cautiously
examine the other relevant factors, particularly those of the tests pertaining to the
criminal himself.
(Para 108)
Undoubtedly, the appellant was 28 years of age at the time of commission of
crime and was having family comprising of his wife, an eight-year-old daughter and
parents. He is not shown to be coming from any affluent background but, at the
same time, it is also not shown if he comes from a very poor socio-economic
background. Taken as a whole, these factors of the age, family and socio-economic
background of the appellant are not so clinching as to overwhelm and override the
aggravating factors.
(Para 109)
Then, the pertinent question is as to whether there exists a reasonable
probability of reformation and rehabilitation of the appellant? If the answer to this
material question is in the affirmative, it may have bearing upon the test to find if
the case falls in the rarest of the rare category. But, if there are factors which
operate against affirmative answer to this question on the probability of
reformation and rehabilitation, the aggravating circumstances would assuredly
outweigh the mitigating circumstances warranting capital punishment.
(Para 110)
The facts surfacing on record make it clear that the crime in question was not
the singular criminal activity of the appellant. The antecedents of the appellant
depict a person whose conduct had not been free from blemish and, in any case, he
committed the crimes of kidnapping as also murder of the victim girl with the use of
a vehicle which did not belong to him but was a stolen one. In other words, the
past of the appellant before the present case had been of involvement in criminal
cases; and abhorrent crimes of the present case were committed by him with the
aid of a stolen vehicle. These facts and factors magnify the aggravating
circumstances manifold.
(Para 112)
In view of what has been noticed hereinabove, the net result of crime test and
criminal test could be summarised as follows : The present case had been of
extreme inhumane acts and actions of the appellant where, amongst other
offending acts and actions, he:
(1) kidnapped the victim girl, who was only 7 1/2 years of age, who was even
otherwise a mentally and physically challenged child, with betrayal of trust when
the victim girl got lured with confectionary items given by him;
(2) brutally raped the victim girl, as noticeable from the gruesome injuries on
and around her private parts and as established by the medical officers who
conducted post-mortem; and
(3) mercilessly killed the victim girl by causing horrid injuries on her head, as
established not only by the doctors but also by the surrounding facts, including
bloodstains on the scene of crime, on the motorcycle, and on the clothing of the
appellant at the time of his arrest.
On the personal score, even though the appellant was about 28 years of age
and was having the family of wife, a daughter who was also about 8 years of age
and aged parents, he was continuously involved in criminal activities. Even if the
other past cases are left aside, he committed the crimes in question by using a
stolen motorcycle. Unfortunately, the matter does not end here.
(Para 113)
The tremors thrown by the appellant to shock anyone's conscience with his
beastly conduct have not stopped even with this inhumane crime and even after his
conviction.
(Para 114)
As noticed, in a substantial number of cases, when nothing further exacerbates
the crime in question, the courts have refrained from awarding or approving death
sentence even in the cases of gruesome killings, essentially on the premise that
even a semblance of probability of reformation of the convict ought to be given a
chance, rather than awarding capital punishment, which is of irretrievable nature. In
this regard, the jail conduct of the convict carries its own bearing and relevance in
the overall consideration; and the Supreme Court has leaned in favour of
commuting the sentence of death to that of imprisonment for life in case of
unblemished jail conduct, even if the crime itself had been of gruesome or
abhorrent nature. However, in the present case, the further shocking and disturbing
factor is that even while in jail, the appellant's conduct has not been free from
blemish where, apart from quarrelling with other inmate on 17-4-2015 and earning
7 days' punishment, the appellant had been accused and convicted of the offence of
yet another murder, this time of a co-inmate of the jail, while joining hands with
three other inmates.
(Para 115)
A perusal of the material placed on record makes it clear that the appellant, with
three other jail inmates, has been convicted by the trial court of the offence under
Sections 302/34 IPC for murder of another jail inmate, who was a Pakistani
national in the high security cell of the prison; and that the appellant has been
awarded the sentence of imprisonment for life. Though it has been pointed out that
an appeal against the said decision is pending and the Supreme Court would not be
making any comments on the merits of that case at all but, the appellant's culpable
conduct in jail compels the Supreme Court to ponder over the question as to
whether it would be realistic to believe on the probability of his reformation and
rehabilitation yet.
(Para 116)
The quest for justice in such cases, with death sentence being awarded and
maintained only in extreme cases, does not mean that the matter would be
approached and examined in the manner that death sentence has be avoided, even
if the matter indeed calls for such a punishment. The judicial process would be
compromising on its objectivity if the approach is to nullify the statutory provision
carrying death sentence as an alternative punishment for major offences (like that
of Section 302 IPC), even after it has passed muster of judicial scrutiny and has
been held not unconstitutional. The pursuit in collecting mitigating circumstances
could also not be taken up with any notion or idea that somehow, some factor be
found; or if not found, be deduced anyhow so that the sentence of death be
forsaken. Such an approach would be unrealistic, unwarranted and rather not
upholding the rule of law.
(Para 117)
An attempt has been made to suggest on behalf of the appellant that his overall
conduct in prison is without any blemish except the allegation of his involvement in
a case of murder. The Supreme Court could only wonder what more of criminal
activity would qualify as blemish, if not the involvement and conviction in a case of
murder of a fellow jail inmate! This is apart from the other 7 days' punishment
earned by the appellant for quarrelling with another jail inmate.
(Para 118)
In appropriate cases, after conviction, the Court may call for report to determine
whether the accused could be reformed or rehabilitated; and it would depend on
the facts and circumstances of each case. Again, there cannot be any universal
formula for calling for a report. For example, in the present case, where the
appellant is found to be indulging incessantly in criminal activities before the crime in
question; has carried out gruesome deeds of the present crime; has further been
involved in questionable jail conduct, including quarrelling with a fellow inmate and
earning 7 days' punishment; and then, to cap it all, has been involved in an offence
of no less degree than murder of another jail inmate, calling for any further report
of the likelihood of reformation and rehabilitation of the appellant could be proposed
only if the judicial process is determined to annul the death sentence altogether, by
finding one way or the other to avoid the same in every case. Such an approach
would be counter-productive to the entire system of maintenance of order in the
society; and could be countenanced only if the Supreme Court would be inclined to
think that whatever be the society's cry for justice, the statutory provision of death
sentence should itself be given its interment or burial. Obviously, this approach
would be squarely contrary to the statutory mandates as also the principles
enunciated by multiple Constitution Bench decisions of the Supreme Court; and
would strike at the roots of the rule of law. In the given set of circumstances of this
case, the suggestions about calling for any so-called psychological evaluation report
could only be termed as impractical and unrealistic and could only be rejected.
(Para 120)
In the present case, where all the elements surrounding the offence as also all
the elements surrounding the offender cut across the balance sheet of aggravating
and mitigating circumstances, the Supreme Court is clearly of the view that there is
absolutely no reason to commute the sentence of death to any other sentence of
lesser degree. Even the alternative of awarding the sentence of imprisonment for
whole of the natural life with no remission does not appear justified in view of the
nature of crimes committed by the appellant and looking to his incorrigible conduct.
Hence, the death sentence is confirmed.

Criminal Trial - Circumstantial Evidence - Generally
Held :
The following conditions must be fulfilled before a case against an accused can
be said to be fully established when it is based solely on circumstantial evidence:
(1) the circumstances from which the conclusion of guilt is to be drawn
should be fully established. The circumstances concerned "must or should" and
not "may be" established. There is not only a grammatical but a legal distinction
between "may be proved" and "must be or should be proved". Certainly, it is a
primary principle that the accused must be and not merely may
The surest way t to legal research!"
be guilty before a court can convict and the mental distance between "may be" and
"must be" is long and divides vague conjectures from sure conclusions.
(2) the facts so established should be consistent only with the hypothesis of
the guilt of the accused, that is to say, they should not be explainable on any
other hypothesis except that the accused is guilty,
(3) the circumstances should be of a conclusive nature and tendency,
(4) they should exclude every possible hypothesis except the one to be
proved, and
(5) there must be a chain of evidence so complete as not to leave any
reasonable ground for the conclusion consistent with the innocence of the
accused and must show that in all human probability the act must have been
done by the accused.
These five golden principles constitute the panchsheel of the proof of a case
based on circumstantial evidence.
(Para 51)
The contention as to non-mentioning of the appellant in the missing person
report is, however, totally detached from reality as also from the factual matrix. It
has been consistently maintained that the appellant kidnapped the victim girl at
about 6.30 p.m. from the vending cart of victim's mother PW 1 K. It has been
proved by all the relevant witnesses that the attempts were made to chase the
appellant but he could not be stopped. Though no such report made in writing at
police post is on record but, even if it be assumed that they first went to the said
police post (as stated by victim's grandfather PW 3 M), so far giving the name of
the appellant as the person kidnapping the child is concerned, PW 3 had been
specific that his name was known to them and was given to the police post too.
Reference to some report at the said police post carries hardly any adverse impact
on the prosecution case because the information stated in the form of complaint by
PW 1 accompanied by PW 3 was indeed recorded in writing by PW 19 at 8.15 p.m.
at the police station. It has been established that the police station was at a
distance of about 7 km from the place of kidnapping. It has also been pointed out
by PW 1 that it took about 30 to 45 minutes to reach the police station in an auto
and the oral report was made at 8.15 p.m. In view of the specific facts stated in
unison by the relevant prosecution witnesses that the name and identity of the
kidnapper was known to them, coupled with the time that elapsed from the
moment of kidnapping (around 6.30 p.m.) and until lodging of the report at the
police station (around 8.15 p.m.) while providing for commuting time, there was
neither any occasion nor any reason for the prosecution witnesses to omit the
name of the appellant.
(Para 53.1)
The report (Ext. P-1) and the FIR registered on its basis (Ext. P-2) had been
specific, not only giving the name of the appellant (though in the report, the name
given was M and not MP) but further to that, the informant also stated her
knowledge that the person concerned was the one who was earlier living in the
Housing Board Colony. In the face of the contents of the report, Ext. P-1 and the
FIR, Ext. P-2 as also the consistent testimony of PWs 1, 2, 3, 5 and 17, who stated
in no uncertain terms that it was the appellant who kidnapped the victim girl, the
contention urged on behalf of the appellant could only be rejected. Moreover,
PW 12 has established a crucial fact that around the very same time as that of
kidnapping of the victim girl, the appellant reached the liquor shop and purchased
beer while a girl child was sitting on his motorcycle. The testimony of this witness
has also remained unshaken in the cross-examination. The appellant has not been
able to show as to why this independent witness would at all be deposing against
him. The appellant has further failed to explain if the girl child sitting on his
motorcycle at the time of purchasing beer from the shop of PW 12 RS was not the
victim girl but anyone else.
(Para 53.2)
Thus, the evidence on record is categorical and clear that the victim girl was last
seen alive only with the appellant.
(Para 53.3)
As regards another contention about the doubts on collection of blood samples
from the metal surface of the motorcycle in question because of the alleged rain or
drizzling or storm, first of all it may be mentioned that there had not been any
specific evidence about any excessive rain in the nature of storm. It has, of course,
been stated by the witnesses that at the time of kidnapping of the victim girl, it was
raining/drizzling. However, there is no such evidence that at the time of arrest of
the appellant, or at the time of his disclosure statement at about 2.00 a.m. on 18-
1-2013, or at the time of recovery of dead body at about 3.15 a.m. on 18-1-
2013, or at the time of recovery of motorcycle at about 4.45 p.m. on 19-1-2013,
or at the time of collection of blood sample from the motorcycle at about 5.00
p.m. on 19-1-2013, there had been any such rain or drizzle for which, the requisite
samples could not have been collected. This is apart from the fact that FSL had
clearly and undoubtedly performed DNA test on the blood sample collected from
motorcycle (packet marked D, Ext. 6 in the FSL report Ext. P-51). Thus, the
submission doubting the collection of blood sample from the motorcycle is also
totally baseless and stands rejected.
(Para 55)
Thus, factors established beyond doubt on record forming the complete chain of
circumstances are:
(a) the deceased was seven-and-a-half-year-old mentally and physically
challenged girl;
(b) the deceased was last seen with the appellant when he kidnapped her
from the lawful guardianship of her parents;
(c) the appellant was arrested within about 7 1/2 hours of kidnap;
(d) the clothes worn by the appellant were bloodstained, which were seized
and sealed;
(e) after about 1 1/2 hours of his arrest, the dead body of the victim girl was
recovered at a faraway place on the disclosure and information of the appellant;
(f) the motorcycle used by the appellant and the frock worn by the victim girl
were also recovered at a faraway place at the disclosure and information of the
appellant;
(g) the appellant failed to account for his own whereabouts as also the
whereabouts of the victim girl since after the time of kidnap;
(h) the appellant also failed to show the reason of his knowledge about the
place/places where the dead body, the motorcycle and the frock were
recovered;
(i) as per the evidence on record, it had been a case of brutal rape (with
gruesome injuries on and around private parts) and merciless killing (with horrific
injuries on head) of the victim girl;
(j) the victim died due to the injuries on her head;
(k) the DNA profile of blood collected from the person and clothing of the
victim girl matched with the DNA profile of blood found on the coat, pants and
shirt of the appellant and on the motorcycle.
This chain is so complete in itself that no stretch of imagination could take us to
any other hypothesis except the guilt of the appellant in relation to the offences
charged. Hence, the concurrent findings of the trial court and the High Court holding
the appellant guilty are imminently just and proper; and call for no interference
whatsoever.
(Para 58)
There are at least two other facts established on record which not only
strengthen the complete chain of circumstances noticed above but, have their own
bearing in this matter. The first one of these facts, which is duly attached to the
chain of circumstances, is that the motorcycle used in this crime bearing
Registration No. RJ30 3M 5944 was itself stolen on 14-1-2013 for which, a theft
report had already been lodged, as distinctly proved by PW 23, Sub-Inspector of
Police. It has been duly established on record that the appellant indeed used that
motorcycle in kidnapping the victim girl and the motorcycle was recovered as per
the information supplied by the appellant. It has not been a case of the appellant
that the motorcycle belonged to him or was given to him by its owner. Thus,
undoubtedly, the appellant used stolen motorcycle in committing this crime. The
second one of these facts, duly established by the testimony of PW 12 RS, had
been that after kidnapping the victim girl from the lawful guardianship of her
parents, the appellant headed towards the liquor shop with the victim girl sitting on
the motorcycle; he purchased a bottle of been and he even quarrelled as regards
the price; and he left the liquor shop with a bottle of beer and with the victim girl
sitting on the motorcycle. These facts and factors only worsen the criminality of
conduct duly found proved against the appellant.
(Para 59)
For what has been discussed hereinabove, there is not an iota of doubt that the
present case of circumstantial evidence answers to the panchsheel principles stated
above. The appellant was rightly convicted by the trial court and his conviction has
rightly been maintained by the High Court.

conviction, as a safeguard against routine capital sentencing, keeping in mind the

doubt was never accepted by the US Supreme Court - Held, the cases in which
theory of residual doubt has at all been referred to, stand on their own facts, where
alternative to death sentence was considered appropriate
Held :
Even in the case where conviction is based on circumstantial evidence, capital
punishment could be awarded but the Supreme Court had been increasingly
applying the theory of "residual doubt", which effectively creates a higher standard
of proof over and above the "beyond reasonable doubt" standard used at the stage
of conviction, as a safeguard against routine capital sentencing, keeping in mind the
irreversibility of death.
(Para 99)
Though, death penalty is not entirely impermissible to be awarded in
circumstantial evidence cases but the circumstantial evidence ought to be of
unimpeachable character with option of lesser sentence foreclosed.
(Para 100)
When it comes to cases based on circumstantial evidence in our jurisprudence,
the standard that is adopted in terms of law laid down by the Supreme Court is that
the circumstances must not only be individually proved or established, but they
must form a consistent chain, so conclusive as to rule out the possibility of any
other hypothesis except the guilt of the accused. On the strength of these
principles, the burden in such cases is already of a greater magnitude. Once that
burden is discharged, it is implicit that any other hypothesis or the innocence of the
accused, already stands ruled out when the matter is taken up at the stage of
sentence after returning the finding of guilt. So, theoretically the concept or theory
of "residual doubt" does not have any place in a case based on circumstantial
evidence. As a matter of fact, the theory of residual doubt was never accepted by
the US Supreme Court.
(Para 101)
Thus, in the case based on circumstantial evidence, the conclusion of guilt is
recorded only after the circumstances are found to be forming an unbreakable
chain, so consistent as to rule out any other hypothesis except the guilt of the
accused. These being stringent norms, as followed consistently by the courts based
596, and requirement being of the proof of the case beyond reasonable doubt,
theoretically there is no scope for any "residual doubt" operating even in the cases
of circumstantial evidence. The cases in which theory of residual doubt has at all
been referred, had been standing on their own facts, where alternative to death
sentence was considered appropriate. However, while taking up the matter for
sentencing, it is not expected to reopen the chain of circumstantial evidence to find
any weak link which may fall in the category of residual doubt. Needless to reiterate
that if at all any such doubt is reasonably existing, the very basis of conviction
would be in question. To put it in other words, after the final conclusion on the guilt
and after pronouncing conviction, no concept of residual doubt as such is available
for the purpose of sentencing.

Held :
The post-mortem report (Ext. P-35), as reproduced hereinbefore leaves nothing
to doubt that the hapless victim sustained extensive injuries all over her body and
the injuries particularly on her head as also on the private parts had been rather
horrific. Her death ultimately had been due to head injuries, as opined by the
doctors of the Medical Board. The expressions "brutal", "inhuman", "cruel", etc.
came in statement of doctor with reference to the Court question, where she was
asked her expert medical opinion after conducting external and internal examination
of injuries and after analysing the circumstances and condition of
body; and she opined with reference to the injuries that "the eight-year-old
innocent girl had been brutally and inhumanly raped and on objecting, the person
who raped her behaved in an inhuman and cruel manner as a result of which, she
sustained different simple and grievous injuries due to which she died". She further
pointed out her opinion about brutality while stating that "laceration of the vagina of
the deceased shows that she was brutally raped in an inhuman manner". However,
in her further cross-examination, this witness categorically affirmed the opinion
stated by the Medical Board in the post-mortem report about the cause of death
and clearly stated that "the cause of death was injury caused on the head". In the
given set of circumstances and cogent expert medical evidence, the absence of
semen on the body of the victim or in the vaginal swab is hardly of any bearing on
the substance of the matter. Hence, the contentions urged on behalf of the
appellant in relation to the medical evidence remain baseless and stand rejected. In
continuity, the submissions suggestive of the victim having received only bruises
and abrasions apart from injury on head are also incorrect. A bare reference to the
extensive post-mortem report (Ext. P-35) and the statements of the doctors of
the Medical Board PWs 14, 15 and 21 is sufficient to reject these suggestions.
(Para 54)
Apart from the above, one line occurring in the deposition of PW 21 Dr CV has
been picked up to build an argument on behalf of the appellant that the death of the
victim girl might have been caused as a result of rape; and it has been submitted
that causing death cannot be taken to be the intention of the appellant. The
argument is premised on a wrong and incomplete reading of the statement of PW
21 Dr CV. She too had been categorical in her examination-in-chief about the post-
mortem report and had deposed consistently with PW 14 Dr M and PW 15 Dr K that
as per Medical Board, the head injury was the cause of death. She reasserted this
fact in her cross-examination too, while stating that "in the opinion of Medical
Board, multiple injuries were found on the head of the deceased which collectively
resulted in death of the deceased". She had, of course, stated in her examination-in
-chief that "the deceased was subjected to brutal rape and her death was caused"
but, reading her testimony as a whole, it is but clear that in this sentence, what she
intended to convey was about two different acts i.e. of committing rape and of
causing death. She had not stated that death was caused by rape.
(Para 54.1)
Having examined the post-mortem report and the testimonies of the doctors
conducting post-mortem, even by distortion of language occurring in their
testimonies, it cannot be deduced that there was any doubt or difference of opinion
in the Medical Board about the cause of death. In other words, the doctors had
been clear, categorical and consistent that the victim girl died due to the injuries
caused on her head.

I. Penal Code, 1860 - Ss. 302, 363, 365 and 376(2)(f) - Kidnapping,
rape and murder of a physically and mentally challenged 71/2-yr-old girl -
Challenge as to mental and physical disabilities of the victim - Held, not
sustainable, when the same supported by medical evidence on record and,
there held no merit in the defence contention that the certificate issued
from school to prove her mental calibre could not be relied upon because the
person who issued such certificate was never examined - Crimes Against
Women and Children - Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act,
2012, S. 6
Held :
The other submission seeking to question the factum of mental and physical
disabilities of the victim girl does not carry any substance at all. Apart from the fact
that mental and physical disabilities of the child have been consistently stated by her
parents and grandfather, the fact of the matter remains that way back on 4-3-
2010, the Medical Board found her suffering from spastic palsy (vide Ext. P-11);
and PW 18 Dr N indeed proved the said certificate. In fact, the investigating officer
PW 25 took care to seek medical opinion/comments regarding the nature of
disablement of the victim girl with reference to the said certificate Ext. P-11 by way
of a communication dated 22-1-2013 (Ext. 52) and thereupon, the Medical Officer
made his endorsement to the effect that "her coordination movements of limbs
which are controlled by brain were disturbed and as such she was physically and
mentally challenged child". The submissions as regards evidentiary value of school
certificates carry no meaning when the matter is examined with reference to the
overall evidence on record, which leaves nothing to doubt that the victim girl was a
mentally and physically challenged child. Percentage of disablement is not the
matter in issue here. The relevant facts are that she was suffering from mental and
physical disabilities and was below 8 years of age. These facts are duly proved on
record.

impartiality and false implication regarding collection of various kinds of
evidence against appellant-accused - When not tenable
- As per prosecution, appellant came on his motorcycle and kidnapped a
physically and mentally challenged 71/2-yr-old girl and thereafter took her to a
secluded place, committed rape upon her and killed her by causing injuries on her
head - Prosecution claimed to have recovered dead body at the instance of
accused - Contention raised by the appellant that after finding him at the bus-
stand, the police along with the father of the deceased, took him directly to the
police station, recorded his confession and thereafter took him to the spot where
the body of the deceased was found, instead of enquiring from him the
whereabouts of the deceased
- Appellant further contended that the unusual collecting of evidence in relation
to other cases and overt reliance on personal opinion of doctors about the manner
of commission of offence, established that the investigation was not impartial,
where final report was submitted within 12 days of the appellant's arrest, even
before receiving the DNA report
- Material indicated that the information referable to S. 27 of the Evidence Act
as furnished by the appellant was duly recorded by the IO and, thereafter, he was
taken to the location of the dead body and the same was recovered as per the said
information furnished by the appellant - Resultantly, there held no substance in the
contention against the process taken up by the IO after the arrest of the appellant
- Similarly, held, there was no unusual manner in which evidence against the
appellant was collected for other cases, as last one of the other cases against the
appellant was of theft of the very same motorcycle, which was used in the present
crime
- Similarly, contentions against the process of investigation, about placing
reliance on the personal opinion of doctors, held, very difficult to be appreciated,
particularly when the doctors of the Medical Board were rather under bounden duty
to state their opinion, particularly as regards the nature and duration of injuries and
the cause of death - Challenge as to submission of final report being submitted
within 12 days of the appellant's arrest, even before receiving the DNA report, also
held not material

(Paras 48.2 and 48.3)
Held :
The suggestions that the charge-sheet was filed within 12 days of his arrest and
even without receipt of DNA report and that the appellant should have been given
more time to study the police report stand rather at conflict with the desirability of
prompt proceedings by the investigating agency and also by the trial court in such
matters. The constitutional guarantees of equality before law, protection of life and
personal liberty, protection in respect of conviction, and protection against the
arrest and detention, do not expand into a corresponding right with an accused
person to question the swiftness of investigation and expeditious proceedings of the
trial or to suggest that he has to be tried at a pace of his choice. It sounds rather
preposterous that an accused would question the trial proceedings only because of
the pace maintained by the prosecution and the trial court so as to take the trial to
its logical conclusion at the earliest. While rejecting the contentions urged on behalf
of the appellant, the Supreme Court would rather observe that the speed and pace
expected in the cases like the present one, per force, require utmost expedition by
the investigating agency as also by the trial court.

Right of defence - Plea by accused as to depriving him of such right - Held,

to defend the appellant and thoroughly cross-examined each and every
witness to the minutest and minor details - Constitution of India - Art. 22
(1) - Criminal Procedure Code, 1973, S. 304
Held :
The contention that the appellant was deprived of his right of defence and he
was given services of an inexperienced counsel remain too far-stretched and rather
unjustified. Apart from that no such grievance was ever suggested before the trial
court or even before the High Court, the legal aid counsel was appointed at the
request of the appellant himself and in fact, the trial court proceeded with the
matter only after appointment of a counsel for the appellant. A perusal of the
record further makes it clear that the legal aid counsel left no stone unturned to
defend the appellant and thoroughly cross-examined each and every witness to the
minutest and minor details. He contested every proposition of the prosecution and
even the application for recalling of PW 1 (only for the purpose of identification of
the clothes of the deceased, which were received later from FSL) was also
thoroughly contested by him by filing a reply and contending that the prosecution
was trying to fill up a lacuna in their case. Hereinbefore, the Supreme Court has
referred to the extensive contentions urged on behalf of the appellant-accused by
the legal aid counsel, as dealt with by the trial court in its judgment dated 28-9-
2013.
(Para 48.4)
Having examined the record, the criticism in this appeal against the conduct of
case by the legal aid counsel is unwarranted and rather unfair. The said counsel had
indeed faithfully discharged his duties and had thoroughly defended the appellant. As
regards the defence version, it has not been shown if the appellant ever suggested
to the counsel about his desire to have one or more meetings with him or to confer
with him about any particular line of defence. We are constrained to observe that
the negative comments qua the said legal aid counsel cannot be countenanced and
raising of such contentions in this appeal is difficult to be appreciated; these
contentions are rejected in toto.

- Reiterated, as held in Bachan Singh case, it is not possible to hold that the
provision of death penalty as an alternative punishment for murder, in S. 302 is
unreasonable and not in the public interest and, thus, the impugned provision in S.
302, violates neither the letter nor the ethos of Art. 19 of the Constitution
- Further, as held in Bachan Singh case expanded and read for interpretative
purposes, Art. 21 of the Constitution, held, clearly brings out the implication, that
the Founding Fathers recognised the right of the State to deprive a person of his life
or personal liberty in accordance with fair, just and reasonable procedure
established by valid law - Further, considering relevant constitutional postulates,
death penalty under S. 302, held, neither per se nor because of its execution by
hanging, constitutes an unreasonable, cruel or unusual punishment
- Further, the provision in S. 302 IPC as held in Bachan Singh case, held, not
violative of Art. 14 of the Constitution on the ground that it confers on the Judges
an unguided and uncontrolled discretion in the matter of awarding capital
punishment or imprisonment for life
- Further, S. 302 as held in Bachan Singh case, held, valid for three main
reasons i.e. firstly, that the death sentence provided for by S. 302 is an alternative
to the sentence of life imprisonment, secondly, that special reasons as required
under S. 354(3) CrPC have to be stated if the normal rule is departed from and the
death sentence has to be imposed and, thirdly, because the accused is entitled,
under S. 235(2) CrPC, to be heard on the question of sentence

minimum non-remittable term of imprisonment i.e. with rider that the
convict shall not be released from prison for the rest of his life or shall not
be released before serving a particular term - When warranted
Held :
When an appellant comes to the Supreme Court carrying a death sentence
awarded by the trial court and confirmed by the High Court, the Supreme Court
may find that the case just falls short of the rarest of the rare category and may
feel
somewhat reluctant in endorsing the death sentence. But at the same time, having
regard to the nature of the crime, the Court may strongly feel that a sentence of
life imprisonment subject to remission normally works out to a term of 14 years
would be grossly disproportionate and inadequate. What then should the Court do?
If the Court's option is limited only to two punishments, one a sentence of
imprisonment, for all intents and purposes, of not more than 14 years and the
other death, the Court may feel tempted and find itself nudged into endorsing the
death penalty. Such a course would indeed be disastrous. A far more just,
reasonable and proper course would be to expand the options and to take over
what, as a matter of fact, lawfully belongs to the Court i.e. the vast hiatus between
14 years' imprisonment and death. It needs to be emphasised that the Court would
take recourse to the expanded option primarily because in the facts of the case, the
sentence of 14 years' imprisonment would amount to no punishment at all.
(Para 82)
A special category of sentence; instead of death can be substituted by the
punishment of imprisonment for life or for a term exceeding 14 years and put that
category beyond application of remission is well founded.

Held :
It is necessary to deal with the subjectivity involved in capital cases. The
imprecision of the identification of aggravating and mitigating circumstances has to
be minimised. It is to be noted that the mandate of equality clause applies to the
sentencing process rather than the outcome. The comparative review must be
undertaken not to channel the sentencing discretion available to the courts but to
bring in consistency in identification of various relevant circumstances. The
aggravating and mitigating circumstances have to be separately identified under a
rigorous measure.

A. Preliminary
1. Leave granted. These appeals are directed against the common
judgment and order dated 29-5-2015 in State of Rajasthan V. Manoj
Pratap Singh1 1 whereby, the High Court of Judicature for Rajasthan at
Jodhpur has affirmed the judgment of conviction dated 28-9-2013 and
order of sentencing dated 1-10-2013 in Sessions Case No. 12 of 2013,
as passed by the Court of Special Judge, Protection of Children from
Sexual Offences Cases, Rajsamand.
1.1. The High Court, while upholding conviction of the appellant for
the offences punishable under Sections 363, 365, 376(2)(f), 302 of the
Penal Code, 1860 (hereinafter also referred to as "IPC") and Section 6
of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012
(hereinafter also referred to as "Pocso"), has confirmed the death
sentence awarded to him by the trial court for the offence under
Section 302 IPC.
1.2. In addition to the sentence of death for the offence under
Section 302 IPC, the appellant has been awarded the punishments of
imprisonment for a term of 7 years and fine of Rs 25,000 for the
offence under Section 363 IPC; imprisonment for a term of 7 years and
fine of Rs 25,000 for the offence under Section 365 IPC; imprisonment
for life and a fine of Rs 50,000 for the offence under Section 376(2)(f)
IPC; and imprisonment for life and a fine of Rs 1,00,000 for the offence
under Section 6 Pocso. While providing for default stipulations of
further imprisonment in case of non-payment of fine amount, it has
also been provided that the fine amount shall be given to the mother of
the deceased girl as compensation.
2. In these appeals, the conviction of the appellant as also the
punishment awarded to him, particularly the capital punishment, are
under challenge. Before dealing with the relevant aspects in necessary
details, we may draw a brief sketch and outline of the matter.
3. The appellant has been accused of kidnapping a physically and
mentally challenged seven-and-a-half-year-old girl in front of her
parents from their fruit and vegetable vending cart; having thereafter
taken her to a secluded place; having committed rape upon her; and
having killed her by causing injuries on her head.
4. The prosecution case rested on circumstantial evidence to the
effect that the victim was lastly seen with the appellant when he took
her away; that the dead body of victim and other articles related with
the crime were recovered at the instance of the appellant; that the
appellant failed to satisfactorily explain his whereabouts and his
knowledge of the location of dead body; and that the medical and other
scientific evidence was consistent with the prosecution case. Thus,
according to the prosecution, the entire chain of events was complete
and was conclusive of the guilt of the appellant, excluding any other
hypothesis. Per contra, the appellant asserted that he was falsely
implicated, though he did not adduce any evidence in defence.
5. In its judgment dated 28-9-2013, the trial court convicted the
appellant of the offences aforesaid with the findings that the
prosecution had been able to substantiate the charges by proving
beyond doubt that the appellant kidnapped the victim girl, committed
rape and then murdered her and concealed the dead body. Then, on 1-
10-2013, after having heard the appellant-accused and the prosecution
The surest way t to legal research!
on the question of sentence, the trial court found no reason to take any
lenient view in the matter, particularly looking to the gruesome nature
of crime and thus, awarded varying punishments, including that of
death sentence under Section 302 IPC.
6. The sentence of death was submitted for confirmation to the High
Court in terms of Section 366 of the Criminal Procedure Code, 1973
("CrPC" for short). On the other hand, the appellant-accused preferred
an appeal against the judgment and order of the trial court. Both, the
reference case for confirmation of death sentence and the appeal
preferred by the appellant, were considered together and the High
Court, after finding that each and every incriminating circumstance had
clearly been established, affirmed the conviction. As regards the
question of sentence, the High Court, with reference to the nature of
offence, in brutal rape and murder of a seven-and-a-half-year-old
mentally and physically challenged girl along with the calculated
attempt to cover up the crime, found the present one to be "the rarest
of rare case" and, accordingly, confirmed the punishments awarded to
the appellant, including the sentence of death.
7. In the present appeals, conviction of the appellant has been
questioned essentially with the contentions that the investigation was
not impartial; that the trial was conducted in a hurried manner; that
proper legal aid with a counsel of sufficient experience was not provided
to the appellant; that probability of false implication cannot be ruled
out since the name of the appellant was not stated in the missing
person report; and that blood sample might not have been collected
from the motorcycle since, admittedly, it was raining heavily at the
relevant time. The sentence awarded to the appellant has also been put
to question, essentially with the submissions that awarding of sentence
both under IPC and Pocso is not sustainable; and that the trial court as
also the High Court have not properly examined the mitigating factors
existing in favour of the appellant, including the residual doubts in the
weak chain of circumstances. It is also submitted that in the hurriedly
conducted trial, the appellant was unable to effectively present his
case; and that the young age of the appellant, his poor socio-economic
background with family members being dependent on him, and the
likelihood of reformation deserve due consideration as mitigating
factors against capital punishment.
8. Per contra, it is contended on behalf of the respondent State that
the evidence of the witnesses related with the deceased is duly
corroborated by the testimony of independent witnesses; that the name
of the appellant finds mentioned in the missing person report as also in
the FIR; and that the forensic and medical evidence is consistent with
the case of the prosecution. It is also submitted that the abhorrent
nature of crime justifies awarding of death sentence in the present
case, where the appellant kidnapped a minor girl who was not of sound
physical and mental health; and committed brutal rape
and murder. It has also been submitted that the subsequent conduct of
the appellant in jail has been moreover questionable and he had killed
another inmate with stone for which, he has been further convicted of
the offence under Sections 302/34 IPC; and this demonstrates that the
appellant is a threat to the society.
9. Thus, two major points would arise for determination in these
appeals:
9.1. (1) First, as to whether conviction of the appellant calls for any
interference.
9.2. (2) Second, if conviction is maintained, as to whether the
sentence of death awarded to the appellant deserves to be affirmed or
deserves to be substituted by any other sentence?
10. With the aforesaid outline, we may take note of the relevant
factual and background aspects in necessary details.
B. Relevant factual and background aspects
11. The prosecution in the present case had its foundation in the oral
information stated in the form of complaint by PW 1 Kamla on 17-1-
2013 at about 8.15 p.m. at Police Station Kankroli, District Rajsamand
while being accompanied by her father PW 3 Madan Lal. The
complainant alleged that earlier in the day, she was at her fruit-
vegetable vending cart near R.K. Hospital with her husband PW 2
Dharam Das and her father PW 3 Madan Lal; that at around 6.30 p.m.,
Manoj Singh, who earlier lived in the nearby Housing Board Colony,
came to her cart on a motorcycle, purchased fruits and gave chocolates
to her 8-year-old mentally challenged daughter K2 and left; that he
returned to the cart after about 10 minutes, placed her daughter K on
his motorcycle and proceeded towards Somnath Chauraha; and that
attempts were made to chase him but he was not found. It was also
stated by the complainant that she could not note the registration
number of the motorcycle but the same was of sky-blue colour. The
complainant also described the features and attire of her daughter and
alleged that Manoj Singh had kidnapped her daughter.
11.1. The contents of the aforesaid oral complaint were reduced in
writing (Ext. P-1) by PW 19 Nand Lal, who was the officer-in-charge of
Police Station Kankroli at the relevant time [as the Station House
Officer ("SHO" for short) PW 20 Ganesh Nath was away] and,
accordingly, FIR No. 16 of 2013 (Ext. P-2) came to be registered for the
offence under Section 363 IPC.
11.2. The said PW 19 Nand Lal immediately commenced
investigation and recorded the statements of informant Kamla as also
of her father Madan Lal; informed the SHO; transmitted messages for
nakabandi; and also carried
out unsuccessful search at the Housing Board Colony and other places.
Thereafter, the SHO PW 20 Ganesh Nath took over investigation and
recorded the statement of Dharam Das, father of the victim girl; and in
view of the allegations, added the offence under Section 365 IPC.
11.3. All the proceedings aforesaid took place until midnight of 17-1
-2013. The SHO, thereafter, proceeded in search of the victim and the
offender while taking the said Madan Lal and Dharam Das with him.
Ultimately, the appellant-accused was found at the Old Bus-stand,
Kankroli, at about 2 a.m., who divulged his name and particulars as
Manoj Pratap Singh, son of Surendra Pratap Singh Rajput, resident of
Basantpur, Police Station Gugli, District Maharajganj, Uttar Pradesh. He
was taken to Police Station Kankroli, was arrested, and his clothes
carrying bloodstains were seized.
11.4. It has been the case of the prosecution that on being
questioned, the appellant stated that he had killed the girl whom he
kidnapped near R.K. Hospital and her dead body was lying near Kamal
Talai, which he could get recovered. The information so furnished by
the appellant was recorded (Ext. P-40); and the body of the deceased
was recovered at around 3.15 a.m. from a patari by the bridge at Kamal
Talai as per the disclosure of the appellant.
11.5. In view of the recovery of the dead body of K, the offence
under Section 302 IPC was added for investigation. The SHO prepared
the necessary memos and reports and sent the dead body for post-
mortem examination. In view of the post-mortem report indicating rape
with the victim, the offence under Section 376(2)(f) was also added.
The SHO also got the appellant-accused examined in relation to the
injuries on his body. In the meantime, investigation was transferred to
the Circle Officer, Rajsamand PW 25 Umesh Ojha. According to the
prosecution, the appellant-accused divulged more information on 19-1-
2013 about the location of motorcycle used in the crime as also the
place of committing the crime and the place where clothing of the
deceased was lying. This information was reduced in writing (Ext. P-48)
and in pursuance thereof, motorcycle bearing Registration No. RJ30 3M
5944 was recovered; the bloodstains on the motorcycle were collected;
the frock-like-skirt of the deceased was recovered; the place of incident
was identified; and bloodstained soil as also control soil were collected
and sealed. Further, the investigating officer got the appellant-accused
medically examined for sexual potency and his blood sample was also
collected. The collected articles/samples were sent for forensic science
laboratory ("FSL" for short) examination. The investigating officer
further collected the certificates relating to the date of birth of the
victim as also the certificates concerning her mental and physical
disablement.
11.6. The investigating officer also recorded the statements of
witnesses who had allegedly seen the appellant-accused taking the
victim girl on his motorcycle. Apart from other witnesses, PW 12
Ranjeet Singh, the salesman of a liquor shop, stated that the appellant-
accused came to his shop at about 6.30 p.m. with a girl sitting on the
motorcycle, purchased a bottle of beer and also quarrelled regarding
the price. As per the contents of charge-sheet,
the investigating officer also found, after carrying out background
verification, that the appellant-accused had been involved in a few
other criminal cases. Significantly, it was found that the said
motorcycle bearing Registration No. RJ30 3M 5944 was stolen from
Nathdwara on 14-1-2013 for which, an FIR bearing No. 39 of 2013 had
already been registered at Police Station Nathdwara for the offence
under Section 379 IPC.
11.7. In the post-mortem examination, the Medical Board found
varying injuries on the dead body of the victim, including those on head
and on private parts. The Medical Board opined that the cause of death
was head injury and that the deceased had been subjected to ante-
mortem rape.
11.8. After other processes of investigation, charge-sheet was filed
against the appellant on 2-2-2013 and the case was committed to the
Court of Session. At the request of the appellant-accused, legal aid was
provided to him from the District Legal Services Authority and the Court
heard the matter for framing of charge only after appointment of a legal
aid counsel. The appellant was charged of the offences under Sections
363, 365, 376(2)(f) and 302 IPC and Section 6 Pocso. The appellant
pleaded not guilty and claimed trial.
C. The evidence
12. In trial, the prosecution examined as many as 25 witnesses and
produced 52 documents. In view of the contentions raised and issues
involved, we may take note of the salient features of testimonies of
material witness as also relevant documentary evidence in requisite
details3.
13. There had been several non-official witnesses, including the
parents and grandfather of the victim girl child and other persons who
had testified to the factum of kidnapping of the victim girl by the
appellant and who had also been the part of investigation proceedings.
13.1. PW 1 Kamla, mother of the deceased child, deposed on the
basic and primary facts of this case in her examination-in-chief as
under:
"The incident is of 17-1-2013 at 6.30 p.m. I use to place my fruits
and vegetables cart outside R.K. Hospital, Rajsamand and hence, I
was there. My father Madan Lal and my husband Dharamdas were
also present there. At that time accused Manoj Pratap Singh, present
in Court, came to my cart to buy fruits. Name of my daughter is K
who is 8 years old. Accused Manoj Pratap Singh, present in the
Court, gave my daughter kurkure and chocolate on which we told
him not to do so but he gave these articles to my
daughter and left. After 10-15 minutes accused Manoj Pratap Singh
again came and took my daughter on motorcycle towards Somnath
Chouraha. At that time my father Madan Lal and husband Dharam Das
followed accused but they could not find him. Motorcycle was of sky-
blue colour. I had not seen the number of motorcycle. At that time my
daughter K was wearing a red kurta, pink colour jacket and black
legging. The colour of my daughter was fair and height 4 feet. We went
to police station. At that time my father also went along with me and
we gave a report in the police station.
The report is Ext. P-1 on which A to B are my signatures. FIR is
Ext. P-2 on which A to B are my signatures.
Then my father and my husband went along with police to search
my daughter. I was sitting where my lorry was near R.K. Hospital,
Rajsamand. In the night at 12.30 we came to know that accused
Manoj Pratap Singh had been found. Then we were called at the
police station. Accused Manoj Pratap Singh took my husband and
father to Kamal Talai where dead body of my daughter K was found.
Accused Manoj Pratap Singh was residing at Housing Board and
sometimes came to us to buy vegetables; therefore, I could identify
him. Accused Manoj Pratap Singh took my daughter and killed her."
13.2. On being cross-examined, this witness stated as under:
"At that time, accused Manoj Pratap Singh was wearing brown-
coloured jacket. On that day, we lodged a missing report of K. It is
true that my daughter K was mentally retarded. It is wrong to say
that my daughter had been missing once or twice before this
incident. It is wrong to say that my daughter used to go here and
there without informing me. I do not know where accused Manoj
Pratap Singh used to work. It is correct to say that I did not raise
any alarm when accused took my daughter because at that time
there was nobody nearby. I do not know the time of death of my
daughter. We went to the police station in the evening at 7.45 p.m.
The accused took away my daughter at 6.30 p.m. The police station
is located at a distance of about 7 km from the place of incident. We
hired an auto to the police station and it took about 30-45 minutes.
We lodged missing report of my daughter at the police station. It is
true that at the time of lodging the missing report, we did not
mention the name of accused Manoj Pratap Singh."
13.3. The aforesaid deposition of PW 1 Kamla was recorded on 5-4-
2013. At that point of time, clothing of the deceased had been with the
FSL and the same were received later in the trial court. The
prosecution, after completion of other evidence, moved an application
under Section 311 CrPC for further examination of this witness PW 1
Kamla, for the purpose of identification of the clothes of the deceased.
This application was duly contested by the learned counsel for the
appellant-accused with the submissions that such recalling of the
witness would be allowing the prosecution to fill up the lacunae in its
case. However, the trial court, by its considered order dated 26-8-2013,
accepted the
said application looking to its purpose and while indicating that the
accused would nevertheless have the opportunity of cross-examination.
This witness PW 1 Kamla was, accordingly, again examined on 4-9-
2013 where she stated about the attire of her daughter when she was
kidnapped by the appellant-accused and duly identified Article 1, being
the leggy (lower) as also Article 7, being the kurta (frock) of her
daughter K.
13.4. PW 2 Dharam Das, father of the deceased girl, corroborated
the testimony of PW 1 Kamla and stated that the appellant came and
took their daughter. He also stated that he was present when the
appellant was arrested from Kankroli Bus-stand, when the appellant
made a disclosure statement at the police station, and when the body
of his daughter was recovered at the instance of the appellant. This
witness also testified to various proceedings of recoveries and seizures
and identified his signatures on various memos like that of site
inspection, arrest of the appellant, recovery of the dead body, its
panchayatnama, etc. This witness further testified that his daughter
was 8 years of age and was mentally retarded; and exhibited the
relevant documents in that regard, being Exts. P-11 to P-14.
13.5. This witness (PW 2) was also thoroughly cross-examined
where he stated, inter alia, as under:
"I am hawker of fruits and vegetables. On the day of incident, I
was at the cart. That time I was selling vegetables to customers.
That time accused Manoj Pratap Singh was the customer who bought
fruits and went. It is wrong that thereafter accused Manoj Pratap did
not come to the cart. That time it was drizzling, therefore none else
was there. It is wrong that there were some more carts near my
carts; other carts were away from my cart. I do not know the names
of other cart owners. There is a milkman's shop, which is away from
my lorry. There are some carts of snacks but due to cold weather and
rainfall, there was no cart. We were about to go home after some
time, but accused Manoj Pratap Singh abducted and took away my
daughter. He lured by giving chocolate to my daughter. It is wrong
that I do not know accused Manoj Pratap Singh. He used to come to
my cart. It is wrong that my daughter went with accused with her
consent, but she was abducted by accused Manoj Pratap Singh. It is
true that K went with the accused Manoj Pratap Singh on being lured
by chocolate. I stopped my daughter but as she was feebleminded
and so, did not stop. It is true that at the time the accused abducted
and took away my daughter, nobody was there. That time accused
Manoj Pratap Singh was wearing check shirt and jacket. My daughter
was not wearing any footwear. On 17-1-2013 at night signature was
taken on memo, Ext. P-3. Then said, signature was taken on another
day. While signature was taken nobody was with me. Then said, my
father-in-law was also with me. My signature was taken on Ext. P-3
at police station. Then said signature was taken at Kamal Talai.
Signature was taken at different times which I do not remember.
The police officials did not read over and explain what was written on
the document. Then said that they read over and explained the
contents but do not remember the same
today. I am illiterate, I can only sign therefore, I do not know the
contents of memo Ext. P-4. It is wrong that when we went to the police
station, accused Manoj Pratap Singh was sitting in the police station. I
had said that he was sitting at bus-stand. Accused Manoj Pratap Singh
was arrested on the same night. It is wrong that police officials did not
seize clothes in front of me. The same were seized in the night of 17-1-
2013. I do not know what was written on jacket of accused Manoj
Pratap Singh. My daughter's dead body was found at Taledi Kamal
Talai. Dead body was lying at the bridge. Bruises were found on head
and all other parts of body of my daughter. It is wrong that injuries
were not found on the legs. It is wrong that police official took my
signature on memo at police station. Signature was taken at different
places such as police station and house. It is true that Ext. P-12 was
released after the incident. It is true that certificate, Ext. P-14 was also
released after the incident."
13.6. Father of the informant, PW 3 Madan Lal, also corroborated the
testimony of PW 1 Kamla and PW 2 Dharam Das as regards kidnapping
of the victim girl by the appellant, arrest of the appellant, his disclosure
statement at the police station, and the subsequent recovery of the
body of the victim girl at the instance of the appellant. He also deposed
regarding the memos of arrest, seizure, recoveries, and
panchayatnama, and identified his signatures on the memos Exts. P-5
to P-8. We may usefully extract the relevant part of statement made by
this witness in his cross-examination as follows:
"
At about 6.30 p.m., I reached the place of incident and stood
there. Accused Manoj Pratap Singh came to buy vegetables just after
me and thereafter some more customers came. About 15 feet away
from my son-in-law's cart, there were some more carts. Saras Milk
Dairy and Ayurvedic medicine shop is also there. Due to rainfall and
storm, there was nobody. That time accused Manoj Pratap Singh
bought fruits and vegetable, gave chocolate to the baby girl and
went. Then after 10-15 minutes he came back at 6.30 p.m. and
immediately took the child on his motorcycle and went away. Since
the child was feebleminded, she used to sit with anybody. We were
attending the customers. It is wrong that I have not seen the
accused abducting the child and the customers informed about the
abduction. Somnath Choraha is approximately 3-4 km away from the
place of incident. Baby girl's dead body was found at Kamal Talai
bridge. I do not know about the direction of Kamal Talai from the
place of incident. I could not see the accused Manoj Pratap Singh.
Then we went to the police post. We went to Bandiyabada Police Post
where missing report was lodged that the accused Manoj Pratap
Singh took away the child. Because we knew the name of Manoj
Pratap Singh, we gave his name in the report. I do not know the
name of father of accused Manoi Pratap Sinah. We went to search
accused Manoj Pratap Singh because the child was with him. We
reached police station at about 7.00-8.00 p.m. Two police jeeps
came out of the police station, one moved towards R.K. Hospital and
another moved towards bus-stand. In one of the jeeps, my daughter
Kamla and some police
officials went towards R.K. Hospital. In another jeep, Dharam Das,
some of the police officials went towards bus-stand. I was sitting on the
motorcycle of my colleague Manilal. Then we searched Dhoinda and
various other places in jeep but we were unable to find anyone, so we
returned to the police station and in second round, we went towards
bus-stand. In the first instance we went to Dhoinda via R.K.; it is
wrong that we went via Kamal Talai road, instead we went via bypass.
We met accused Manoj Pratap Singh present in the court when we went
to bus-stand in the second round. Accused Manoj Pratap Singh was
wearing jacket and jeans and at that time it was raining lightly.
Accused Manoj Pratap Singh was standing near the water kiosk. Nobody
was near him. Firstly, the police saw the accused Manoj Pratap Singh
with bloodstains on his clothes
Accused Manoj was brought to police
station in jeep and upon enquiry he disclosed that the child had been
left at Kamal Talai bridge. On one side of Kamal Talai bridge there was
a house whose name I do not remember and on the other side was a
cremation ground. Ext. P-3 site plan of the place of incident was
prepared at 7.00 a.m. At Kamal Talai, I signed at two or three places
It is true that, I have not seen anyone killing my granddaughter K."
13.7. PW 5 Maniraj Singh has been an independent witness to the
kidnapping of the victim girl, as also to the inquest report. He stated in
his examination-in-chief all the essential facts in corroboration of the
statements abovenoted. He also testified to the inquest report, seizure
memo and other memos concerning delivery of dead body, site plan of
Kamal Talai and site plan of the place of kidnapping. In his cross-
examination, this witness stated, inter alia, as under:
"
The place of incident is 200 to 300 ft away from my office. On
the day of incident other carts were open. I do not remember the
name of carts which were open. I know deceased K. It is wrong that
I did not see K when she was abducted. That time we did not know
that accused Manoj Pratap Singh is abducting the child; therefore we
did not prevent him from doing so. It is wrong that K willingly sat on
the motorcycle of the accused, instead the accused caught her and
made her sit in front seat of his motorcycle. I did not know that
accused is abducting the child; therefore I did not stop him. It is
correct that at that time other persons were also standing at the fruit
cart. It is correct that other persons who were standing at the fruit
cart did not stop him. It is possible that in my police statement, I
have stated that the colour of the motorcycle was sky blue but in my
statement the colour of the motorcycle has been written as green. It
is correct that I am off duty at 5.00 p.m. It is true that I have
motorcycle, and I am using it to go to my office. It is correct that at
that time I did not try to follow accused Manoj Pratap Singh because
my motorcycle was parked at some distance. I do not know about
employment of accused Manoj Pratap Singh. I know accused Manoj
Pratap Singh as I used to see him at that place for past two to four
months. I do not have any special identification of accused Manoj
Pratap Singh. It is wrong that someone dictated me the name of
accused
Manoj Pratap Singh. The place of incident is opposite to the place from
where the dead body of K was recovered. Accused Manoj Pratap Singh
took away K towards Somnath Choraha which is in another direction.
There were injuries on right eye below eyebrows and behind the head
above the neck of the deceased K It is wrong that my signature
was
taken on all the memos at the same time. Then said whatever memos
were prepared were signed by him after reading. I do not remember
the colour of the clothes that the accused Manoj Pratap Singh was
wearing at the time of incident."
13.8. PW 17 Dinesh Bhatia had been another witness to the
kidnapping of the deceased. He is brother of PW 2 Dharam Das, and
has a tea stall behind the cart of PW 1 Kamla. He too corroborated the
testimonies of PW 1 Kamla, PW 2 Dharam Das, PW 3 Madan Lal and PW
5 Maniraj Singh.
13.9. One more independent witness, in regard to the fact that the
deceased girl was last seen with the appellant, had been PW 12 Ranjeet
Singh. He was the salesman at a liquor shop, where the appellant
stopped to purchase beer immediately after taking the victim girl on his
motorcycle. This witness stated in his examination-in-chief that the
appellant came to his shop with an eight-year-old girl sitting on his
motorcycle, purchased a bottle of beer, and even quarrelled as regards
the price. The relevant portion of this testimony would read as under:
"I work as a salesman at Salampura Wine Shop. This shop is
owned by Bansi Lal Mewada, resident of Sardargarh. On 17-1-2013,
at 6.30 p.m. in the evening, I was at the liquor shop. At that time,
the accused Manoj Pratap Singh, who is present in the court, came
on motorcycle. A girl of about eight years was sitting in front of his
motorcycle. The accused Manoj Pratap Singh came to the liquor shop
and he asked for a bottle of beer. I gave him a bottle of beer and
asked for eighty rupees. He was having shortage of twenty rupees.
He quarrelled and fought with me. Then he gave twenty rupees, took
the bottle of beer and went away on motorcycle. At that time the
child was sitting with him on the motorcycle. Next day I came to
know that accused Manoj Pratap Singh raped and killed the child."
13.10. In his cross-examination, this witness PW 12 Ranjeet Singh
stated as under:
"Police came to my shop on 18th and made enquiries. On the
same day, they took my statement. I work alone in the Salampura
Wine Shop. At first he did not give twenty rupees but thereafter he
gave it. The fact of giving twenty rupees has not been written in the
police statement. It was a sky-blue coloured Passion motorcycle. I
do not know the registration number of the motorcycle. I do not
remember the colour of the clothes that accused Manoj Pratap Singh,
who is present in the court, was wearing on that day. Accused Manoj
Pratap Singh, who is present in the court, went towards Housing
Board on his motorcycle. I did not see accused Manoj Pratap Singh
raping or killing the child. I heard about it on the next day."
13.11. PW 6 Khemchand, who is the brother of Dharam Das,
identified his signatures on panchayatnama (Ext. P-8), site plans (Exts.
P-3 and P-4), memo of seizure of clothes (Ext. P-9), and memo of
handing over the dead body to Dharam Das (Ext. P-10). PW 4 Narendra
Singh was also a witness to panchayatnama and he too identified his
signatures. PW 7 Kuldeep Singh and PW 8 Ajay Singh had been the
witnesses to various proceedings in the investigation including seizure
of the motorcycle (Ext. P-15), collection of blood samples from the
tank, pedal and cylinder of the motorcycle (Ext. P-16); recovery of the
frock of the deceased which was smeared with blood (Ext. P-17);
collection of soil sample carrying bloodstains (Ext. P-18); preparation of
site plan of the place of occurrence and memo of inspection (Ext. P-20
and Ext. P-21); and memos of further inspection of the motorcycle and
the place of occurrence (Ext. P-22 and Ext. P-23). They duly testified to
the proceedings conducted in their presence and to their signatures on
the relevant memos.
14. The medical, scientific and other cognate evidence in this matter
could be broadly divided into four parts : first being the post-mortem
report of the dead body of victim girl and depositions of the members
of Medical Board who carried out post-mortem; second being the
evidence concerning medical examination of the appellant-accused;
third being the evidence concerning age and disabilities of the victim
girl; and fourth being the report of the forensic science laboratory,
particularly on DNA matching.
14.1. In the post-mortem report (Ext. P-35), the nature and extent
of the injuries on the dead body of the victim came to be stated, inter
alia, in the following terms:
"II CRANIUM & SPINAL CORD
Note.- - The spinal canal need not be examined unless any
indication of disease or injury exists.

(12) Abrasions of 7 X 5 cm on lateral side of right knee joint.
(13) Multiple abrasions on and around left knee joint."
14.2. The members of Medical Board comprising of three medical
officers pointed out in the post-mortem report that all the injuries were
fresh and of the duration within 16-18 hours of examination. They
stated their remarks in the following terms:
"REMARKS BY MEDICAL OFFICER
In the opinion of Medical Board, cause of death is head injury.
Ante-mortem rape done."
14.3. PW 14 Dr Manju Purohit, who was working as Gynaecologist,
R.K. Hospital, Rajsamand at the relevant time and was a member of the
Medical Board, testified to the aforesaid post-mortem report and to the
steps taken by the Medical Board in collecting, sealing and delivering
various samples/swabs. This witness was not only cross-examined on
behalf of the appellant-accused, but was also posed questions by the
Court and was cross-examined yet further. The relevant part of her
testimony in cross-examinations and Court questioning could be
usefully extracted as under:
"Generally, after six hours of death, rigor mortis starts in a body
but it also depends upon the weather condition. It is wrong to say
that contraction was found in the body. All the external injuries
mentioned in Ext. P-35 post-mortem report cannot be sustained
together by falling from motorcycle. Injuries below neck, jaw and
vagina cannot be sustained after falling from a motorcycle. It is
wrong to say that the injuries could be sustained due to dupatta
stuck on the neck. It is correct that at the time of examination,
human semen was not found on her body. It is correct that human
semen was also not found on the outer surface of vagina. It is correct
that on Ext. P-36 the certificate and post-mortem report number is
blank.
Question by Court
Q. What is your expert medical opinion after conducting external
and internal examination of the injuries on the body and after
analysing the entire circumstances and condition of the body?
A. In my expert opinion, the eight-year-old innocent girl had been
brutally and inhumanly raped and on objecting, the person who
raped her behaved in an inhuman and cruel manner as a result of
which, she sustained different simple and grievous injuries due to
which she died. Laceration of the vagina of the deceased shows that
she was brutally raped in an inhuman manner.
Cross Examination : Advocate for the accused Shri B.K. Bairwa
The cause of death was injury caused on the head."
14.4. PW 15 Dr Kailash Chand as also PW 21 Dr Chetna Vaishnav
had been the other members of the Medical Board that carried out post-
mortem examination and they corroborated the testimony of PW 14 on
all the material particulars. PW 21 Dr Chetna Vaishnav, also stated in
her examination-in-chief that after examination, the Medical Board was
of the opinion that "the deceased was subjected to brutal rape and her
death was caused". This witness further testified to the physical
examination of the appellant-accused after his arrest, when she found
abrasions on his right knee and made such an entry on the application
of the investigating officer (Ext. P-41). The relevant parts of her
testimony in cross-examination would read as under:
"
It is wrong that the entire injury on the body of the deceased
can occur after falling from motorcycle. It is correct that traces of
sperm were not found on the body of the deceased but we took the
samples from vagina of the deceased for examination of this fact
It is wrong that all the injuries on the body of the deceased were self
-caused but some of the injuries on the body of the deceased may
be self-caused. It is correct that in Ext. P-35, from X to Y, it has not
been mentioned in the opinion regarding death that which of the
specific injury sustained on which part of the head resulted in death
but in the opinion of Medical Board, multiple injuries were found on
the head of the deceased which collectively resulted in death of the
deceased. The said injuries can be sustained by blunt weapon or by
ramming the head on stone. It is correct that in this context, there is
no opinion of the Medical Board available on Ext. P-35 post-mortem
report. Signature of PMO is from G to H on Ext. P-41 and, date is of
20-1-2013 and time is 11.40 a.m. It is wrong that Ext. P-41 Letter
was given on 20-1-2013. I had examined the accused on 19-1-2013
at 12.00 p.m. It seems that PMO has mistakenly mentioned the date
on Ext. P-41 from G to H. It is wrong that Ext. P-41 was given on
20th..
"
14.5. As regards the medical procedures conducted on the question
of sexual capability of the appellant and collection of his blood sample,
PW 22 Dr Satish Singhal, the Medical Officer, R.K. Hospital, Rajsamand
testified to his report (Ext. P-43) to the effect that there was nothing to
suggest that the appellant was not capable of doing sexual intercourse.
This witness also testified to the factum of collection of blood sample of
the appellant after his consent (Ext. P-44) and to the forwarding letter
for the Chief Chemical Examiner of the forensic science laboratory (Ext.
P-45). Nothing substantial is available in his cross-examination except
that the details of procedure carried out by him were not mentioned in
Ext. P-43.
14.6. As regards age of the deceased and her mental and physical
disabilities, the prosecution led documentary evidence in support, being
the Medical Board's certificate dated 4-3-2010 on permanent disability
(Ext. P-11), where it was noted that the deceased K suffered from
spastic palsy with 70% permanent disability; Progress report (Ext. P-
13) issued by Jagriti Vidyalaya, a special school for children with
mental disabilities, along with a certificate (Ext. P-12) issued by the
same school, which stated that the child had an IQ of 50%. Another
certificate from Government Primary School, Gadriyawas, Dhoinda (Ext.
P-14) was also produced. The said certificates (Exts. P-12 to P-14) gave
her date of birth as 9-7-2005. PW 18 Dr Narendra Paliwal proved the
said certificate Ext. P-11. The relevant part of his deposition in the
cross-examination would read as under:
"It is correct that in Ext. P-11 certificate, the age of K is not
mentioned and identification mark is also not mentioned
It
is
correct that in Ext. P-11, neither there is signature nor thumb
impression of K.... It is correct that in issuance of this certificate
there was no neurologist in the board. I had issued the said
certificate for physical disability and not for any neurological
examination. It is correct that the said certificate is related to
orthopaedics. It is wrong to say that the muscles could tear in this
disease."
14.7. It is also noticed that by way of a communication dated 22-1-
2013 (Ext. 52), the later investigating officer PW 25 Umesh Ojha
sought medical opinion/comments regarding the nature of disablement
of deceased K with reference to the said certificate dated 4-3-2010
(Ext. P-11) whereupon, the Medical Officer made his endorsement in
the following words:
"As per the certificate issued, her coordination movements of
limbs which are controlled by brain were disturbed and as such she
was physically and mentally challenged child."
14.8. We may also usefully extract the relevant parts of the report of
DNA examination carried out by the State Forensic Science Laboratory,
Rajasthan, Jaipur (that was drawn on 8-4-2013 and came to be marked
as Ext. P-51), which would read as under:
"DNA was extracted from all the samples except Ext. 7 (control
swab), 9 (blood smeared soil) and 10 (control soil). DNA profiles
were prepared by using microsatellite loci of AmpFISTR
Identifiler Plus. Data was
analysed by GeneMapper ID-X Software. Blood samples were
consumed during examination.
Result of examination
(1) Same female DNA profile was obtained from Ext. 1 (coat), 2
(pant), 3 (shirt), 5 (pajami), 6 (blood from motorcycle), 8 (frock),
12 (vaginal swab), 13 (vaginal smear) and Ext. 14 (blood sample of
K).
(2) Male DNA profile was obtained from Ext. 4 (underwear) which
is matching with the DNA profile of Ext. 11 (blood sample of Manoj
Pratap Singh).
Conclusion
The DNA test performed on the exhibits is sufficient to conclude
that the DNA profile obtained from Ext. 1 (coat), 2 (pant), 3 (shirt),
5 (pajami), 6 (blood from motorcycle), 8 (frock), 12 (vagina swab),
13 (vaginal smear) is matching with the DNA profile of Ext. 14
(blood sample of K)."
15. The evidence of a few official witnesses related with the process
of investigation may also be noticed in requisite details.
15.1. PW 19 Nand Lal was the second in command at Police Station,
Kankroli at the relevant time. This witness testified to the facts about
lodging of report and handing over investigation to PW 20 SHO upon
his arrival at the police station. He identified the signatures of PW 1
Kamla and PW 3 Madan Lal as also his own signature on the report, Ext.
P-1 and the FIR, Ext. P-2.
15.2. The testimony of PW 20 Ganesh Nath, SHO is pertinent since
the appellant was arrested by him; the first disclosure statement was
made by the appellant to him; and the initial processes related with
investigation were carried out by him. The relevant extracts of his
examination-in-chief, particularly those relating to the arrest and
medical examination of the appellant as also of discoveries on the
information of the appellant, would read as under:
"
I started the search proceedings along with grandfather and
father and brought Manoj Pratap Singh from Kankaroli Bus-stand to
the police station and after making necessary enquiry, arrested him
vide Ext. P-5 At the time when Manoj Pratap Singh was arrested,
he was wearing coat, jeans, shirt and underwear among which,
bloodstains were found on his coat, jeans and underwear, which
were seized vide memo, Ext. P-6. Then they were sealed and
stamped
In custody, accused Manoj Pratap Singh voluntarily disclosed on
18-1-2013 at 2.30 a.m. to me, the SHO, that he could get recovered
the dead body of the girl whom he abducted from R.K. Hospital,
Rajsamand, killed her and disposed her body at Kamal Talai. The
said information was written according to the statement of the
accused and the memo has been marked as Ext. P-40 on which
signature of accused Manoj Pratap Singh is from A to B who was read
over and explained the contents of memo marked as Ext. P-40 who
understood the contents and imposed his signature from A to B and
my signature is from C to D. After writing the said information, we
went to the place in government vehicle as disclosed by accused
Manoj Pratap
Singh along with witnesses Madan Lal and Dharam Raj who were
present there. He asked us to stop and get down from the vehicle at
the place where Kamal Talai Road meets at 50 ft road. He got down
from the vehicle and walking ahead, pointed towards dead body of a
girl on the railing of a bridge and said that this is the girl whom he had
abducted. Dharam Raj who was also accompanying saw the body and
exclaimed that she is her daughter K. Since it was dark, I inspected the
body in torchlight and found that the girl was dead. There was black-
coloured underwear on her body and rest of the body was completely
nude. Multiple abrasions were present on the body of the girl and there
was injury on her eye. Since it was night, I prepared memo of recovery
Ext. P-7 on which signature of accused Manoj Pratap Singh is from E to
F, signature of witness Dharam Raj is from A to B, signature of witness
Madan Lal is from C to D and my signature is from G to H Thereafter,
at dawn, panchayatnama of girl K was prepared after calling the
attesting witnesses wherein all the particulars and the injuries present
on the entire body were mentioned; the same were read over to
panchas who, after looking at all the circumstances, opined that the
death of the girl K was the result of injuries caused to her body. Memo
of Panchayatnama of the body is Ext. P-8.... Thereafter, the dead body
was seized and kept in the mortuary of R.K. Hospital, Rajsamand and
report was sent to the board for post-mortem. Post-mortem was
conducted by Medical Board and after post-mortem black-coloured
lower (pajami) which the girl was wearing at the time of incident and
on which bloodstains were found, was seized, kept in a bag, sealed,
stamped and marked as Ext. P-9
In custody, I got the injuries on the body of accused Manoj
Pratap Singh examined for which, I gave the requisition to the
medical officer of R.K. Hospital, Rajsamand, the copy of which is Ext.
P-41 on which, my signature is from A to B. Thereupon, the accused
was physically examined by Dr Chetna, who recorded the description
of injuries on Ext. P-41 which is C to D and signature of doctor is
from E to F. Thereafter, following the order of the higher officials, the
investigation was handed over to the circle officer Shri Umesh
Ojha "
15.3. The relevant portion of the cross-examination of PW 20 Ganesh
Nath could also be usefully reproduced as under:
"It is wrong that on the same day Kamla handed over a missing
report to Nand Lalji. It is correct that I was not present when Kamla
came to the police station. My staffs, Dharam Raj and Madan Lal
were accompanying me when search proceedings were conducted.
When I received the information at 8.20 p.m., I was with my staffs.
Thereafter, I came to the police station and went in search along
with Dharam Raj and Madan Lal. I came back to the police station
after 2-3 hours and went in search along with Dharam Raj and
Madan Lal. Accused Manoj Pratap Singh was arrested by me. I
caught accused Manoj Pratap Singh from old Bus-stand at Kankaroli,
took him to the police station and after making enquiries, I arrested
him. I prepared the arrest memo after arresting the
accused at the police station, therefore, in Ext. P-5 the place of arrest is
blank but at the top the place of arrest has been mentioned as
Kankaroli Police Station. It is correct that I seized the clothes of the
accused Manoj Pratap Singh and thereafter provided him other clothes
to wear. I cannot say as to whether at that time accused Manoj Pratap
Singh was under influence of any intoxicant but he has not consumed
liquor and he did not appear to be under influence of the same After
receiving information under Section 27, I went to the place of incident
where accused Manoj Pratap Singh got down from the vehicle and he
was walking in front of us. There was a house in front of the place
where dead body of K was found and remaining areas were plots and
agricultural lands. It is correct that the dead body was found at Kamal
Talai road where 50 ft road meets. It is correct that I did not enquire
the people of the said house or people near that house because further
investigation was done by Deputy Sir. Statement of accused Manoj
Pratap Singh under Section 27 was written word by word. It is correct
that accused Manoj Pratap Singh is educated. Accused has stated that
he is educated till Class 10. It is correct that it was dark when the body
of
K was recovered. It was 3.00 a.m It is correct that at the time
of
arrest, there was injury on the knee of accused Manoj Pratap Singh. It
is correct that there was no injury on the face and chest of accused
Manoj Pratap Singh
It is wrong that I have arrested any wrong
person or there was any pressure on me."
15.4. The disclosure statement made by the appellant to PW 20 SHO
on 18-1-2013 has been marked as Ext. P-40, and its contents would
read as under:
"I have murdered the girl whom I had kidnapped from R.K.
Hospital. Her dead body is lying towards Kamal Talai, which I can
get recovered."
15.5. The testimony of PW 25 Umesh Ojha, who was the Circle
Officer, Rajsamand and who carried out the later part of investigation in
this case is equally pertinent. The appellant allegedly disclosed the
place of incident, the location of motorcycle and the location of frock to
this witness, who carried out the necessary seizures and follow-up
proceedings. This investigating officer also collected other evidence
concerning the appellant, including his sexual capability test report and
his antecedents. The relevant extracts of his testimony would read as
under4:
On 19-1-2013 accused Manoj Pratap Singh present in court
today voluntarily informed me that he could show the place where
motorcycle which was used in the incident had been left, he can
accompany us to the place and the nearby places where he raped
the deceased and where
her blood soaked kurta had been left. The said information Ext. P-48
was recorded word by word as stated by the accused and thereafter
read over to him As per the information obtained, we went to the
place of incident for investigation and recovery along with the
summoned witnessed Kuldeep Singh and Ajay Singh and accused
Manoj Pratap Singh. As per the information of accused Manoj Pratap
Singh we reached near canal ahead of cremation ground on the way to
Dhoinda from 50 feet road where the accused Manoj Pratap Singh asked
us to stop; hence we stopped the vehicle and got down. Then accused
Manoj Pratap Singh pointed towards east and said that it was the place
where he raped the deceased and left the motorcycle.
250 m away
from where we got down, accused Manoj Pratap Singh
who was
walking in front of us, stopped and pointed towards the place where he
left the motorcycle. We saw the motorcycle lying near the bundle of
sticks. The side of the motorcycle where there is silencer was touching
the ground, headlight of motorcycle was towards wall of field,
motorcycle was blood smeared and its number was RJ 30 3M 5944.
Accused Manoj Pratap Singh stated that on this very motorcycle he
brought the girl here. The said motorcycle was used in the incident and
therefore, it was seized and memo prepared which is Ext. P-15
Motorcycle's right side back indicator was broken and hanging; and its
petrol tank, silencer, engine body, and rim of backside tyre were
smeared with blood. Since it was not possible to send the motorcycle to
FSL for examination of the bloodstains on it, specimen sample of blood
was taken on gauze of white cloth and control sample was also taken;
and they were placed in separate plastic containers and were sealed.
The sample was marked D and control was marked D 1 for which a
separate memo was prepared which is Ext. P-16
Thereafter accused Manoj Pratap Singh
walked approximately 3
m from where motorcycle was lying and indicated by his hand and
said that there is frock-type skirt, which the deceased girl was
wearing; on a close look, the skirt was of red colour with light yellow
dots; the skirt was torn and there was blood on its lower side
Thereafter
Manoj Pratap Singh
walked to another side of
way approximately 2.5 m, showed by hand, and said that at this
place I raped the deceased girl. That place was looking hard on
which scratch marks and bloodstains were there. In presence of
witnesses, blood sample and control sample were taken separately
for test by FSL
*
*
*
During investigation I wrote a letter to Medical Officer, R.K.
Hospital about DNA test and sexual capability test of accused Manoj
Pratap Singh which is Ext. P-42 on which G to H is my signature. On
this medical officer gave the sexual capability report Ext. P-43;
carbon copy of identity and consent form is Ext. P-44 and carbon
copy of forwarding the blood sample for DNA test is Ext. P-45
*
*
*
During investigation I had obtained the disability certification of K
by the Board of doctors, which is Ext. P-11 on which I to J is my
endorsement and K to L is my signature. I also obtained the mental
retardation certificate of deceased K from Shri Dwarkesh Aksham
Seva Sansthan which is Ext. P-12 on which C to D is my
endorsement, E to F is my signature and A to B signature of the
grandfather of the deceased Madan and G to H is signature of
Principal, Jagriti Special School, Kankroli. The progress report of
Jagriti Special School, Kakroli is Ext. P-13 on which C to D is my
endorsement and E to F is my signature. The certificate of date of
birth and school entrance form of Govt. Primary School, Gadriyawas
is Ext. P-14 on which C to D is my endorsement and E to F is my
signature, G to H is signature and seal of the Principal, Govt. Primary
School, Gadriyawas, Dohinda

*
*
The first information report registered at Police Station
Nathdwara regarding theft of the motorcycle number RJ 30 3M 5944,
used by the accused Manoj Pratap Singh in the present incident, is
Ext. P-46, carrying my endorsement at C to D and my signature at E
to F.
A written requisition sent to the SHO, PS Shambhupra, District
Chittorgarh for obtaining the previous conviction record of the
accused Manoj Pratap Singh and his report is Ext. P-47 on which G to
H is my endorsement and I to J is my signature. Along with this
letter, the SHO PS Shambhupra, District Chittorgarh had forwarded
the true copy of FIR No. 69/11 registered against accused Manoj
Pratap Singh with the charge-sheet, which was taken on the file.
Similarly, FIR No. 428/12 and charge-sheet therein against the
accused Manoj Pratap Singh at PS Rajnagar, District Rajsamand was
taken on record. The copies of FIR and charge-sheet in Cases Nos.
79/12 and 78/12 registered at PS Kankroli, District Rajsamand were
also taken on record
"
15.6. We may also usefully extract the relevant parts of the
statement made by this witness (PW 25) in cross-examination as
under:
"It is true that from where motorcycle was seized was an open
area. It is also true that from where deceased's frock was seized was
an open area. It is wrong that cremation ground was near the place
of incident but was far away from there. It is wrong that public
movement is there at the place of incident. 50 feet road is far away
from the place of incident. It is wrong that near canal public way is
situated rather, trails type way is available for movement towards
fields. It is true that information provided by the accused under
Section 27 which is Ext. P-48 was written by me. It is true that
accused Manoj Pratap is educated. The accused Manoj Pratap Singh
was only signed on Ext. P-48. It is wrong that houses are
constructed nearby the place of incident. Fields being situated near
the place of incident and nobody being there, the information about
fields was obtained from the area patvari and the owners were asked
about the incident but they did not have any information and
therefore their statement not recorded
It is true that there was
one house near the place where the victim's dead body was
lying, which was a little away. It is true that the person who was
residing in that house had no knowledge about the incident that took
place in the night and therefore, his statement was not recorded. It is
true that the bridge where the victim's dead body was found might be
of public movement, but as the incident happened during night
therefore, there would have been no public movement at that time
I
can't say that there had been rainfall at the time of incident. I can't say
that there had been rainfall on second day of incident
It is true that
information related to incident as given by the accused was recorded
word to word. It is wrong that at that time accused told that he is
innocent. It is wrong that seized article were safely not sent to the FSL
for test. It is true that no criminal case was lodged against the accused
at Police Station Gugali, District Maharajganj, (Uttar Pradesh) which is
endorsed on the back of memo Ext. P-31. It is wrong that I was under
pressure and carried out wrong investigation. It is wrong that there had
been demonstrations in the city when the accused was not found;
rather, after his arrest there had been demonstrations against him. It is
wrong that I investigated the case only on the basis of circumstantial
evidence, rather investigated with recording of the statements of
independent witnesses present at the time of kidnapping. It is true that
no one had seen the accused raping and killing the deceased."
15.7. The disclosure statement made by the appellant-accused to
PW 25 on 19-1-2013 has been marked as Ext. P-48 and its contents
would read as under:
"I can show the place where the motorcycle used by me at the
time of incident is lying and the nearby place where blood smeared
kurta of the deceased is lying and the place where I committed rape
on her, which is also nearby."
15.8. PW 23 Ramdev Regar, Sub-Inspector of Police, deposed
regarding the fact that a report about theft of motorcycle bearing
Registration No. RJ30 3M 5944 was lodged at Police Station Nathdwara
on 14-1-2013. This witness stated as under:
"On 14-1-2013, I was posted as Sub-Inspector at Nathdwara
Police Station. On that day complainant Ramesh Chand, son of
Purushottam, resident of Sundercha presented a written report that
Hero Honda Passion Plus motorcycle of his master Girishji Garg,
bearing Registration No. RJ 30 3AM 5994 was parked near Naniji ka
Bag, Nathdwara, which had been stolen by an unknown person. On
the basis of the said report, Case No. 39/13 under Section 379 IPC
was registered and investigation was handed over to ASI Peshawar
Khan. On the basis of the said report, I registered the FIR, the
certified photocopy whereof is 46 and my signature is from A to B."
15.9. This witness PW 23 deposed in his cross-examination as
under:
"In this matter, I have not seized the said motorcycle. It is correct
that in the instant matter, I have not obtained the RC or other
documents of the motorcycle."
15.10. There had been other official witnesses who carried out
different tasks in the aid of investigation, like PW 10, PW 11, PW 13,
PW 16; and another official witness PW 24, who filed the charge-sheet.
Their evidence, essentially of formal nature, need not be dilated upon.
16. The appellant in his statement under Section 313 CrPC stated
that he had been falsely implicated in the case. The appellant, however,
did not lead any evidence in his defence.
D. The trial court found the appellant guilty and awarded death
sentence
17. The trial court, in its judgment of conviction dated 28-9-2013,
accepted the prosecution case and, while rejecting the contentions
urged in defence, held that the chain of circumstances was duly
established by the prosecution, bringing home the guilt of the appellant
-accused.
D.1. Deceased aged 7 1/2 years, mentally and physically
challenged
18. The trial court, in the first place, took up for consideration the
questions relating to the age and alleged disablement of the deceased.
The trial court held, with reference to the Medical Board's certificate on
permanent disability dated 4-3-2010 (Ext. P-11) and the statement of
PW 18 Dr Narendra Paliwal, that the deceased was suffering from
spastic palsy because of which, the aggregate percentage of her
permanent disability was 70%. The doctor also specified that the
medical condition of the deceased girl was due to imbalance between
the movements of limbs and brain. The court also referred to the
statements of PW 1 Kamla, PW 2 Dharam Das, PW 3 Madan Lal, PW 17
Dinesh Bhatia and PW 5 Maniraj Singh, who testified to the fact that
the deceased was a mentally and physically challenged child. In fact, in
the certificate dated 20-1-2013 issued by Jagriti Vidyalaya, a special
school for children with disabilities (Ext. P-12), it was also stated that
the deceased was a mentally retarded child with 50% IQ.
19. As regards the age, with reference to the aforesaid certificate
(Ext. P-12) as also the progress report of the same school for the
session 2009-2010 (Ext. P-13) and the certificate from Government
Primary School, Gardiyawas, Dohinda (Ext. P-14), the trial court found
that the date of birth of the deceased K was 9-7-2005 and hence, she
was about 7 1/2 years of age on the date of incident i.e. 17-1-2013. The
trial court also observed that the witnesses stated her age at 8 years
only in their approximation.
20. Thus, the trial court concluded that the deceased was 7 1/2 years
of age at the time of incident and she was suffering from 70% physical
disablement and was also mentally retarded.
D.2. Deceased last seen with the appellant
21. The trial court, thereafter, took up for consideration the question
of kidnapping of the deceased girl and referred to the testimony of PW
1 Kamla, PW 2 Dharam Das, PW 3 Madan Lal, PW 17 Dinesh Bhatia as
also that of PW 12 Ranjeet Singh and PW 5 Maniraj and held proved the
facts that the
appellant kidnapped the deceased from the lawful guardianship of her
parents with intent to secretly and wrongly confine her; and that the
deceased was last seen with the appellant.
D.3. Discoveries on the information of the appellant
22. Moving on with the chain of circumstances, the trial court
referred to the facts emanating from the statements of PW 2 Dharam
Das and PW 3 Madan Lal that:
(a) the appellant was found at about 2.00 a.m. at the bus-stand
with bloodstained clothes;
(b) the appellant disclosed that the dead body of the victim was
lying at Kamal Talai; and
(c) the appellant got recovered the dead body at Kamal Talai.
The trial court also referred to the testimony of PW 20 Ganesh Nath as
regards arrest of the appellant and the disclosure statement made by
him (Ext. P-40) whereupon the dead body was recovered at Kamal
Talai. Thus, the trial court held proved the basic facts that the appellant
was arrested after about 7 1/2 hours of his kidnapping the victim girl; the
clothes worn by him were bloodstained, which were seized and sealed;
and after about 1 1/2 hours of his arrest, the dead body of the victim girl
was recovered at the disclosure and information of the appellant.
23. The trial court also found proved the factum of other recoveries
at the instance of the appellant like that of motorcycle used by him and
the frock worn by the deceased, as duly established by the oral and
documentary evidence adduced by the prosecution. It was also
observed by the trial court that the place of recoveries was such that it
was only within the knowledge of the appellant.
D.4. Medical evidence
24. As regards the questions of rape and murder of the victim girl,
the trial court made an elaborate reference to the post-mortem report
(Ext. P-35) and the depositions of PW 14 Dr Manju Purohit and PW 21
Dr Chetna Vaishnav, particularly concerning the nature of injuries and
the expert opinion on the manner of causing them and, inter alia, found
as under:
"
as per her expert opinion, forcible rape has been committed on
an 8-year-old innocent girl in extremely cruel and heinous manner
and on resisting the rape, she was treated with extreme cruelty and
mercilessly due to which, several simple and grave injuries were
caused on the person of deceased and she died due to such injuries.
The witness has also expressed that vagina of the deceased was
ruptured leading to the conclusion that rape was committed on her
in a beastly and merciless manner. The said statements of witnesses
were confirmed by post-mortem report (Ext. P-35) prepared by the
Medical Board."
D.5. Report of FSL
25. The trial court also referred to the other evidence on record
establishing the collection of samples and proper forwarding of the
same to the FSL. The trial court further referred to the linking evidence,
including the additional statement of PW 1 Kamla, as regards the
clothing of her deceased daughter. Thereafter, the trial court referred to
the FSL report (Ext. P-51) wherein it was found that the DNA profile of
blood collected from the person and clothing of the deceased matched
with the DNA profile of blood found on the coat, pants and shirt of the
appellant as also that found on the motorcycle. The facts established by
this substantial piece of evidence and the conclusions deducible
therefrom were found by the trial court as follows:
"Thus from the said DNA test, the DNA profile obtained from the
coat (Ext. 1), pants (Ext. 2) and shirt (Ext. 3) and from the pajami
of the prosecutrix (Ext. 5), blood sample taken from the motorcycle
of the accused (Ext. 6), frock of the prosecutrix (Ext. 8), vaginal
swab of the prosecutrix (Ext. 12) and vaginal smear (Ext. 13) are
matching with DNA profile of blood sample obtained from the
prosecutrix (Ext. 14). Meaning thereby, blood found on coat, pants
and shirt worn by the accused at the time of incident, which were
seized at the time of arrest and that found on the motorcycle used
by the accused at the time of incident, is matching with DNA profile
of blood sample of the prosecutrix. From this cogent circumstantial
evidence, the only conclusion is that with intention to secretly and
wrongfully confine the prosecutrix, only the accused kidnapped her
and took her to a secluded place and committed rape on her and
murdered her by causing injuries."
D.6. Defence contentions rejected
26. The assertion of the appellant that he was falsely implicated in
the matter was not accepted by the trial court, since he did neither
provide any reason for his false implication nor made any such
suggestion to the prosecution witnesses. The trial court also dealt with
every submission made on behalf of the appellant by the defence
counsel and rejected the same, as noticed infra.
26.1. It was contended that as per PW 1 Kamla, she had not stated
the name of the appellant at the time of giving the initial report. With
reference to the timing of report as also the statement of PW 3 Madan
Lal, the trial court found that such a contention was totally baseless and
a particular line in the statement of PW 1 Kamla occurred only because
of her ignorance about the meaning of words. It was also found that in
the report (Ext. P-1), the particulars were clearly stated that the
appellant was previously known to them. Another contention that the
parents and other relatives of the deceased did not raise alarm at the
time of kidnapping of the girl was also found baseless with reference to
the facts of the case and the statement of PW 1 Kamla. Even this was
argued that the FIR was lodged after some delay but the Court found,
with reference to the time of kidnapping and the distance of police
station, that there was no such delay in lodging the FIR.
26.2. It was further argued that there was discrepancy in the colour
of motorcycle as stated by PW 1 Kamla (sky-blue colour) and as stated
by PW 17 Dinesh Bhatia (green colour). The Court found that the
recovered motorcycle was green in colour and bloodstains of the
deceased were found on the same. Thus, such discrepancy of colour
was of no effect. Another contention was that the place of arrest was
not stated in Ext. P-5. The trial court found that the place of arrest was
mentioned as Police Station Kankroli and it was not of any effect on the
substance of the prosecution case. Similarly, the attempts on the part
of the defence to suggest some minor contradictions, about how many
persons were available at the time of kidnapping of the child or whether
she was wearing slippers or not and the contention that the main
witnesses were all interested persons, were rejected by the trial court,
being of no substance. Further, the questions sought to be raised about
the presence of witnesses of seizure and recovery, etc. were also found
baseless and were rejected.
26.3. An argument was also raised that the place of recovery of the
dead body i.e. Kamal Talai, was on the public way where anybody could
leave the dead body. The trial court rejected this contention too, with
reference to the fact that immediately after the incident, the dead body
was recovered at the instance of the appellant and he had failed to
show any other reason of his knowledge about the location of dead
body.
26.4. It was also argued that the house of one Manoj was shown
near the place of incident but he was not examined and that the
registration certificate of the motorcycle was also not produced. The
trial court found that Manoj was not even remotely related with the
matter nor was the owner of the motorcycle. It was also observed that,
in any case, such minor shortcomings in the investigation were of no
assistance to the accused. It was further argued on behalf of the
appellant that PW 12 Ranjeet Singh had not stated the registration
number of the motorcycle; that according to PW 1 Kamla, she came to
know at about 12.30 in the night that the appellant was found but the
time of arrest was shown at 2.00 a.m.; that no other injury except one
on knee was found on the body of the appellant; that the blood group
was not established; and that PW 25 Umesh Ojha stated the colour of
the skirt of the deceased as red with yellow dots but PW 1 Kamla stated
that the dots were of white colour.
26.5. All these hair-splitting arguments were noticed and rejected
by the trial court for being of no substance and having no material
bearing on the cogent and convincing evidence led by the prosecution.
Even the admissibility of FSL report was also questioned but this
contention was rejected by the trial court with reference to Section 293
CrPC.
26.6. The aforementioned consideration of the contentions urged on
behalf of the appellant by the trial court is to indicate the nature of
extensive arguments advanced on behalf of the appellant-accused in
the trial court. As shall be noticed hereafter later, this feature coupled
with in-depth cross-examination of each and every prosecution witness,
is of material bearing on one of the contentions urged before us about
want of proper legal assistance to the appellant in the trial court.
D.7. Chain of circumstances complete
27. Since there were no witnesses to the crime of rape and murder
and it had been a case of circumstantial evidence, after the abovenoted
discussion, the trial court held that the prosecution had been successful
in establishing the chain of circumstances linking the appellant with the
crime in such a manner that no other conclusion except that of his guilt
was possible. The Court held, inter alia, as under:
"On the basis of aforesaid discussion and analysis, the prosecution
has been fully successful in proving beyond doubt that near about
6.30 p.m. on 17-1-2013, the accused with premeditated criminal
mentality kidnapped, with intention to secretly and wrongfully
confine the 71/2-year-old 70% mentally disabled, innocent, helpless,
meek handicapped daughter of complainant Kamla, by making her to
sit on motorcycle in broad daylight in presence of her parents,
grandfather and uncle, taking unfair advantage of her natural
abnormality, physical and mental disability and by tempting her with
food stuff, from Housing Board within jurisdiction of Police Station
Kankroli, District Rajsamand; and took her to a lonely place near
crematorium on 50 ft road towards Dhoinda, in Kankroli with
premeditated intention of committing rape on her, kidnapped her;
and thereafter, in order to enhance his beastliness and inhumanity,
he consumed beer and then in a brutal manner, while scratching the
body of an innocent girl child, crossed the height of ignobility by
committing rape on her in extremely heinous manner; and murdered
her by causing multiple simple and grave injuries on her body in
extremely barbaric manner. Moreover, it is also proved that the
accused committed the offence of aggravated penetrative sexual
assault by causing grievous hurt and bodily harm to the deceased
while committing penetrative sexual assault.
Therefore, after aforesaid entire discussion, the prosecution has
been found successful in proving the offence charged against
accused Manoj Pratap Singh under Sections 363, 365, 376(2)(f), 302
IPC and under Section 6 of the Protection of Children from Sexual
Offences Act, 2012, beyond reasonable doubt. Hence, accused Manoj
Pratap Singh is liable to be convicted for the offence punishable
under Sections 363, 365, 376(2)(f), 302 IPC and under Section 6 of
the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012."
(emphasis supplied)
28. Thus, in the overall appreciation of the evidence on record and
the surrounding factors, the trial court was satisfied that the
prosecution had successfully substantiated its case beyond reasonable
doubt and accordingly, convicted the appellant of the offences under
Sections 363, 365, 376(2)(f), 302 IPC and Section 6 Pocso by its
judgment dated 28-9-2013.
D.8. Death sentence by the trial court
29. After having recorded the conviction as aforesaid, the trial court
took up the matter three clear days later i.e. on 1-10-2013 and heard
the arguments on the question of sentencing. The burning question
before the trial court was
about the punishment to be awarded for the major offences of rape and
murder of a seven-and-a-half-year-old girl child.
30. Having heard the learned Public Prosecutor for the State as also
the learned Amicus Curiae for the appellant-accused, the trial court
took note of the principles enunciated in various decisions of this Court;
and examined the aggravating factors on record, particularly those
relating to the gruesome nature of the crime as also the mitigating
factors projected on behalf of the appellant-accused that it was his first
offence; that he was 28 years of age; that he was a married person
with an 8-year-old daughter; and that his family including old parents
was dependent on him. Having examined all the relevant facts and
factors, the trial court formed the opinion that a lenient view could not
be taken looking to the nature of the crime; and, taking the case in
"the rarest of rare" category, found it just and appropriate to award
death sentence for the offence under Section 302 IPC. The trial court
also awarded other punishments, as noticed hereinbefore.
31. A few of the relevant observations of the trial court with
reference to the decisions of this Court and in its appreciation of
aggravating and mitigating circumstances before forming the opinion in
favour of awarding death sentence could be usefully extracted as
under:
"It is true that in homicidal offence, life sentence is a rule and
death sentence is an exception. Death sentence must be imposed
only when life imprisonment appears to be an altogether inadequate
punishment having regard to the relevant circumstances of the
crime. This point should also be considered whether there is
anything abnormal to award death sentence in the offence for which
life sentence could be awarded? Even after considering all the
important circumstances favouring an accused, the circumstances of
the offence should be such that there be no option but to award
death sentence. Death sentence should not be awarded except in the
most serious criminal cases. Before choosing the substitute of death
sentence, the circumstances of offence and accused should be taken
into consideration. When any helpless, innocent girl is murdered and
the accused is in a position to dominate her, then it will be proper to
award him death sentence. A Judge should prudently and carefully
determine the proportional and justified punishment for the
accomplishment of the objectives as per the sentencing provided by
law for serious offences. If, without any provocation and with cool
mind, a girl is kidnapped, raped and brutally murdered and the
murder is so heinous which not only hurts judicial sensitivity but also
shocks the pure conscience of society, death sentence will be the
only justice in such a case.

*
As it has been mentioned earlier that prosecution has clearly
proved against the accused with direct and circumstantial, cogent,
conclusive, incontrovertible evidence that on 17-1-2013 at about
6.30 p.m., accused Manoj Pratap Singh, son of Surendra Pratap
Singh, caste Rajput, aged 28 years, resident of Basantpur, Police
Station Gugli, District Maharajganj
(Uttar Pradesh) kidnapped a 71/2-year-old 70% physically disabled,
retarded, helpless, weak girl from the custody of her parents without
their permission in broad daylight and committed rape on her in a
brutal manner after taking her to a lonely place. During commission of
rape, the accused caused multiple simple & grave injuries on the body
of that helpless innocent girl in a cruel manner. The injuries mentioned
in the oral evidence of Medical Jurist and in post-mortem report (Ext. P-
35) were found on the body of the deceased. Multiple abrasions,
contusions and wounds were found on the head, ears, jaw, cheeks,
around neck, both the shoulders, chest, back, around frontal part below
umbilicus, thighs & knees of the deceased. Hymen of vagina of the
deceased was found to be having recent signs of ruptures; 2/3rd lower
part of vagina of the deceased and posterior and lateral side were found
completely torn; the outer skin in between vagina and anus of the
deceased was completely torn; and blood clots were found all around
the vagina. On internal examination of the deceased, multiple fractures
were found on her frontal occipital and temporoparietal regions due to
the injuries inflicted on head. In reply to the questions asked by the
Court, the Medical Jurist Dr Manju Purohit (PW 14) has expressed her
expert opinion as under:
"As per my expert opinion, forcible, brutal and heinous rape was
committed with an 8-year-old innocent girl and the deceased
resisted the rape and whosoever committed rape on her, had
behaved in extremely brutal and heinous manner because of which
various simple and serious injuries were inflicted on the body of the
deceased and she succumbed to the injuries found on her body. The
vagina of the deceased having been found in torn condition, the only
inference is rape had been committed on her in heinous and brutal
manner".
No evidence is available on record in support of the arguments
advanced on behalf of the accused. Even if these statements of the
accused are taken to be true for the sake of arguments that he is
married and father of 8-year-old daughter and he is the only son of
his old parents, then too, on the basis of such circumstances he does
not deserve lenient view or sympathy. Rather in the case in hand, no
such circumstances are present in favour of the accused on the basis
of which it would be justified to have sympathy or leniency for him
while passing order of sentence for the commission of the charged
offence.
In the aforesaid facts and circumstances, in my humble opinion,
the accused committed rape on the deceased heinously and brutally
at a lonely place after kidnapping her intentionally with cool mind
without any provocation. Thereafter, in the same sequence, the
deceased has been brutally murdered by causing injuries on her
body in a very inhumane, merciless and heinous manner. The act of
the accused against humanity falls within the purview of the rarest
of the rare case for being lowest, extreme, most brutal, merciless
and heinous murder case for which, it is obligatory to punish the
accused with death sentence for securing justice."
E. High Court confirmed the death sentence awarded to the
appellant
32. As noticed, this case came up before the High Court on two
counts viz. the death sentence submitted for confirmation and the
appeal against conviction and sentence preferred by the appellant. The
High Court reappreciated the material placed on record and, in its
common judgment and order dated 29-5-20151, upheld the decision of
the trial court in convicting the appellant of the aforementioned
offences and sentencing him to death for the offence under Section 302
IPC.
33. The High Court examined the statement of PW 1 Kamla, which
had been corroborated by PW 2 Dharam Das, PW 3 Madan Lal and PW 5
Maniraj Singh, to note that the appellant came to the fruit and
vegetable stand and took the deceased on his motorcycle towards
Somnath Chauraha; and that despite people in the locality chasing the
motorcycle, the appellant could not be located.
34. The High Court found that PW 6 Khem Chand had duly proved
Ext. P-3 (memo of inspection of place of incident and site map) and
Ext. P-8 (panchayatnama of the dead body of the deceased); and that
he had accompanied PW 2 and PW 3 when body of the deceased was
recovered pursuant to the disclosure statement of the appellant, who
led them to the location of the body. The factum of recovery of the
motorcycle used by the appellant and other articles was also found
proved by the statements of PW 7 Kuldeep Singh and PW 8 Ajay Singh.
35. The High Court laid emphasis on the statements of PW 14 Dr
The surest way legal research!
Manju Purohit, PW 15 Dr Kailash Chand and PW 21 Dr Chetna Vaishnav
as also on the post-mortem report (Ext. P-35) to find that the deceased
had been subjected to great cruelty at the time of commission of the
crimes of rape and murder. The High Court, thereafter, examined the
FSL's report on DNA examination (Ext. P-51) to find that the samples of
blood on the articles recovered from the appellant matched the samples
of the blood taken from the deceased. The findings of the High Court in
this regard could be reproduced as under : (Manoj Pratap Singh case1,
"18. The DNA Report which is Ext. P-51 on the record, shows that
the same DNA of female profile, namely, of the deceased was
obtained from Ext. 1 coat, Ext. 2 pants, Ext. 3 shirt, Ext. 4
underwear. Also to be noted is the statement of the investigating
officer that when the accused was apprehended he had bloodstains
on his clothing and the same were sent for DNA examination. The
matching of the blood group gains signification in such a
circumstance. The incriminating articles, namely, the clothes and the
blood group matching is an important circumstance showing
complicity of the appellant in the crime in question."
(emphasis supplied)
36. Having thus examined and analysed the evidence on record, the
High Court found that the prosecution had been successful in
establishing the chain of circumstances conclusively linking the
appellant with the crime, while ruling out any other hypothesis. The
High Court summed up its findings
paras 21-22)
"21. Taking all the evidence into account, we are of the opinion
that the circumstances which have been clearly established are :
that the appellant was seen taking the deceased on his motorcycle;
that the appellant had led to discovery of the dead body of the
deceased, the place where he kept his motorcycle which had
bloodstains of the deceased on it; at his instance the stone smeared
with blood was recovered5; that the medical report clearly indicates
about the injuries sustained by the deceased on her body; that the
injuries sustained on the private parts have been stated by the
doctor to have been caused by forcible sexual intercourse; that the
chemical analysis report links the accused with the crime; that the
appellant has not offered any explanation with regard to the recovery
made at his instance; other than a bald statement that he was not
guilty, the accused has not any evidence either to discredit the
prosecution witness or to establish his innocence : and that nothing
has been stated in his examination under Section 313 CrPC that
there was any justifiable reason to implicate him in the crime in
question. Thus, we find that each of the incriminating circumstances
has been clearly established and the chain of events are conclusive
in nature to exclude any other kind of hypothesis, but the one
proposed to be proved, and lead to a definite conclusion that the
crime was committed by the accused.
22. Therefore, finding no infirmity in the judgment under
challenge, we affirm the judgment given by the learned trial Judge
and dismiss the appeal filed by the accused Manoj Pratap Singh.
(emphasis supplied)
37. Having affirmed the conviction of the appellant, the High Court
proceeded to consider the question as to whether the death sentence
awarded to the appellant required any interference.
37.1. It was sought to be argued on behalf of the appellant before
the High Court that the case did not fall under the rarest of rare
category; that the mitigating circumstances operating in favour of the
appellant should be considered; and that a lenient view ought to be
taken with regard to sentencing, since he was 28 years of age at the
time of commission of the crime and had a family comprising of a minor
daughter, his wife and his father dependent on him.
37.2. The High Court took note of various leading decisions wherein
this Court has enunciated the principles to be applied in the matters of
sentencing, particularly relating to the offences where death sentence
could also be awarded. The High Court took note of the facts of the
present case involving the heinous crime of brutal rape and murder of a
young girl, who was below 8 years of age and was suffering from
physical and mental disabilities. The High Court also observed that
there was no element of compassion on the part of the appellant, who
brutally raped the child and smashed her head; and that the conduct of
the appellant with brutal nature of the offence did not call for any
leniency. The High Court further took note of the submissions made on
behalf of the appellant-accused about his being a young person and
having a family to support but observed that these were not the
mitigating circumstances in this case which gives repulsions to the
conscience of the Court and the community.
38. Hence, the High Court found that the present case was falling in
the category of the rarest of the rare and proceeded to confirm the
death sentence awarded to the appellant while observing as under :
"32. In the case in hand, there are no aggravating circumstances
(sic) or mitigating circumstances put forth to award a lesser
punishment than what has been awarded by the Sessions Court. The
accused after giving a chocolate to a young girl aged 8 years, who
not only was having permanent disability of 70% but also having IQ
of 50%, abducted her and took her away on a motorcycle.
Thereafter, he committed a heinous crime of not only brutally raping
her, but also hit her head against the silencer of the motorcycle as
well as with her stone causing her death. It is evident from the
statement made by the doctor who had conducted the post-mortem
that the young deceased tried to resist the rape but there was no
compassion shown at all. The plea raised by the learned counsel
appearing for the accused that leniency should be shown since the
accused was a young man with a family, cannot be said to be a
mitigating circumstance at all. The accused after brutally raping her,
hit her head against the motorcycle and then used a stone to smash
her head and tried to flee that very night itself. The heinous offence
of brutal rape on a helpless young girl followed by a cold-blooded
murder and calculated attempt to cover-up the said incident shocks
and repulses the conscience of this Court and the community.
Placing reliance upon the settled principles as enumerated by the
Supreme Court in several judgments, this Court has no hesitation in
holding that this case falls within the category of the rarest of the
rare cases and upholds the judgment passed by the Sessions Court.
In our opinion, the judgment passed by the Sessions Court suffers
from no error.
33. Therefore, DB Criminal Murder Reference No. 3 of 2013
preferred by the State of Rajasthan is allowed affirming the
judgment and order passed by the learned Sessions Judge dated 28-
9-2013. The death sentence awarded is confirmed. DB Criminal Jail
Appeal No. 854
of 2013 filed by the appellant-accused Manoj Pratap Singh is hereby
dismissed."
(emphasis supplied)
F. Rival submissions
39. Assailing the judgment and order aforesaid, Mr A. Sirajudeen,
learned Senior Counsel for the appellant has put forward a variety of
submissions while questioning the process of investigation as also the
manner of conducting the trial; and has asserted that the appellant was
denied a proper and adequate opportunity to defend himself. The
learned counsel has also endeavoured to find faults or shortcomings in
the evidence adduced by the prosecution; the main plank of
submissions had been that the prosecution case is based on a weak
chain of circumstantial evidence and the appellant is entitled to the
benefit of "residual doubt". The learned counsel has also questioned the
sentence awarded to the appellant with the submissions that in view of
several mitigating factors, it would not be justified to punish him with
death.
39.1. The learned Senior Counsel for the appellant has strenuously
argued that the investigation in this case had not been impartial and
has raised questions over investigation with the submissions that after
finding the appellant at the bus-stand, the police along with the father
of the deceased (PW 2), took him directly to the police station, recorded
his confession and thereafter took him to the spot where the body of
the deceased was found, instead of enquiring from him the
whereabouts of the deceased. Further, the unusual collecting of
evidence against the appellant in relation to other cases and overt
reliance on personal opinion of doctors about the manner of commission
of offence, establishes that the investigation was not impartial, where
final report was submitted within 12 days of the appellant's arrest,
even before receiving the DNA report.
39.2. The learned Senior Counsel has further contended that the
trial was conducted in a hurried manner, where reasonable time to
prepare for facing charges was not afforded to the appellant and at
least two months' time should have been given for the purpose of
perusal of final report. It has also been contended that the appellant
was not given the opportunity to meet his family members after arrest
nor was he given proper opportunity to engage a counsel of his choice,
thereby depriving him of his constitutional right guaranteed under
Article 22(1) of the Constitution of India. According to the learned
counsel, an inexperienced counsel was appointed in legal aid, who
failed to have any meeting or discussion with the appellant in prison in
order to formulate a better version of his defence in trial; and the
manner of cross-examination of the prosecution witnesses shows the
absence of preparation of the counsel and his inexperience in
conducting the defence.
39.3. While assailing the findings against the appellant on the basis
of the chain of circumstances, the learned Senior Counsel has referred
to certain aspects, which according to him, show the shortcomings and
lacunae in the prosecution case. In this regard, the learned counsel has
submitted that the name of the appellant was not mentioned in the
missing person report initially filed in this matter, as admitted by PW 1
and PW 3, though the appellant was
known to the family of the victim; and the said initial missing person
report is not on record. These factors, according to the learned counsel,
give rise to the possibility of the appellant being not the culprit. The
learned counsel has further submitted that the doctors PW 14, PW 15
and PW 21 unjustifiably used the expressions "brutal" and "inhuman" in
their statements though they were only expected to depose about the
nature of injuries found on the body and the weapon/object likely to
have caused the said injuries. According to the learned counsel,
absence of semen on the body of the victim as also in the vaginal swab
operate against the theory of rape in this case. Yet further, the learned
counsel has submitted that as per the account given by a number of
witnesses including eyewitnesses, there was rain, drizzling and storm
at the time of occurrence and the motorcycle used for kidnapping was
kept in open space. In such a situation, even the possibility of
bloodstains remaining on the metal surface of motorcycle is rare. The
learned counsel for the appellant has further argued that there is
nothing on record to show that the girl was mentally retarded; that the
witnesses have only deposed that she was feeble minded and even the
certificate issued from school to prove her mental calibre cannot be
relied upon because the person who issued such certificate was never
examined.
39.4. According to the learned Senior Counsel for the appellant, the
aforesaid factors individually and cumulatively lead to the position that
the present one is a case of weak chain of circumstances and conviction
of the appellant remains unsustainable.
39.5. Again, with reference to the nature of evidence adduced in this
matter and asserting it to be a case of weak chain of circumstances, the
learned Senior Counsel has strenuously argued that in any case and at
any rate, residual doubt remains about involvement of the appellant in
commission of the crime and he is entitled to the benefit thereof.
39.6. In this line of submissions, the learned Senior Counsel for the
appellant has also endeavoured to argue that the injuries found on the
body of the deceased were only bruises and abrasions, apart from the
injury on the head; and in the context of the deposition of PW 21 that
the death might have been caused as a result of rape, it could be
deduced that causing of death was not the intention of the appellant.
According to the learned counsel, only the knowledge of consequence of
act may be attributed but residual doubt does exist about absolute
certainty of the intention to commit the offence in a brutal manner.
39.7. The learned counsel has also submitted that the accused of an
offence of rape cannot be convicted under both POCSO and IPC as per
Section 42 Pocso. It can only be under any one of the enactments that
the Court could impose maximum punishment provided therein and
hence, life sentence awarded by the trial court for the offence under
Section 376 IPC as also under Section 6 Pocso is unsustainable in law.
40. As regards the question of sentence, the learned Senior Counsel
for the appellant has contended that even when the charge is proved
beyond reasonable doubt but is based on certain circumstances rather
than absolute proof, the
benefit of residual doubt ought to be given to the accused and capital
sentence should not be awarded. According to the learned counsel,
even if this case at all warrants conviction, it does not warrant the
punishment of death because it may be a rare case but, is not the
rarest of the rare.
40.1. The learned Senior Counsel for the appellant, while adverting
to the mitigating factors, has submitted that there is nothing on record
to show that the appellant has become a menace to the society or
cannot be reformed. It has also been highlighted that the appellant was
only about 28 years of age when the FIR was registered against him;
that he comes from a poor economic background; and that he has a
family with wife, 8-year-old daughter and 70-year-old father to look
after. With reference to these factors and the overall circumstances, the
learned counsel would argue that the appellant does not deserve death
and the sentence as awarded in this matter deserves to be commuted
to that of imprisonment for life.
40.2. The learned Senior Counsel for the appellant, in support of his
plea against the death sentence, has referred to several decisions of
this Court wherein death sentence was altered/commuted to other
sentence, including those in Viran Gyanlal Rajput V. State of
Maharashtra6 Babasaheb Maruti Kamble V. State of Maharashtra ²;
Nand Kishore V. State of M.P. 8 and CBI V. Sakru Mahagu Binjewar
41. Per contra, Dr Manish Singhvi, learned Senior Counsel appearing
for the respondent State has duly opposed the submissions made on
behalf of the appellant with reference to the evidence on record and the
findings recorded by the trial court and the High Court.
41.1. The learned Senior Counsel for the respondent State has
contended that the investigation has been carried out in the present
matter with due attention to necessary details; and there had not been
any shortcoming affecting the substance of the case. In relation to the
questions of procedural safeguards in the trial and opportunity to the
appellant-accused to defend himself, the learned counsel for the
respondent has submitted that the appellant never asked for a counsel
of his choice and it was through legal aid that a defence counsel was
appointed, who possessed sufficient experience of about 9 years.
Moreover, the counsel so appointed made qualitative efforts to conduct
the trial and examination of witnesses with best of his ability, who
rather deserves admiration for the efforts made by him. Hence, it
cannot be said that the appellant-accused was deprived of proper legal
assistance and proper opportunity to defend himself.
41.2. The learned Senior Counsel for the respondent would submit
that the evidence adduced by mother, father and maternal grandfather
of the deceased (PW 1, PW 2 and PW 3 respectively), is creditworthy
and unimpeachable; and the same is duly corroborated by PW 5 Maniraj
Singh, PW 12 Ranjeet Singh
and PW 17 Dinesh Bhatia, who were independent witnesses of the
relevant facts, particularly those relating to the kidnapping of the victim
girl from the vending cart of her parents. Thus, according to the learned
counsel, the fact that the deceased was last seen with the appellant is
established beyond any doubt. In relation to the argument that the
name of the appellant was not mentioned in the missing person report,
the learned counsel for the respondent would submit that this
contention is not correct inasmuch as the name of the appellant was
indeed mentioned in the missing report (Ext. P-1) lodged by PW 1 at
8.15 p.m., though it was mentioned as "Manoj Singh" instead of "Manoj
Pratap Singh"; and the FIR (Ext. P-2), which was registered on the
basis of the said report also carries the name of the appellant. The
learned counsel for the respondent would further submit that by way of
the documents available on record i.e. Exts. P-11, P-12 and P-13 and
the evidence of PW 18 Dr Narendra Paliwal, it is proved beyond doubt
that the deceased was a mentally and physically disadvantaged child,
who was also suffering from spastic palsy i.e. uncontrolled movement of
muscles and joints.
41.3. The learned Senior Counsel for the respondent State has
referred to the extensive injuries pointed out in the post-mortem report
(Ext. P-35) and has submitted that such injuries prove beyond any
doubt that the deceased was subjected to brutal rape and was
murdered mercilessly, as noticeable from the injuries on the occipital
and parietal region of the head of the deceased and as concluded by
the doctors of Medical Board that she died due to the injuries on her
head. The learned counsel has also strongly relied upon the FSL's report
on DNA examination (Ext. P-51) to submit that the matching of DNA
profile of the blood sample taken from the body of the deceased with
that of the blood samples taken from clothing of the appellant as also
with the blood samples taken from the motorcycle used in the crime, is
a rather clinching piece of evidence that leaves nothing to doubt that
the brutal rape and murder of the deceased could only be attributed to
the appellant.
42. The learned Senior Counsel for the respondent has further
submitted that there was no infraction of the requirements of Section
235(2) CrPC, as a sufficient time gap of 3 days was observed by the
trial court between the date of conviction and the date of awarding
death sentence, which too was awarded only after duly hearing the
appellant, duly appreciating all the material factors and circumstances,
and duly recording special reasons which take the present case into the
rarest of the rare category.
42.1. The learned Senior Counsel for the respondent, while
highlighting the aggravating circumstances of this case, has submitted
that the victim was a feeble minded and physically challenged girl; and
when the appellant was known to the victim, there was an element of
betrayal of trust. The learned counsel would also refer to the fact that
the victim girl was lured by way of first offering chocolates, to submit
that the entire modus operandi of the appellant was premeditated,
leading to brutal rape and murder of the hapless girl. The learned
counsel has further submitted that the extensive injuries on the private
parts of the victim were caused in a most diabolical and barbaric
manner, which shows the ghastly nature of crime; and the medical
expert evidence has
established that the deceased died due to the injuries caused on her
head. Thus, the appellant not only committed rape in a ghastly manner
but also clubbed the victim to death by brutal smashing of her head.
According to the learned counsel, on the facts of this case, the
circumstances as referred on behalf of the appellant could hardly be
said to be sufficiently mitigating the aggravated crime committed by
the appellant. Thus, there are no mitigating circumstances in this case
and nature of crime is such that it shocks the collective conscience of
society and shakes the very foundation of civilisation; and in this case,
awarding of death sentence is immensely justified.
42.2. The learned Senior Counsel for the respondent State has cited
various decisions in relation to the question concerning death sentence
and the principles evolved by the courts in that regard, including the
requirement of special reasons and rarest of rare doctrine, as elucidated
in Bachan Singh V. State of Punjab10, the requirement of balance sheet
of aggravating and mitigating circumstances, as explained in Machhi
Singh V. State of Punjab11; and the crime and criminal test, as
elaborated in Santosh Kumar Satishbhushan Bariyar V. State of
Maharashtra¹4
42.3. As regards the contentions urged on behalf of the appellant
invoking the doctrine of "residual doubt", the learned Senior Counsel for
the respondent State has contended that our criminal jurisprudence
recognises the requirement of "proof beyond reasonable doubt" to hold
any accused guilty; and any lingering doubt leads to the "benefit of
doubt" to the accused. Thus, there ought not be any uncertainty in
coming to the conclusion of guilt of the accused. According to the
learned counsel, in the face of such stringent requirements of proof
beyond reasonable doubt, there is no place for any "residual doubt"
after the finding of guilt and consequential conviction of the accused.
The learned counsel has contended that the concept of "residual doubt"
has not been found applicable in our country; and has referred to the
decision of this Court in Shatrughna Baban Meshram V. State of
Maharashtra¹
42.4. While supporting the death sentence in the present case, the
learned Senior Counsel for the respondent State has submitted that the
recurrent underlying principles are that in the cases of rape and murder
of a girl child, if death occurs due to rape alone, then death sentence is
normally not awarded but, if rape is followed by separate act of murder,
death sentence is countenanced, like the present case where, apart
from gruesome rape, the girl was done to death by causing horrific
injuries on her head. According to the learned counsel, the present case
is similar and akin to the cases where death sentence has been
awarded and maintained. In this regard, the learned counsel has
particularly referred to the decision in Kamta Tiwari V. State of M.P. 14 as
also two elaborate
decisions in Vasanta Sampat Dupare V. State of Maharashtra¹5 where,
in the case of rape and murder of a four-year-old girl child, death
sentence was affirmed by this Court while dismissing the main appeals
and then, the review petitions were also dismissed with the finding
that the aggravating circumstances were outweighing the alleged
mitigating circumstances.
42.5. The learned counsel for the respondent has also submitted in
the alternative that if at all death penalty is not affirmed by this Court,
the appellant ought to remain behind the bars for the remainder of his
life without any kind of remission, as per the course adopted by this
Court in Swamy Shraddananda (2) V. State of Karnataka¹7,
43. Apart from the factors relating to the heinous nature of crime
committed by the appellant, the learned counsel for the respondent, in
his written submissions, has pointed out other startling facts leading to
further aggravating circumstances in view of the conduct of the
appellant post-conviction. These circumstances, as regards post-
conviction conduct of the appellant, have been stated as under:
"B. Aggravating circumstances of the criminal
(a) Conduct of criminal post-conviction whilst in jail (committed
another murder with stone):
(i) On dated 17-4-2015 the detainee had quarrelled with
another detainee Meharajuddin, son of Chiragmuddin in Ward No.
10, whereupon the detainee was awarded 07 days punishment.
(ii) On dated 20-2-2019 the detainee had quarrelled along with
other detainees in the TV room of the Higher Security Ward (Ward
No. 10) constructed in the prison with detainee Shakar Ulla alias
Mohammed Hanif on account of watching TV and committed
murder of detainee by assaulting with the stone used to put over
TV. Detainee Manoj Pratap Singh, son of Surendra Pratap Singh
has been convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment by the
learned Special Judge (Prevention of Sati) & Addl. Sessions Judge,
Jaipur Metropolitan, Jaipur under Sections 302/34 IPC. He is a
recidivist i.e. prove to killing and people dangerous to society/jail
inmates."
(emphasis in the original written submissions)
43.1. The aforesaid factual aspects and circumstances relating to
post-conviction conduct of the appellant did not surface earlier during
the course of oral hearing and looking to their nature and impact, we
placed the matter for directions on 16-2-202218 18 and required filing of
an affidavit of the authorised officer of the State, giving all the
necessary particulars with the proceedings/judgment concerned, while
supplying advance copy to the appellant in jail. We also permitted the
appellant to file response thereto.
43.2. Pursuant to the directions aforesaid, an affidavit of the
Superintendent of Central Jail, Jaipur has been filed with a copy of the
judgment and order dated 10-1-2020 passed by the Court of Special
Judge (Prevention of Sati) and the Additional Sessions Judge, Jaipur
Metropolitan in Sessions Case No. 204 of 2019 (11 of 2019), making
out that the appellant has been convicted of the offence punishable
under Sections 302/34 IPC with three other inmates of Central Jail,
Jaipur. This conviction came to be recorded after the said trial court
found proved the prosecution case that the accused persons (including
the appellant) committed murder of another inmate of high security
ward, namely, Shakar Ulla alias Mohammed Hanif, a Pakistani national
who was undergoing sentence.
43.3. In response on behalf of the appellant to the facts
abovestated, reference has been made to para 40 of the said judgment
and order dated 10-1-2020 with the submissions that the allegations in
the said case had not been of any act by the appellant individually but
in a group; there was no eyewitness to the occurrence; the weapon
used was only a stone; and there was no evidence regarding specific
overt act on the part of the appellant. It has also been submitted that
the said judgment and order dated 10-1-2020 may not be taken into
consideration by this Court because the appellant has already filed an
appeal against the same, being Criminal Appeal (DB) No. 78 of 2020,
which remains pending with the High Court. It has also been submitted
that except such allegation of his involvement in the said case, overall
conduct of the appellant is without any blemish; that he is a reformed
person and not a menace to the society. It has also been urged that in
the given circumstances, psychological evaluation of the appellant may
be ordered before deciding finally the question of sentence.
44. We have given anxious consideration to the rival submissions
and have scanned through the entire record with reference to the law
applicable.
G. The scope and width of these appeals
45. As noticed, the trial court and the High Court have concurrently
recorded the findings in this case that the prosecution has been able to
successfully establish the chain of circumstances leading to the only
conclusion that the appellant is guilty of the offences of kidnapping,
rape and murder of the victim girl. The fundamental fact, as held
proved against the appellant is that the victim, a seven-and-a-half-year
-old mentally and physically challenged girl, was lastly seen in the
company of the appellant when he lured her and took her along with
himself on his motorcycle. The other significant fact, as held proved, is
that the dead body of the victim girl, her clothing, and the motorcycle
used in the crime were recovered at a faraway place at the instance of
the appellant. Coupled with these two aspects are the factors that there
were bloodstains on the clothes of the appellant when he was found at
the bus-stand after about 7 1/2 hours of the incident of kidnapping and
that bloodstains were also found on the body of the motorcycle; and
the DNA profile obtained from these bloodstains matched with the DNA
profile of the blood sample of the victim girl. Added to these had been
the circumstance that the appellant failed
to explain his whereabouts since he was last seen with the victim girl
as also about his knowledge of the location of her dead body. These
facts and factors, taken together with the medical evidence that there
were several injuries all over the body of the victim girl including
gruesome injuries on her private parts and horrific injuries on her head,
are said to be of a complete chain of circumstances, leading to the
conclusion on the guilt of the appellant in relation to the offences of
kidnapping, rape and murder.
46. As could be readily noticed, the concurrent findings leading to
the appellant's conviction have been challenged as if it were a matter of
regular appeal; and as if inviting reappreciation of entire evidence on
its contents as also its surrounding factors. However, we cannot lose
sight of the fact that the present one is a matter of concurrent findings
of fact by the trial court and the High Court. Though the parameters of
examining the matters in an appeal by special leave under Article 136
of the Constitution of India have been laid down repeatedly by this
Court in several of the decisions but, having regard to the submissions
made in this case, we may usefully iterate what has been observed in
Pappu V. State of U.P. 19 wherein, after referring to Articles 134 and 136
of the Constitution of India and Section 2 of the Supreme Court
(Enlargement of Criminal Appellate Jurisdiction) Act, 1970 as also with
a detailed reference to several of the relevant decisions20, this Court
has summed up the subtle but relevant distinction in the scope of a
regular appeal and an appeal by special leave in the following words
:
"71. In summation of what has been noticed hereinabove, it is but
clear that as against any judgment/final order or sentence in a
criminal proceeding of the High Court, regular appeals to this Court
are envisaged in relation to the eventualities specified in Article 134
of the Constitution of India and Section 2 of the 1970 Act. The
present one is not a matter covered thereunder and the present
appeals are by special leave in terms of Article 136 of the
Constitution of India. In such an appeal by special leave, where the
trial court and the High Court have concurrently returned the
findings of fact after appreciation of evidence, each and every finding
of fact cannot be contested nor such an appeal could be dealt with as
if another forum for reappreciation of evidence. Of course, if the
assessment by the trial court and the High Court could be said to be
vitiated by any error of law or procedure or misreading of evidence or
in disregard to the norms of judicial process leading to serious
prejudice or injustice, this Court may, and in appropriate cases
would, interfere in order to prevent grave or serious miscarriage of
justice but, such a course is adopted only in rare and exceptional
cases of manifest illegality. Tersely put, it is not a
matter of regular appeal. This Court would not interfere with the
concurrent findings of fact based on pure appreciation of evidence nor it
is the scope of these appeals that this Court would enter into
reappreciation of evidence so as to take a view different than that taken
by the trial court and approved21 by the High Court."
47. Keeping the aforesaid principles in view, we may examine if the
concurrent findings call for any interference while reiterating that
wholesome reappreciation of evidence is not within the scope of these
appeals, even though we have scanned through the entire evidence in
order to appropriately deal with the rival submissions.
H. Procedural questions relating to investigation and trial
48. Before dealing with the contentions relating to the evidence on
record, we deem it appropriate to address the procedural aspects put in
question by the learned counsel for the appellant, particularly relating
to the investigation and the trial in this matter.
48.1. The contentions urged by the learned counsel for the appellant
against the process of investigation have only been noted to be
rejected. The chronology of the events and steps in the investigation
leave nothing to doubt that the investigating officers of this case (the
SHO PW 20 Ganesh Nath and the Circle Officer PW 25 Umesh Ojha) and
other police officers have indeed methodically discharged their duties.
Rather than finding faults or shortcomings in the investigation, we
could only appreciate the thoroughness of investigation, where every
step was appropriately and punctually taken and all the relevant
processes were methodically documented; and where the charge-sheet
was swiftly presented to the Court with all relevant particulars.
48.2. As per the evidence on record, the information referable to
Section 27 of the Evidence Act, 1872 (hereinafter also referred to as
"the Evidence Act") as furnished by the appellant at 2.30 a.m. on 18-1-
2013 was duly recorded by PW 20 Ganesh Nath (Ext. P-40). Thereafter,
the appellant was taken to the location of the dead body of the victim
girl and the same was recovered as per the said information furnished
by the appellant. There is no substance in the contention against the
process taken up by PW 20 Ganesh Nath after the arrest of the
appellant. Similarly, there does not appear to be any unusual manner in
which evidence against the appellant for other cases was collected. As
noticed, last one of the other cases against the appellant was that of
theft of the very same motorcycle, which was used in the present
crime. The other thread of contentions against the process of
investigation, about placing reliance on the personal opinion of doctors,
is very difficult to be appreciated. The doctors of the Medical Board
were rather under bounden duty to state their opinion, particularly as
regards the nature and duration of injuries and the cause of death.
48.3. The suggestions that the charge-sheet was filed within 12
days of his arrest and even without receipt of DNA report and that the
appellant should have been given more time to study the police report
stand rather at conflict with the
desirability of prompt proceedings by the investigating agency and also
by the trial court in such matters. The constitutional guarantees of
equality before law, protection of life and personal liberty, protection in
respect of conviction, and protection against the arrest and detention,
do not expand into a corresponding right with an accused person to
question the swiftness of investigation and expeditious proceedings of
the trial or to suggest that he has to be tried at a pace of his choice. It
sounds rather preposterous that an accused would question the trial
proceedings only because of the pace maintained by the prosecution
and the trial court so as to take the trial to its logical conclusion at the
earliest. While rejecting the contentions urged on behalf of the
appellant, we would rather observe that the speed and pace expected
in the cases like the present one, per force, require utmost expedition
by the investigating agency as also by the trial court.
48.4. The contention that the appellant was deprived of his right of
defence and he was given services of an inexperienced counsel remain
too far-stretched and rather unjustified. Apart from that no such
grievance was ever suggested before the trial court or even before the
High Court, we find from the record that legal aid counsel was
appointed at the request of the appellant himself and in fact, the trial
court proceeded with the matter only after appointment of a counsel for
the appellant. A perusal of the record further makes it clear that the
legal aid counsel left no stone unturned to defend the appellant and
thoroughly cross-examined each and every witness to the minutest and
minor details. He contested every proposition of the prosecution and
even the application for recalling of PW 1 (only for the purpose of
identification of the clothes of the deceased, which were received later
from FSL) was also thoroughly contested by him by filing a reply and
contending that the prosecution was trying to fill up a lacuna in their
case. Hereinbefore, we have referred to the extensive contentions urged
on behalf of the appellant-accused by the legal aid counsel, as dealt
with by the trial court in its judgment dated 28-9-2013 22
49. Having examined the record, we find the criticism in this appeal
against the conduct of case by the legal aid counsel to be unwarranted
and rather unfair. The said counsel had indeed faithfully discharged his
duties and had thoroughly defended the appellant. As regards the
defence version, it has not been shown if the appellant ever suggested
to the counsel about his desire to have one or more meetings with him
or to confer with him about any particular line of defence. We are
constrained to observe that the negative comments qua the said legal
aid counsel cannot be countenanced and raising of such contentions in
this appeal is difficult to be appreciated; these contentions are rejected
in toto.
I. Concurrent findings of fact : whether requiring interference?
50. Moving on to the submissions assailing the findings on guilt of
the appellant, we may reiterate that the present case is based on
circumstantial evidence where the trial court and the High Court have
concurrently recorded their findings that the prosecution has been able
to successfully establish the chain of circumstances leading to the
unmistakable conclusion that the
appellant is guilty of the offences of kidnapping, rape and murder of the
victim girl. However, the learned counsel for the appellant has
endeavoured to project certain so-called shortcomings and lacunae in
the prosecution case. While dealing with such submissions, we may
usefully take note of the basic principles relating to a case based on
circumstantial evidence.
51. The principles explained and enunciated in Sharad Birdhichand
Sarda V. State of Maharashtra²3 remain a guiding light for the courts in
regard to the proof of a case based on circumstantial evidence, wherein
this Court referred to the celebrated decision in Hanumant V. State of
M.P. and deduced five golden principles, panchsheel, of proving a
24
case based on circumstantial evidence in the following passages
:
"152.
It may be useful to extract what Mahajan, J. has laid
`12. It is well to remember that in cases where the evidence is
of a circumstantial nature, the circumstances from which the
conclusion of guilt is to be drawn should in the first instance be
fully established, and all the facts so established should be
consistent only with the hypothesis of the guilt of the accused.
Again, the circumstances should be of a conclusive nature and
tendency and they should be such as to exclude every hypothesis
but the one proposed to be proved. In other words, there must be
a chain of evidence so far complete as not to leave any reasonable
ground for a conclusion consistent with the innocence of the
accused and it must be such as to show that within all human
probability the act must have been done by the accused.'
153. A close analysis of this decision would show that the
following conditions must be fulfilled before a case against an
accused can be said to be fully established:
(1) the circumstances from which the conclusion of guilt is to
be drawn should be fully established.
It may be noted here that this Court indicated that the circumstances concerned
"must or should" and not "may be" established. There is not only a grammatical but
a legal distinction between "may be proved" and "must be or should be proved" as
was held by this Court in Shivaji Sahabrao Bobade V. State of Maharashtra 25
`19.
Certainly, it is a primary principle that the accused must be
and not merely may be guilty before a court can convict and the
mental distance between "may be" and "must be" is long and
divides vague conjectures from sure conclusions."
(2) the facts so established should be consistent only with the
hypothesis of the guilt of the accused, that is to say, they should
not be explainable on any other hypothesis except that the
accused is guilty,
(3) the circumstances should be of a conclusive nature and
tendency,
(4) they should exclude every possible hypothesis except the
one to be proved, and
(5) there must be a chain of evidence so complete as not to
leave any reasonable ground for the conclusion consistent with
the innocence of the accused and must show that in all human
probability the act must have been done by the accused.
154. These five golden principles, if we may say so, constitute the
panchsheel of the proof of a case based on circumstantial evidence.
155. It may be interesting to note that as regards the mode of
proof in a criminal case depending on circumstantial evidence, in the
absence of a corpus delicti, the statement of law as to proof of the
same was laid down by Gresson, J. (and concurred by 3 more
Judges) in R. V. Horry26 thus:
'Before he can be convicted, the fact of death should be proved by
such circumstances as render the commission of the crime morally
certain and leave no ground for reasonable doubt : the
circumstantial evidence should be so cogent and compelling as to
convince a jury that upon no rational hypothesis other than murder
can the facts be accounted for.'
156. Lord Goddard slightly modified the expression "morally
certain" by "such circumstances as render the commission of the
crime certain".
157. This indicates the cardinal principle of criminal jurisprudence
that a case can be said to be proved only when there is certain and
explicit evidence and no person can be convicted on pure moral
conviction."
(emphasis in original)
52. Keeping the aforesaid principles in view, when we examine the
contentions of the learned counsel for the appellant, we find nothing of
substance therein.
53. It has been contended on behalf of the appellant that his name
was not mentioned in the first missing person report lodged in this
matter, as admitted by PW 1 Kamla and PW 3 Madan Lal; and that the
said first report has not been placed on record. This contention has its
roots in the last line occurring in the statement made by PW 1 Kamla in
her cross-examination that she had lodged a missing person report in
which the name of the appellant was not stated. It may also have its
basis in the statement made by PW 3 Madan Lal in his cross-
examination that after the accused Manoj Pratap Singh took away the
child, they went to Police Post Bandiyabada, where missing report was
lodged.
53.1. The contention is, however, totally detached from reality as
also from the factual matrix. It has been consistently maintained that
the appellant kidnapped the victim girl at about 6.30 p.m. from the
vending cart of PW 1 Kamla. It has been proved by all the relevant
witnesses that the attempts were made to chase the appellant but he
could not be stopped. Though no such report made in writing at Police
Post Bandiyabada is on record but, even if it be assumed that they first
went to the said police post (as stated by PW 3), so far giving the name
of the appellant as the person kidnapping the child is concerned, PW 3
had been specific that his name was known to them and was given to
the police post too. Reference to some report at the said police post
carries hardly any adverse impact on the prosecution case because the
information stated in the form of complaint by PW 1 Kamla
accompanied by PW 3 Madan Lal was indeed recorded in writing by PW
19 Nand Lal at 8.15 p.m. at the police station. It has been established
that the police station was at a distance of about 7 km from the place
of kidnapping. It has also been pointed out by PW 1 that it took about
30 to 45 minutes to reach the police station in an auto and the oral
report was made at 8.15 p.m. In view of the specific facts stated in
unison by the relevant prosecution witnesses that the name and
identity of the kidnapper was known to them, coupled with the time
that elapsed from the moment of kidnapping (around 6.30 p.m.) and
until lodging of the report at the police station (around 8.15 p.m.) while
providing for commuting time, there was neither any occasion nor any
reason for the prosecution witnesses to omit the name of the appellant.
53.2. The report (Ext. P-1) and the FIR registered on its basis (Ext.
P-2) had been specific, not only giving the name of the appellant
(though in the report, the name given was Manoj Singh and not Manoj
Pratap Singh) but further to that, the informant also stated her
knowledge that the person concerned was the one who was earlier
living in the Housing Board Colony. In the face of the contents of the
report, Ext. P-1 and the FIR, Ext. P-2 as also the consistent testimony
of PW 1 Kamla, PW 2 Dharam Das, PW 3 Madan Lal, PW 5 Maniraj Singh
and PW 17 Dinesh Bhatia, who stated in no uncertain terms that it was
the appellant who kidnapped the victim girl, the contention urged on
behalf of the appellant could only be rejected. Moreover, PW 12 Ranjit
Singh has established a crucial fact that around the very same time as
that of kidnapping of the victim girl, the appellant reached the liquor
shop and purchased beer while a girl child was sitting on his
motorcycle. The testimony of this witness has also remained unshaken
in the cross-examination. The appellant has not been able to show as to
why this independent witness would at all be deposing against him.
The appellant has further failed to explain if the girl child sitting on his
motorcycle at the time of purchasing beer from the shop of PW 12
Ranjit Singh was not the victim girl but anyone else.
53.3. Thus, the evidence on record is categorical and clear that the
victim girl was last seen alive only with the appellant.
54. The other part of contention with reference to the medical and
other scientific evidence also carry no substance whatsoever. It has
been argued, by relying on one sentence in the deposition of one of the
doctors of Medical Board during cross-examination that the death might
have been caused as a result of rape, that the appellant had not
intended to cause death. The post-mortem report (Ext. P-35), as
reproduced hereinbefore leaves nothing to doubt that the hapless
victim sustained extensive injuries all over her body and the injuries
particularly on her head as also on the private parts had been rather
horrific. Her death ultimately had been due to head injuries, as opined
by the doctors of the Medical Board. We have reproduced hereinbefore
the relevant part of the statement of PW 14 Dr Manju Purohit, a
member of the Medical Board conducting post-mortem examination27.
The expressions "brutal", "inhuman", "cruel", etc. came in her
statement with reference to the Court question, where she was asked
her expert medical opinion after conducting external and internal
examination of injuries and after analysing the circumstances and
condition of body; and she opined with reference to the injuries that
"the eight-year-old innocent girl had been brutally and inhumanly
raped and on objecting, the person who raped her behaved in an
inhuman and cruel manner as a result of which, she sustained different
simple and grievous injuries due to which she died". She further
pointed out her opinion about brutality while stating that "laceration of
the vagina of the deceased shows that she was brutally raped in an
inhuman manner". However, in her further cross-examination, this
witness categorically affirmed the opinion stated by the Medical Board
in the post-mortem report about the cause of death and clearly stated
that "the cause of death was injury caused on the head". In the given
set of circumstances and cogent expert medical evidence, the absence
of semen on the body of the victim or in the vaginal swab is hardly of
any bearing on the substance of the matter. Hence, the contentions
urged on behalf of the appellant in relation to the medical evidence
remain baseless and stand rejected. In continuity, we may also observe
that the submissions suggestive of the victim having received only
bruises and abrasions apart from injury on head are also incorrect. A
bare reference to the extensive post-mortem report (Ext. P-35) and the
statements of the doctors of the Medical Board PW 14, PW 15 and PW
21 are sufficient to reject these suggestions.
54.1. Apart from the above, one line occurring in the deposition of
PW 21 Dr Chetna Vaishnav has been picked up to build an argument on
behalf of the appellant that the death of the victim girl might have
been caused as a result of rape; and it has been submitted that causing
death cannot be taken to be the intention of the appellant. The
argument is premised on a wrong and incomplete reading of the
statement of PW 21 Dr Chetna Vaishnav. She too had been categorical
in her examination-in-chief about the post-mortem report and had
deposed consistently with PW 14 Dr Manju Purohit and PW 15 Dr
Kailash Chand that as per Medical Board, the head injury was the cause
of death. She reasserted this fact in her cross-examination too, while
stating that
"in the opinion of Medical Board, multiple injuries were found on the
head of the deceased which collectively resulted in death of the
deceased". She had, of course, stated in her examination-in-chief that
"the deceased was subjected to brutal rape and her death was caused"
but, reading her testimony as a whole, it is but clear that in this
sentence, what she intended to convey was about two different acts i.e.
of committing rape and of causing death. She had not stated that death
was caused by rape.
54.2. Having examined the post-mortem report and the testimonies
of the doctors conducting post-mortem, we are clearly of the view that
even by distortion of language occurring in their testimonies, it cannot
be deduced that there was any doubt or difference of opinion in the
Medical Board about the cause of death. In other words, the doctors
had been clear, categorical and consistent that the victim girl died due
to the injuries caused on her head.
55. As regards another contention about the doubts on collection of
blood samples from the metal surface of the motorcycle in question
because of the alleged rain or drizzling or storm, first of all it may be
mentioned that there had not been any specific evidence about any
excessive rain in the nature of storm. It has, of course, been stated by
the witnesses that at the time of kidnapping of the victim girl, it was
raining/drizzling. However, there is no such evidence that at the time of
arrest of the appellant, or at the time of his disclosure statement at
about 2.00 a.m. on 18-1-2013, or at the time of recovery of dead body
at about 3.15 a.m. on 18-1-2013, or at the time of recovery of
motorcycle at about 4.45 p.m. on 19-1-2013, or at the time of
collection of blood sample from the motorcycle at about 5.00 p.m. on
19-1-2013, there had been any such rain or drizzle for which, the
requisite samples could not have been collected. This is apart from the
fact that FSL had clearly and undoubtedly performed DNA test on the
blood sample collected from motorcycle (packet marked D, Ext. 6 in the
FSL report Ext. P-51). Thus, the submission doubting the collection of
blood sample from the motorcycle is also totally baseless and stands
rejected.
56. The other submission seeking to question the factum of mental
and physical disabilities of the victim girl does not carry any substance
at all. Apart from the fact that mental and physical disabilities of the
child have been consistently stated by her parents and grandfather, the
fact of the matter remains that way back on 4-3-2010, the Medical
Board found her suffering from spastic palsy (vide Ext. P-11); and PW
18 Dr Narendra Paliwal indeed proved the said certificate. In fact, the
investigating officer PW 25 Umesh Ojha took care to seek medical
opinion/comments regarding the nature of disablement of the victim
girl with reference to the said certificate Ext. P-11 by way of a
communication dated 22-1-2013 (Ext. 52) and thereupon, the Medical
Officer made his endorsement to the effect that "her coordination
movements of limbs which are controlled by brain were disturbed and
as such she was physically and mentally challenged child". The
submissions as regards evidentiary value of school certificates carry no
meaning when the matter is examined with reference to the overall
evidence on record, which leaves nothing to doubt that the victim girl
was a mentally and physically challenged child. Percentage of
disablement is not the matter in issue here. The relevant facts are that
she was
suffering from mental and physical disabilities and was below 8 years of
age. These facts are duly proved on record.
57. Hence, the contentions urged on behalf of the appellant seeking
to question the concurrent findings by reference to certain non-existent
or irrelevant factors need to be rejected altogether.
58. We may usefully summarise the facts and factors established
beyond doubt on record forming the complete chain of circumstances
that:
(a) the deceased was seven-and-a-half-year-old mentally and
physically challenged girl;
(b) the deceased was last seen with the appellant when he
kidnapped her from the lawful guardianship of her parents;
(c) the appellant was arrested within about 7 1/2 hours of kidnap;
(d) the clothes worn by the appellant were bloodstained, which
were seized and sealed;
(e) after about 1 1/2 hours of his arrest, the dead body of the victim
girl was recovered at a faraway place on the disclosure and
information of the appellant;
(f) the motorcycle used by the appellant and the frock worn by
the victim girl were also recovered at a faraway place at the
disclosure and information of the appellant;
(g) the appellant failed to account for his own whereabouts as
also the whereabouts of the victim girl since after the time of
kidnap;
(h) the appellant also failed to show the reason of his knowledge
about the place/places where the dead body, the motorcycle and the
frock were recovered;
(i) as per the evidence on record, it had been a case of brutal rape
(with gruesome injuries on and around private parts) and merciless
killing (with horrific injuries on head) of the victim girl;
(j) the victim died due to the injuries on her head;
(k) the DNA profile of blood collected from the person and
clothing of the victim girl matched with the DNA profile of blood
found on the coat, pants and shirt of the appellant and on the
motorcycle
This chain is so complete in itself that no stretch of imagination could
take us to any other hypothesis except the guilt of the appellant in
relation to the offences charged. Hence, the concurrent findings of the
trial court and the High Court holding the appellant guilty are
imminently just and proper; and call for no interference whatsoever.
59. We may also indicate at least two other facts established on
record which not only strengthen the complete chain of circumstances
noticed above but, have their own bearing in this matter. The first one
of these facts, which is duly attached to the chain of circumstances, is
that the motorcycle used in this crime bearing Registration No. RJ30 3M
5944 was itself stolen on 14-1-2013 for which, a theft report had
already been lodged at Police Station Nathdwara, as distinctly proved
by PW 23 Ramdev Regar, Sub-Inspector of Police. It has been duly
established on record that the appellant indeed used that motorcycle in
kidnapping the victim girl and the motorcycle was recovered as per the
information supplied by the appellant. It has not been a case of the
appellant that the motorcycle belonged to him or was given to him by
its owner. Thus, undoubtedly, the appellant used stolen motorcycle in
committing this crime. The second one of these facts, duly established
by the testimony of PW 12 Ranjeet Singh, had been that after
kidnapping the victim girl from the lawful guardianship of her parents,
the appellant headed towards the liquor shop with the victim girl sitting
on the motorcycle; he purchased a bottle of beer and he even
quarrelled as regards the price; and he left the liquor shop with a bottle
of beer and with the victim girl sitting on the motorcycle. These facts
and factors only worsen the criminality of conduct duly found proved
against the appellant.
60. For what has been discussed hereinabove, we have not an iota of
doubt that the present case of circumstantial evidence answers to the
23
panchsheel principles of Sharad Birdhichand Sarda The appellant was
rightly convicted by the trial court and his conviction has rightly been
maintained by the High Court. To put it in other words, having
examined the matter in its totality, we are satisfied that the
prosecution has been able to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt,
rather beyond any doubt whatsoever. The chain of circumstances
projected bv the prosecution is complete in its entiretv and leads only
to the result that the appellant had been the person who kidnapped,
raped and murdered the victim, seven-and-a-half-year-old mentally
and physically challenged girl. Hence, the concurrent findings leading
to conviction of the appellant of the offences aforementioned call for no
interference; and deserve to be confirmed.
61. Even when we uphold the concurrent findings leading to
conviction of the appellant, the question remains about the death
sentence awarded to him for the offence under Section 302 IPC, which
has been seriously challenged in these appeals. Before proceeding to
deal with this major question calling for determination in this case, we
may dispose of one of the unnecessary submissions made on behalf of
the appellant as regards his conviction both
under Pocso and IPC. This submission, made with reference to Section
42 Pocso, is also baseless. The mandate for awarding punishment
which is greater in degree does not correspondingly lead to the
proposition that the appellant could not have been convicted of the
offence under Section 376 IPC as also under Section 6 Pocso. This
aspect need not detain us much longer because the core question in
this case after confirmation of conviction is as to whether death
sentence awarded for the offence under Section 302 IPC be maintained
or be substituted by any other sentence.
J. Whether death sentence be maintained or substituted by any
other sentence
62. As noticed, two-fold submissions have been put at the forefront
by the learned Senior Counsel for the appellant in challenge to the
death sentence awarded in this case. First, that the present case is
based on circumstantial evidence rather than absolute proof and
therefore, benefit of "residual doubt" ought to be given to the appellant
and capital sentence should not be awarded because, the present case
may be a rare one but is not the rarest of the rare. Secondly, the
learned Senior Counsel has referred to the mitigating factors wherefor
the appellant deserves to be spared from capital sentence, being those
of his young age at the time of commission of the crime in question;
his poor economic background; his having family with wife, minor
daughter and aged father; and strong probability of his reformation. Per
contra, the learned Senior Counsel for the respondent State has
highlighted the aggravating circumstances that the appellant had
kidnapped, raped and murdered a mentally and physically challenged
girl child; that his acts and actions disclose his planning and
premeditated actions; and that the ghastly crime was committed in a
diabolical and barbaric manner. Apart from other factors, the learned
Senior Counsel for the respondent State has highlighted the facts about
post-conviction felonious conduct of the appellant where once he was
awarded 7 days' punishment for quarrelling with another detainee and
then, he was convicted of the offence under Sections 302/34 IPC for
killing of another jail inmate. The learned counsel for the respondent
would submit that the appellant has proven himself to be a recidivist,
the person who is prone to killing people, has committed crimes in the
past and has shown the tendency to relapse into crime repeatedly, and
is dangerous to society.
Apropos the rival submissions and the fact that the sentence
under consideration is that of termination of a natural life, it is obvious
that the matter calls for a serious and heightened scrutiny of all the
relevant aspects, with reference to the statutory requirements as also
the legal principles enunciated by this Court.
J.1. Death sentence : Evolution of principles and norms
64. As regards the statutory requirements, as per sub-section (2) of
Section 235 CrPC, on being convicted and not being released on
probation or after admonition in terms of Section 360 CrPC, the accused
has to be heard by the Judge concerned on the question of sentence
and then, sentence has to be passed according to law. Moreover, as per
sub-section (3) of Section 354 CrPC,
if the conviction is for an offence punishable with death or in the
alternative, with imprisonment for life or imprisonment for a particular
term of years, the judgment has to state the reasons for the sentence
awarded; and in case of death sentence, the judgment has to state
"special reasons" therefor.
65. Sub-section (2) of Section 235 CrPC, providing for mandatory
hearing of the accused before passing sentence, reads as under:
"235. (2) If the accused is convicted, the Judge shall, unless he
proceeds in accordance with the provisions of Section 360, hear the
accused on the question of sentence, and then pass sentence on him
according to law."
66. Sub-section (3) of Section 354 CrPC, requiring reasons for
sentence and "special reasons" in case of death sentence, reads as
under:
"354. (3) When the conviction is for an offence punishable with
death or, in the alternative, with imprisonment for life or
imprisonment for a term of years, the judgment shall state the
reasons for the sentence awarded, and, in the case of sentence of
death, the special reasons for such sentence."
67. We may now usefully summarise the salient features of evolution
of legal principles and norms for dealing with the question of
sentencing in such matters where the sentence of death could also be
awarded, particularly with reference to the leading cases and
expositions therein.
68. In Jagmohan Singh V. State of U.P.29 the questions in their
broader spectrum were raised about the constitutional impermissibility
of death sentence with the submissions:
68.1. That the death sentence was unreasonable for it would put an
end to all the rights guaranteed under clauses (a) to (g) of Article 19
(1) of the Constitution of India.
68.2. That the discretion vested in the Judges to impose capital
punishment was not based on any standards or policy and hence, the
provision suffered from the vice of excessive delegation of legislative
function.
68.3. That the uncontrolled and unguided discretion in the Judges to
impose capital punishment or imprisonment for life was hit by Article
14 of the Constitution of India.
68.4. That under Article 21 of the Constitution, no person shall be
deprived of his life except according to the procedure established by
law but, the provisions of law did not provide a procedure for trial of
factors and circumstances crucial for making the choice between the
capital punishment and imprisonment for life.
69. The Constitution Bench in Jagmohan Singh case rejected the
aforesaid and corollary arguments while pointing out, inter alia, that the
provisions in the Constitution of India, like those of Articles 72(1)(c),
72(3), 21, 134 as also the then applicable provisions of Sections 401
and 402 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898 were indicative that
capital sentence had not been regarded per se unreasonable or not in
public interest; and that the policy of law
in giving a very wide discretion in the matter of punishment to the
Judge has its origin in the impossibility of laying down standards,
rather exercise of judicial discretion on well-recognised principles is the
safest possible safeguards for the accused. 30
70. As regards the contentions urged on the anvil of Article 21 of the
Constitution of India, the Bench in Jagmohan Singh case29 observed
that the Court in such matters would be principally concerned with the
facts and circumstances, whether aggravating or mitigating, which are
connected with the particular crime under inquiry and which are
capable of being proved in accordance with the laws of procedure; and
finally the parties on both sides were having opportunity to address the
Court whereafter the Judge would decide on the guilt and punishment.
The Constitution Bench observed that the relevant provisions were part
of the procedure established by law and those provisions were not
shown to be constitutionally invalid. Thus, the Bench concluded that
"the death sentence imposed after trial in accordance with the
procedure established by law is not unconstitutional under Article 21."
71. Two major factors/events after the decision in Jagmohan²9 led to
another reference to the Constitution Bench of this Court in regard to
the constitutional validity of death penalty for the offence of murder as
also of the sentencing procedure. One had been the amendment of the
law relating to criminal procedure with the advent of the Code of the
Criminal Procedure, 1973 in replacement of the old Code of 1898, which
introduced, as regards sentencing procedure, the above-quoted sub-
section (2) of Section 235 and sub-section (3) of Section 354. Several
persons convicted of murder and sentenced to death filed the petitions
under Article 32 of the Constitution of India challenging the
constitutional validity of death penalty provided in Section 302 IPC for
the offence of murder and that of the sentencing procedure provided in
sub-section (3) of Section 354 CrPC. The other one had been the
majority opinion of a three-Judge Bench of this Court in Rajendra
Prasad V. State of U.P.3 purportedly seeking to whittle down the ratio
of Jagmohan and correctness of such an opinion having been
doubted by another Bench of this Court. The reference so made to the
Constitution Bench came to be answered in
locus classicus Bachan Singh1 10 with its "rarest of rare" doctrine. The
opinion of the majority in Bachan Singh1 10 is the guiding light and
foundational discipline for all the later developments and enunciations
on the subject.
72. In Bachan Singh the Constitution Bench of this Court
10
examined two major questions i.e. as to whether death penalty
provided for the offence of murder under Section 302 IPC was
unconstitutional; and if not, as to whether the sentencing procedure in
Section 354(3) CrPC was unconstitutional on the ground that it
invested the Court with unguided and untrammelled discretion.
73. After having examined a variety of features and factors
pertaining to Articles 19(1) and 21 of the Constitution of India, the
Court (per majority of the Constitution Bench) answered the first
question in the negative, while observing and pointing out, inter alia, as
"132. To sum up, the question whether or not death penalty
serves any penological purpose is a difficult, complex and intractable
issue. It has evoked strong, divergent views. For the purpose of
testing the constitutionality of the impugned provision as to death
penalty in Section 302 of the Penal Code on the ground of
reasonableness in the light of Articles 19 and 21 of the Constitution,
it is not necessary for us to express any categorical opinion, one way
or the other, as to which of these two antithetical views, held by the
Abolitionists and Retentionists, is correct. It is sufficient to say that
the very fact that persons of reason, learning and light are rationally
and deeply divided in their opinion on this issue, is a ground among
others, for rejecting the petitioners' argument that retention of death
penalty in the impugned provision, is totally devoid of reason and
purpose. If, notwithstanding the view of the Abolitionists to the
contrary, a very large segment of people, the world over, including
sociologists, legislators, jurists, Judges and administrators still firmly
believe in the worth and necessity of capital punishment for the
protection of society, if in the perspective of prevailing crime
conditions in India, contemporary public opinion channelised through
the people's representatives in Parliament, has repeatedly in the last
three decades, rejected all attempts, including the one made
recently, to abolish or specifically restrict the area of death penalty,
if death penalty is still a recognised legal sanction for murder or
some types of murder in most of the civilised countries in the world,
if the Framers of the Indian Constitution were fully aware - as we
shall presently show they were - of the existence of death penalty
as punishment for murder, under the Penal Code, 1860, if the 35th
Report and subsequent reports of the Law Commission suggesting
retention of death penalty, and recommending revision of the
Criminal Procedure Code and the insertion of the new Sections 235
(2) and 354(3) in that Code providing for presentence hearing and
sentencing procedure on conviction for murder and other capital
offences were before Parliament and presumably considered by it
when in 1972-1973 it took up revision of the Code of 1898 and
replaced it by the Code of Criminal
Procedure, 1973, it is not possible to hold that the provision of death
penalty as an alternative punishment for murder, in Section 302 of the
Penal Code is unreasonable and not in the public interest. We would,
therefore, conclude that the impugned provision in Section 302,
violates neither the letter nor the ethos of Article 19.
*
*
136. Article 21 reads as under:
'21. Protection of life and personal liberty.- - No person shall
be deprived of his life or personal liberty except according to
procedure established by law.'
If this Article is expanded in accordance with the interpretative principle indicated
in Maneka Gandhi³². it will read as follows:
No person shall be deprived of his life or personal liberty except
according to fair, just and reasonable procedure established by valid
law.
In the converse positive form, the expanded Article will read as below:
A person may be deprived of his life or personal liberty in
accordance with fair, just and reasonable procedure established by
valid law.
Thus expanded and read for interpretative purposes, Article 21 clearly brings out
the implication, that the Founding Fathers recognised the right of the State to
deprive a person of his life or personal liberty in accordance with fair, just and
reasonable procedure established by valid law. There are several other indications,
also, in the Constitution which show that the Constitution-makers were fully
cognizant of the existence of death penalty for murder and certain other offences
in the Penal Code, 1860. Entries 1 and 2 in List III - Concurrent List - of the
Seventh Schedule, specifically refer to the Penal Code, 1860 and the Code of
Criminal Procedure as in force at the commencement of the Constitution. Article
72(1)(c) specifically invests the President with power to suspend, remit or
commute the sentence of any person convicted of any offence, and also "in all
cases where the sentence is a sentence of death". Likewise, under Article 161, the
Governor of a State has been given power to suspend, remit or commute, inter
alia, the sentence of death of any person convicted of murder or other capital
offence relating to a matter to which the executive power of the State extends.
Article 134, in terms, gives a right of appeal to the Supreme Court to a person
who, on appeal, is sentenced to death by the High Court, after reversal of his
acquittal by the trial court. Under the successive Criminal Procedure Codes which
have been in force for about 100 years, a sentence of death is to be carried out
by hanging. In view of the aforesaid constitutional postulates. by no stretch of
imagination can it be said that death penalty under Section 302 of the Penal Code,
either per se or because of its execution by hanging, constitutes an unreasonable,
cruel or unusual punishment. By reason of the same constitutional postulates,
it cannot be said that the Framers of the Constitution considered death
sentence for murder or the prescribed traditional mode of its execution
as a degrading punishment which would defile "the dignity of the
individual" within the contemplation of the Preamble to the
Constitution. On parity of reasoning, it cannot be said that death
penalty for the offence of murder violates the basic structure of the
Constitution."
74. In relation to the second question, the Court examined the
development of law, particularly the change of legislative policy with
introduction of Section 354(3) CrPC as also the Law Commission's
Reports and various past decisions; and summarised the propositions
laid down in Jagmohan²9 in the following terms : (Bachan Singh case10 ,
"160. In the light of the above conspectus, we will now consider
the effect of the aforesaid legislative changes on the authority and
efficacy of the propositions laid down by this Court in Jagmohan
case29 These propositions may be summed up as under:
(i) The general legislative policy that underlines the structure of
our criminal law, principally contained in the Indian Penal Code and
the Criminal Procedure Code, is to define an offence with sufficient
clarity and to prescribe only the maximum punishment therefor, and
to allow a very wide discretion to the Judge in the matter of fixing
the degree of punishment.
With the solitary exception of Section 303, the same policy
permeates Section 302 and some other sections of the Penal Code,
where the maximum punishment is the death penalty.
(ii) (a) No exhaustive enumeration of aggravating or mitigating
circumstances which should be considered when sentencing an
offender, is possible. 'The infinite variety of cases and facets to each
case would make general standards either meaningless "boiler plate"
or a statement of the obvious that no Jury (Judge) would
need.' (referred to McGautha V. California 3³)
(b) The impossibility of laying down standards is at the very core
of the criminal law as administered in India which invests the Judges
with a very wide discretion in the matter of fixing the degree of
punishment.
(iii) The view taken by the plurality in Furman V. Georgia³4
decided by the Supreme Court of the United States, to the effect,
that a law which gives uncontrolled and unguided discretion to the
Jury (or the Judge) to choose arbitrarily between a sentence of death
and imprisonment for a capital offence, violates the Eighth
Amendment, is not applicable in India. We do not have in our
Constitution any provision like the Eighth Amendment, nor are we at
liberty to apply the test of reasonableness with the freedom with
which the Judges of the Supreme Court of America are accustomed
to apply "the due process"
clause. There are grave doubts about the expediency of transplanting
western experience in our country. Social conditions are different and
so also the general intellectual level. Arguments which would be valid
in respect of one area of the world may not hold good in respect of
another area.
(iv) (a) This discretion in the matter of sentence is to be exercised
by the Judge judicially, after balancing all the aggravating and
mitigating circumstances of the crime.
(b) The discretion is liable to be corrected by superior courts. The
exercise of judicial discretion on well-recognised principles is, in the
final analysis, the safest possible safeguard for the accused.
In view of the above, it will be impossible to say that there would
be at all any discrimination, since crime as crime may appear to be
superficially the same but the facts and circumstances of a crime are
widely different. Thus considered, the provision in Section 302, Penal
Code is not violative of Article 14 of the Constitution on the ground
that it confers on the Judges an unguided and uncontrolled
discretion in the matter of awarding capital punishment or
imprisonment for life.
(v) (a) Relevant facts and circumstances impinging on the nature
and circumstances of the crime can be brought before the court at
the pre-conviction stage, notwithstanding the fact that no formal
procedure for producing evidence regarding such facts and
circumstances had been specifically provided. Where counsel
addresses the court with regard to the character and standing of the
accused, they are duly considered by the court unless there is
something in the evidence itself which belies him or the Public
Prosecutor challenges the facts.
(b) It is to be emphasised that in exercising its discretion to
choose either of the two alternative sentences provided in Section
302 IPC,
'the court is principally concerned with the facts and
circumstances whether aggravating or mitigating, which are
connected with the particular crime under inquiry. All such facts and
circumstances are capable of being proved in accordance with the
provisions of the Indian Evidence Act in a trial regulated by CrPC.
The trial does not come to an end until all the relevant facts are
proved and the counsel on both sides have an opportunity to address
the court. The only thing that remains is for the Judge to decide on
the guilt and punishment and that is what Sections 306(2) and 309
(2) CrPC purport to provide for. These provisions are part of the
procedure established by law and unless it is shown that they are
invalid for any other reasons they must be regarded as valid. No
reasons are offered to show that they are constitutionally invalid and
hence the death sentence imposed after trial in accordance with the
procedure established by law is not unconstitutional under Article
(emphasis in original)
75. The Court, thereafter, observed that the authority of the
propositions aforesaid had not been affected by the legislative changes
but two of the propositions, at No. (iv)(a) and (v)(b), would require
modulation in terms of the changed legislative policy delineated in
Sections 354(3) and 235(2) CrPC. Thus, while otherwise reaffirming the
view taken in Jagmohan29 the Court held and laid down as under :
"164. Attuned to the legislative policy delineated in Sections 354
(3) and 235(2), propositions (iv) (a) and (v)(b) in Jagmohan 29 shall
have to be recast and may be stated as below:
(a) The normal rule is that the offence of murder shall be
punished with the sentence of life imprisonment. The court can
depart from that rule and impose the sentence of death only if
there are special reasons for doing so. Such reasons must be
recorded in writing before imposing the death sentence.
(b) While considering the question of sentence to be imposed
for the offence of murder under Section 302 of the Penal Code,
the court must have regard to every relevant circumstance
relating to the crime as well as the criminal. If the court finds, but
not otherwise, that the offence is of an exceptionally depraved
and heinous character and constitutes, on account of its design
and the manner of its execution, a source of grave danger to the
society at large, the court may impose the death sentence.
165. The soundness or application of the other propositions in
Jagmohan ²9, and the premises on which they rest, are not affected
in any way by the legislative changes since effected. On the
contrary, these changes reinforce the reasons given in Jagmohan ²9,
for holding that the impugned provisions of the Penal Code and the
Criminal Procedure Code do not offend Articles 14 and 21 of the
Constitution. Now, Parliament has in Section 354(3) given a broad
and clear guideline which is to serve the purpose of lodestar to the
court in the exercise of its sentencing discretion. Parliament has
advisedly not restricted this sentencing discretion further, as, in its
legislative judgment, it is neither possible nor desirable to do so.
Parliament could not but be aware that since amending Act 26 of
1955, death penalty has been imposed by courts on an extremely
small percentage of persons convicted of murder - a fact which
demonstrates that courts have generally exercised their discretion in
inflicting this extreme penalty with great circumspection, caution
and restraint. Cognizant of the past experience of the administration
of death penalty in India, Parliament, in its wisdom, thought it best
and safe to leave the imposition of this gravest punishment in
gravest cases of murder, to the judicial discretion of the courts which
are manned by persons of reason, experience and standing in the
profession. The exercise of this sentencing discretion cannot be said
to be untrammelled and unguided. It is exercised judicially in
accordance with well-recognised principles crystallised by judicial
decisions, directed along the broad contours of legislative policy
towards the signposts enacted in Section 354(3).
166. The new Section 235(2) adds to the number of several other
safeguards which were embodied in the Criminal Procedure Code of
1898 and have been re-enacted in the Code of 1973. Then, the
errors in the exercise of this guided judicial discretion are liable to be
corrected by the superior courts. The procedure provided in the
Criminal Procedure Code for imposing capital punishment for murder
and some other capital crimes under the Penal Code cannot, by any
reckoning, be said to be unfair, unreasonable and unjust. Nor can it
be said that this sentencing discretion, with which the courts are
invested, amounts to delegation of its power of legislation by
Parliament. The argument to that effect is entirely misconceived. We
would, therefore, reaffirm the view taken by this Court in
Jagmohan ²9, and hold that the impugned provisions do not violate
Articles 14, 19 and 21 of the Constitution."
(emphasis supplied)
76. The Court also stated that "special reasons" in the context of
Section 354(3) CrPC would obviously mean "exceptional reasons",
meaning thereby, that the extreme penalty should be imposed only in
738, para 161)
"161.
The expression "special reasons" in the context of this
provision, obviously means "exceptional reasons" founded on the
exceptionally grave circumstances of the particular case relating to
the crime as well as the criminal. Thus, the legislative policy now
writ large and clear on the face of Section 354(3) is that on
conviction for murder and other capital offences punishable in the
alternative with death under the Penal Code, the extreme penalty
should be imposed only in extreme cases."
(emphasis supplied)
77. After taking note of various circumstances projected before it,
which could be of mitigating factors, and while observing that the scope
and concept of mitigating factors in the area of death penalty must
receive a liberal and expansive construction, the Court proceeded to
uphold the constitutional validity of Section 354(3) CrPC, with the
observations that the legislature had explicitly prioritised life
imprisonment as the normal punishment and death penalty as being of
exception, and with enunciation of rarest of rare doctrine in the
"209.
It is, therefore, imperative to voice the concern that
courts, aided by the broad illustrative guidelines indicated by us, will
discharge the onerous function with evermore scrupulous care and
humane concern, directed along the high road of legislative policy
outlined in Section 354(3) viz. that for persons convicted of murder,
life imprisonment is the
rule and death sentence an exception. A real and abiding concern for
the dignity of human life postulates resistance to taking a life through
law's instrumentality. That ought not to be done save in the rarest of
rare cases when the alternative option is unquestionably foreclosed."
(emphasis supplied)
78. In fact, Bachan Singh 10 judgment has been succinctly
summarised and its principles explained by another Constitution Bench
of this Court in Mithu V. State of Punjab35 while dealing with the
question of constitutional validity of Section 303 IPC, which provided
for death sentence as the mandatory punishment for a person who,
being under sentence of imprisonment for life, would commit murder.
In the course of declaring the said provision contained in Section 303
IPC constitutionally invalid, the Constitution Bench dealt with a large
number of arguments; and one of them had been that the validity of
death sentence had already been upheld in Bachan Singh10 and,
therefore, such questions should not be allowed to raise their head over
again. While pointing out the fallacy of this argument, the Constitution
Bench explained as to what exactly had been the ratio of Bachan
"7.
The majority did not lay down any abstract proposition in
Bachan Singh10 that "death sentence is constitutional", that is to
say, that "it is permissible under the Constitution to provide for the
sentence of death". To be exact, the question which arose for the
consideration of the Court was not whether, under the Constitution,
it is permissible to provide for the sentence of death. The precise
question which arose in that case was whether Section 302 of the
Penal Code which provides for the sentence of death as one of the
two alternative sentences is valid. It may be recalled that Section
302 provides for the sentence of death as an alternative sentence
which may be imposed. The normal sentence for murder is life
imprisonment; and if the death sentence has to be imposed, the
Court is under a legal obligation under Section 354(3) of the
Criminal Procedure Code to state the special reasons for imposing
that sentence. That explains why, in Bachan Singh10, Sarkaria J.,
who spoke for the majority, underscored the words "alternative" and
Penal Code prescribes death as an alternative punishment to which
the offender may be sentenced in cases relating to seven kinds of
offences. The majority concluded that Section 302 of the Penal Code
is valid for three main reasons : Firstly, that the death sentence
provided for by Section 302 is an alternative to the sentence of life
imprisonment, secondly, that special reasons have to be stated if the
normal rule is departed from and the death sentence has to be
imposed; and, thirdly, because the accused is entitled, under
Section 235(2) of the Code of Criminal Procedure, to be heard on the
question of sentence. The last of these three reasons becomes
relevant, only because of the first of these reasons. In other words, it
is because the court
has an option to impose either of the two alternative sentences, subject
to the rule that the normal punishment for murder is life imprisonment,
that it is important to hear the accused on the question of sentence.
The ratio of Bachan Singh10, therefore, is that, death sentence is
constitutional if it is prescribed as an alternative sentence for the
offence of murder and if the normal sentence prescribed by law for
murder is imprisonment for life."
(emphasis in original and supplied)
79. Thereafter, in Machhi Singh a three-Judge Bench of this Court,
while considering a case where the appellant was convicted of
orchestrating and executing a conspiracy, which resulted in the murder
of as many as 17 people due to a family feud, explained the philosophy
para 32)
"32.
Every member of the community owes a debt to the
community for this protection. When ingratitude is shown instead of
gratitude by "killing" a member of the community which protects the
murderer himself from being killed, or when the community feels
that for the sake of self-preservation the killer has to be killed, the
community may well withdraw the protection by sanctioning the
death penalty. But the community will not do so in every case. It
may do so "in the rarest of rare cases" when its collective conscience
is so shocked that it will expect the holders of the judicial power
centre to inflict death penalty irrespective of their personal opinion
as regards desirability or otherwise of retaining death penalty. The
community may entertain such a sentiment when the crime is
viewed from the platform of the motive for, or the manner of
commission of the crime
"
(emphasis supplied)
80. The Court also explained the relevant propositions of Bachan
Singh1 and the pertinent queries for applying those propositions in the
"38. In this background the guidelines indicated in Bachan Singh
case10 will have to be culled out and applied to the facts of each
individual case where the question of imposing of death sentence
arises. The following propositions emerge from Bachan Singh case10:
(i) The extreme penalty of death need not be inflicted except in
gravest cases of extreme culpability.
(ii) Before opting for the death penalty the circumstances of
the "offender" also require to be taken into consideration along
with the circumstances of the "crime".
(iii) Life imprisonment is the rule and death sentence is an
exception. In other words death sentence must be imposed only
when life imprisonment appears to be an altogether inadequate
punishment having regard to the relevant circumstances of the
crime, and provided, and only provided, the option to impose
sentence of imprisonment for
life cannot be conscientiously exercised having regard to the nature and
circumstances of the crime and all the relevant circumstances.
(iv) A balance sheet of aggravating and mitigating
circumstances has to be drawn up and in doing so the mitigating
circumstances have to be accorded full weightage and a just
balance has to be struck between the aggravating and the
mitigating circumstances before the option is exercised.
39. In order to apply these guidelines inter alia the following
questions may be asked and answered:
(a) Is there something uncommon about the crime which
renders sentence of imprisonment for life inadequate and calls for
a death sentence?
(b) Are the circumstances of the crime such that there is no
alternative but to impose death sentence even after according
maximum weightage to the mitigating circumstances which speak
in favour of the offender?
40. If upon taking an overall global view of all the circumstances
in the light of the aforesaid proposition and taking into account the
answers to the questions posed hereinabove, the circumstances of
the case are such that death sentence is warranted, the court would
proceed to do so."
(emphasis supplied)
81. Another relevant decision to be noticed is that in Swamy
Shraddananda (2)¹7. The said decision was rendered by a three-Judge
Bench of this Court in the backdrop that though a two-Judge Bench of
this Court upheld36 the conviction of the appellant of the offences under
Sections 302 and 201 IPC but, one of the learned Judges felt that in
the facts and circumstances of the case, punishment of imprisonment
till the end of the natural life of the convict would serve the ends of
justice, whereas the other the learned Judge was of the view that the
appellant was liable to the punishment of death. In keeping with the
ever-progressing canons of penology, the three-Judge Bench carved out
a different course, being of not awarding death penalty but, of
conditioning the sentence of imprisonment for life with a rider that the
convict shall not be released from the prison for the rest of his life.
82. The Court explained the logic of such sentencing, which
overrides the availability of remission, in the following terms : [Swamy
"92. The matter may be looked at from a slightly different angle.
The issue of sentencing has two aspects. A sentence may be
excessive and unduly harsh or it may be highly disproportionately
inadequate-. When an appellant comes to this Court carrying a death
sentence awarded by the trial court and confirmed by the High
Court, this Court may find, as in the
present appeal, that the case just falls short of the rarest of the rare
category and may feel somewhat reluctant in endorsing the death
sentence. But at the same time, having regard to the nature of the
crime, the Court may strongly feel that a sentence of life imprisonment
subject to remission normally works out to a term of 14 years would be
grossly disproportionate and inadequate. What then should the Court
do? If the Court's option is limited only to two punishments, one a
sentence of imprisonment, for all intents and purposes, of not more
than 14 years and the other death, the Court may feel tempted and
find itself nudged into endorsing the death penalty. Such a course
would indeed be disastrous. A far more just, reasonable and proper
course would be to expand the options and to take over what, as a
matter of fact, lawfully belongs to the Court i.e. the vast hiatus
between 14 years' imprisonment and death. It needs to be emphasised
that the Court would take recourse to the expanded option primarily
because in the facts of the case, the sentence of 14 years'
The surest way't to legal research!"
imprisonment would amount to no punishment at all.
93. Further, the formalisation of a special category of sentence,
though for an extremely few number of cases, shall have the great
advantage of having the death penalty on the statute book but to
actually use it as little as possible, really in the rarest of rare cases.
This would only be a reassertion of the Constitution Bench decision
in Bachan Singh10 besides being in accord with the modern trends in
penology."
(emphasis supplied)
83. We need not elongate this discussion by assembling various
other decisions rendered in variegated circumstances and factual
matrices but deem it appropriate to refer to the decision in Shankar
Kisanrao Khade V. State of Maharashtra³7, wherein this Court surveyed
a large number of cases on either side, that is, where death sentence
was upheld/awarded or where it was commuted; and pointed out the
requirement of applying "crime test", "criminal test" and "rarest of rare
test". This Court recounted, with reference to previous decisions, the
aggravating circumstances (crime test) and the mitigating
"49. In Bachan Singh10 and Machhi Singh11, this Court laid down
various principles for awarding sentence : (Rajendra Pralhadrao
38
33.
Aggravating circumstances - (Crime test)
(1) The offences relating to the commission of heinous crimes like
murder, rape, armed dacoity, kidnapping, etc. by the accused with a
prior record of conviction for capital felony or offences committed by
the person having a substantial history of serious assaults and
criminal convictions.
(2) The offence was committed while the offender was engaged in
the commission of another serious offence.
(3) The offence was committed with the intention to create a fear
psychosis in the public at large and was committed in a public place
by a weapon or device which clearly could be hazardous to the life of
more than one person.
(4) The offence of murder was committed for ransom or like
offences to receive money or monetary benefits.
(5) Hired killings.
(6) The offence was committed outrageously for want only while
involving inhumane treatment and torture to the victim.
(7) The offence was committed by a person while in lawful
custody.
(8) The murder or the offence was committed to prevent a person
lawfully carrying out his duty like arrest or custody in a place of
lawful confinement of himself or another. For instance, murder is of a
person who had acted in lawful discharge of his duty under Section
43 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.
(9) When the crime is enormous in proportion like making an
attempt of murder of the entire family or members of a particular
community.
(10) When the victim is innocent, helpless or a person relies upon
the trust of relationship and social norms, like a child, helpless
woman, a daughter or a niece staying with a father/uncle and is
inflicted with the crime by such a trusted person.
(11) When murder is committed for a motive which evidences
total depravity and meanness.
(12) When there is a cold-blooded murder without provocation.
(13) The crime is committed so brutally that it pricks or shocks
not only the judicial conscience but even the conscience of the
society.
Mitigating circumstances - (Criminal test)
(1) The manner and circumstances in and under which the offence
was committed, for example, extreme mental or emotional
disturbance or extreme provocation in contradistinction to all these
situations in normal course.
(2) The age of the accused is a relevant consideration but not a
determinative factor by itself.
(3) The chances of the accused of not indulging in commission of
the crime again and the probability of the accused being reformed
and rehabilitated.
(4) The condition of the accused shows that he was mentally
defective and the defect impaired his capacity to appreciate the
circumstances of his criminal conduct.
(5) The circumstances which, in normal course of life, would
render such a behaviour possible and could have the effect of giving
rise to mental imbalance in that given situation like persistent
harassment or, in fact, leading to such a peak of human behaviour
that, in the facts
and circumstances of the case, the accused believed that he was
morally justified in committing the offence.
(6) Where the court upon proper appreciation of evidence is of the
view that the crime was not committed in a preordained manner and
that the death resulted in the course of commission of another crime
and that there was a possibility of it being construed as
consequences to the commission of the primary crime.
(7) Where it is absolutely unsafe to rely upon the testimony of a
sole eyewitness though the prosecution has brought home the guilt
of the accused.
576, para 52)
"52. Aggravating circumstances as pointed out above, of course,
are not exhaustive so also the mitigating circumstances. In my
considered view, the tests that we have to apply, while awarding
death sentence are "crime test", "criminal test" and the "R-R test"
and not the "balancing test". To award death sentence, the "crime
test" has to be fully satisfied, that is, 100% and "criminal test" 0%,
that is, no mitigating circumstance favouring the accused. If there is
any circumstance favouring the accused, like lack of intention to
commit the crime, possibility of reformation, young age of the
accused, not a menace to the society, no previous track record, etc.
the "criminal test" may favour the accused to avoid the capital
punishment. Even if both the tests are satisfied, that is, the
aggravating circumstances to the fullest extent and no mitigating
circumstances favouring the accused, still we have to apply finally
the rarest of the rare case test (R-R test). R-R test depends upon the
perception of the society that is "society-centric" and not "Judge-
centric", that is, whether the society will approve the awarding of
death sentence to certain types of crimes or not. While applying that
test, the court has to look into variety of factors like society's
abhorrence, extreme indignation and antipathy to certain types
of crimes like sexual assault and murder of intellectually
challenged minor girls, suffering from physical disability, old
and infirm women with those disabilities, etc. Examples are only
illustrative and not exhaustive. The courts award death sentence
since situation demands so, due to constitutional compulsion,
reflected by the will of the people and not the will of the Judges."
(emphasis and extra emphasis supplied)
85. It is also noteworthy that the said proposition of special category
of sentencing by way of life imprisonment sans remission was again a
matter of debate and led to a reference to the Constitution Bench,
which came to be answered in Union of India V. V. Sriharan39 39 There
had been several questions referred to the Constitution Bench as
regards the powers of remission, but all those aspects need not be
dilated herein. The aspect relevant for the present purpose is that a
majority of three Judges approved the ratio in
Swamy Shraddananda (2) 17 providing for special category of life
sentence without remission. Though the minority opinion concurred
that imprisonment for life in terms of Section 52 read with Section 45
IPC only meant imprisonment for the rest of the life of the convict,
where the right to claim remission, commutation, etc. as provided
under Article 72 or 161 of the Constitution of India would always be
available but, did not concur with other part of the majority opinion
approving the aforesaid special category sentence with the reasoning
that such a course of providing mandatory period of actual
imprisonment would be inconsistent with Section 433-A CrPC.
86. The majority view, being the declaration of law by this Court,
could be usefully noticed from the relevant question and its answer as
"Question 52.1 : Whether imprisonment for life in terms of Section 53 read with
Section 45 of the Penal Code meant imprisonment for rest of the life of the
prisoner or a convict undergoing life imprisonment has a right to claim remission
and whether as per the principles enunciated in paras 91 to 93 of Swamy
Shraddananda (2)17, a special category of sentence may be made for the very
few cases where the death penalty might be substituted by the punishment of
imprisonment for life or imprisonment for a term in excess of fourteen years and
to put that category beyond application of remission?
Answer
177. Imprisonment for life in terms of Section 53 read with
Section 45 of the Penal Code only means imprisonment for the rest
of the life of the convict. The right to claim remission, commutation,
reprieve, etc. as provided under Article 72 or Article 161 of the
Constitution will always be available being constitutional remedies
untouchable by the Court.
178. We hold that the ratio laid down in Swamy Shraddananda
(2)17 that a special category of sentence; instead of death can be
substituted by the punishment of imprisonment for life or for a term
exceeding 14 years and put that category beyond application of
remission is well founded and we answer the said question in the
affirmative."
87. Before proceeding further, we may observe that with
development of the law on sentencing procedure in accord with the
decisions aforesaid, one of the elements of mitigating factors, namely,
probability of reformation of the convict and his rehabilitation and
reintegration into the mainstream society, has been given due
consideration, rather extra weightage, as highlighted by various
decisions of this Court. As an example, we may refer to the decision in
Rajendra Pralhadrao Wasnik V. State of Maharashtra40, wherein the
appellant was convicted of the offences under Section 376(2)(f), 377
and 302 IPC for rape and murder of a three-year-old girl on the basis of
circumstantial evidence and was sentenced to death. Though his appeal
to this Court was dismissed 38
and review petition was also dismissed4 41 but, his review petition was
later on reopened42 and heard by a three-Judge Bench. This Court
held40 that there was no hard-and-fast rule that death sentence could
not be awarded if conviction was based on circumstantial evidence, but
proceeded to commute death sentence into that of life imprisonment
after finding that the trial court and the High Court43 did not consider
various factors including the probability of the petitioner to be
reformed.
88. This Court, inter alia, held as under : (Rajendra Pralhadrao
"45. The law laid down by various decisions of this Court clearly
and unequivocally mandates that the probability (not possibility or
improbability or impossibility) that a convict can be reformed and
rehabilitated in society must be seriously and earnestly considered
by the courts before awarding the death sentence. This is one of the
mandates of the "special reasons" requirement of Section 354(3)
CrPC and ought not to be taken lightly since it involves snuffing out
the life of a person. To effectuate this mandate, it is the obligation
on the prosecution to prove to the court, through evidence, that the
probability is that the convict cannot be reformed or rehabilitated.
This can be achieved by bringing on record, inter alia, material about
his conduct in jail, his conduct outside jail if he has been on bail for
some time, medical evidence about his mental make-up, contact
with his family and so on. Similarly, the convict can produce
evidence on these issues as well.
*
*
*
47. Consideration of the reformation, rehabilitation and
reintegration of the convict into society cannot be overemphasised.
Until Bachan Singh10, the emphasis given by the courts was
primarily on the nature of the crime, its brutality and severity.
Bachan Singh10 placed the sentencing process into perspective and
introduced the necessity of considering the reformation or
rehabilitation of the convict. Despite the view expressed by the
Constitution Bench, there have been several instances, where
there is a tendency to give primacy to the crime and consider the
criminal in a somewhat secondary manner. As observed in
Sangeet4 "In the sentencing process, both the crime and the
criminal are equally important." Therefore, we should not forget that
the criminal, however ruthless he might be, is nevertheless a human
being and is entitled to a life of dignity notwithstanding his crime.
Therefore, it is for the prosecution and the courts to determine
whether such a person, notwithstanding his crime,
can be reformed and rehabilitated. To obtain and analyse this
information is certainly not an easy task but must nevertheless be
undertaken. The process of rehabilitation is also not a simple one since
it involves social reintegration of the convict into society. Of course,
notwithstanding any information made available and its analysis by
experts coupled with the evidence on record, there could be instances
where the social reintegration of the convict may not be possible. If
that should happen, the option of a long duration of imprisonment is
permissible."
89. The learned counsel for the appellant has cited a few decisions
with the submissions that in these cases, the death sentence was
altered to other sentence by this Court while applying the principle of
"residual doubt". Though it is noticed that the cited decisions did not as
such proceed on the theory of "residual doubt" but, we may take note
of the relevant features of the cited decisions. It may, however, be
observed that the contentions relating to the theory of "residual doubt"
shall be adverted to a little later.
90. In Viran Gyanlal Rajput6 the accused was convicted of the
offences under Sections 302, 201 IPC and Sections 10 and 14 Pocso,
for kidnapping, rape and murder of a 13-year-old girl and causing
disappearance of evidence, and he was awarded death sentence for the
offence under Section 302 IPC. The case was based on circumstantial
evidence, with the incriminating circumstances operating against the
appellant being that he was last seen with the deceased while she was
walking home from school; he was later seen running alone in the
evening; the dead body and the incriminating articles like clothes of the
victim were recovered at his instance; mud stains on his pants matched
the mud stains seized from the spot; his failure to explain the injuries
found on his person; medical evidence showing that the victim had
been forcibly raped and killed; hiding the dead body to suppress
evidence; and failure of the appellant to offer a plausible explanation
for the incriminating circumstances against him. While confirming the
conviction of the appellant under other provisions as also the death
sentence, the High Court set aside45 the conviction of the appellant
under Section 10 Pocso. As regards death sentence, this Court
reiterated the principle that life imprisonment was the rule and death
sentence was the exception, which was to be imposed only when the
alternative of life imprisonment had been unquestionably foreclosed.
This Court found that even though the crime committed by the
appellant was abominable, it could not be held to be falling within the
"rarest of rare". This Court also found that the prosecution had been
unable to prove that the appellant could not be reformed and thus,
commuted the sentence of death into that of imprisonment for life
without scope of remission for 20 years.
91. These findings of this Court could be usefully reproduced as
"25. Though we agree that the crime committed is of an
abominable nature, it cannot be said to be of such a brutal,
depraved, heinous or diabolical nature so as to fall into the category
of the rarest of rare cases and
invite punishment with death. We also find ourselves unable to agree
with the view of the courts that the appellant is such a menace to
society that he cannot be allowed to stay alive. On the other hand, we
are of the view that the prosecution did not establish that the appellant
was beyond reform, especially given his young age. We are also mindful
of the appellant's lack of criminal antecedents prior to the commission
of this crime, and of his post-incarceration conduct, which in no way
suggests the impossibility of his reform. It would be pertinent to
observe at this point that although the trial court noted his lack of
remorse during the hearing, and the High Court noted his lack of
remorse after committing the crime, as he was found calmly wandering
around the locality, this does not in any way indicate that there is no
scope of reform for the appellant.
26. Thus, neither the circumstances of the crime nor the
circumstances of the criminal i.e. the appellant, would go to show
that the instant matter falls into the category of the rarest of rare
cases, or that the sentence of life imprisonment is unquestionably
foreclosed and grossly disproportionate. Therefore, in the totality of
the facts and circumstances of this case, we find it fit to commute
the death sentence of the appellant to life imprisonment.
27. At the same time, we are of the opinion that a sentence of life
imprisonment simpliciter would not be proportionate to the gravity of
the offence committed, and would not meet the need to respond to
crimes against women and children in the most stringent manner
possible. Moreover, though we have noticed above that the
possibility of reform of the accused is not completely precluded, we
nevertheless share the concerns of the trial court and the High Court
regarding the lack of remorse on behalf of the appellant and the
possibility of reoffending. In such a situation, we deem it fit to
restrict the right of the appellant to claim remission in his sentence
of life imprisonment for a period of 20 years."
92. In Babasaheb Maruti Kamble4 the appellant was convicted of
the offences under Sections 302, 376(2)(f) and 342 IPC and was
awarded death sentence for the offence punishable under Section 302
IPC. The said case also rested on circumstantial evidence which
included the circumstances that the deceased girl was last seen with
the appellant; the dead body of the victim girl was found in his house
and under his bed; and slippers and clothes of the victim girl were also
recovered from his house along with bloodstained chadar; DNA and
post-mortem examination report corroborated the prosecution case.
Having found the conviction not calling for any interference, this Court
took into account the factors that the appellant had reached the age of
60 years, had no criminal antecedents, there was likelihood of reform
and the respondent State could not point out any blameworthy conduct
by him in jail. Thus, this Court commuted the death sentence into that
of life with a cap of 20 years' imprisonment without remission.
93. In Nand Kishore8, the appellant-accused, about 50 years of age,
was convicted of the offences under Sections 302, 363, 366 and 376(2)
(i) IPC for kidnapping, rape and murder of an 8-year-old girl. The case
was based on
circumstantial evidence where PW 4, brother of the deceased girl,
identified the appellant in test identification parade and categorically
stated that the appellant took away the deceased from mela. The last
seen evidence was corroborated by PW 7. This Court upheld the
conviction. As regards the question of sentence, where the appellant
had been sentenced to death, this Court referred, inter alia, to the
enunciation in Swamy Shraddananda (2)17 and observed that the
appellant was having no criminal antecedents and was coming from a
poor socio-economic background, where the local Bar Association
refused to represent the appellant and he was provided legal aid only
on the day of framing of charge. This Court also found that there was
no finding recorded by the courts below that the appellant could not be
reformed.
94. In the overall circumstances, this Court commuted death
sentence into life imprisonment with actual period of 25 years without
285, paras 15-16)
"15.
So far as the present case is concerned, it solely rests on
circumstantial evidence. It is the specific case of the appellant that
he was denied the proper legal assistance in the matter and he is a
manhole worker. The appellant was aged about 50 years. Further, in
this case there is no finding recorded by the courts below to the
effect that there is no possibility of reformation of the appellant. We
are of the view that the reasons assigned by the trial court
as
confirmed by the High Court, do not constitute special reasons within
the meaning of Section 354(3) CrPC to impose death penalty on the
accused.
16. Taking into account the evidence on record and the totality of
the circumstances of the case, and by applying the test on the
touchstone of case law discussed above, we are of the view that the
case on hand will not fall within the "rarest of rare" cases. In that
view of the matter, we are of the view that the death sentence
imposed by the trial court, as confirmed by the High Court, requires
modification. Accordingly, this appeal is allowed in part; while
confirming the conviction, recorded by the trial court, as confirmed
by the appellate court, we modify the sentence to that of life
imprisonment with actual period of 25 vears. without anv benefit of
remission. It is further made clear that sentences imposed for all
offences shall run concurrently."
95. The decision in Sakru Mahagu Binjewar does not have any
factual correlation with the case at hand except that therein, this Court
referred to the principles in Bachan Singh10 and Machhi Singh11 while
pointing out that the same have been consistently followed by the
courts depending on the facts and circumstances of each case as also
that this Court has referred to the principles evolved in Swamy
Shraddananda (2)¹7, as approved by the
Constitution Bench in V. Sriharan³9. In Sakru Mahagu Binjewar case9,
the High Court46 , while upholding conviction under Section 302 IPC
based on the evidence of eyewitnesses, commuted the death sentence
awarded to some of the accused persons, inter alia, for the reasons that
the accused felt they were falsely implicated in a criminal case; and
that there was no evidence to suggest that the accused had a criminal
record. In the given set of facts and circumstances, this Court in Sakru
Mahagu Binjewar case 9, found no ground to interfere with the
judgments under appeal.
96. Yet further, a few other decisions, relied upon by the learned
counsel for the respondent State in support of his arguments could also
be noticed as follows:
96.1. Kamta Tiwari14 was a case of rape followed by murder of a 7-
year-old girl by a person who was close to the family of the victim and
the victim used to call him "Tiwari uncle". The girl was kidnapped by
the accused; was subjected to rape; was strangulated to death; and
then, the dead body was thrown into the well. The enormity of crime
coupled with the misuse of trust weighed with this Court in confirming
the death sentence.
96.2. In Santosh Kumar Satishbhushan Bariyar12, this Court
extensively dealt with three broad values emerging from Bachan
Singh10, that is, individualised sentencing, threshold of rarest of rare,
and principled sentencing and said, inter alia, as under : (Santosh
"131. When the court is faced with a capital sentencing case, a
comparative analysis of the case before it with other purportedly
similar cases would be in the fitness of the scheme of the
Constitution. Comparison will presuppose an identification of a pool
of equivalently circumstanced capital defendants. The gravity, nature
and motive relating to crime will play a role in this analysis.
132. Next step would be to deal with the subjectivity involved
in
capital cases. The imprecision of the identification of aggravating and
mitigating circumstances has to be minimised. It is to be noted that
the mandate of equality clause applies to the sentencing process
rather than the outcome. The comparative review must be
undertaken not to channel the sentencing discretion available to the
courts but to bring in consistency in identification of various relevant
circumstances. The aggravating and mitigating circumstances have
to be separately identified under a rigorous measure.
133. Bachan Singh10 when mandates principled precedent-based
sentencing, compels careful scrutiny of mitigating circumstances and
aggravating circumstances and then factoring in a process by which
aggravating and mitigating circumstances appearing from the pool of
comparable cases can be compared. The weight which is accorded by
the court to particular aggravating and mitigating circumstances may
vary from case to case in the name of individualised sentencing, but at
the same time reasons for apportionment of weights shall be
forthcoming. Such a comparison may point out excessiveness as also
will help repel arbitrariness objections in future. A sentencing hearing,
comparative review of cases and similarly aggravating and mitigating
circumstances analysis can only be given a go-by if the sentencing
court opts for life imprisonment."
96.3. In Vasanta Sampat Dupare 15, 16 where this Court dealt with
the main appeals and thereafter, the review petitions and confirmed the
death sentence for the offence under Section 302 IPC, the accused had
taken the victim girl on his bicycle when she was playing in the
courtyard and was found to have raped and murdered her. The facts of
the said case had been strikingly similar to the facts of the present
case, where it was found that the accused raped the four-year-old
victim girl, and battered and smashed her head by stones and killed
her.
96.4. In the main judgment dealing with the appeals in Vasanta
Sampat Dupare15 this Court examined all the circumstances, including
the misuse of trust reposed by the girl in the accused; the factual
matrix unfolding the premeditation, the proclivity and the rapacious
desire; the crime speaking of depravity and degradation; the crime
being diabolical and barbaric; and less likelihood of
reformation/rehabilitation of the convict.
96.5. Thus, this Court upheld the sentence of death while observing
& 60-63)
"58. Presently, we shall proceed to dwell upon the manner in
which the crime was committed. Materials on record clearly reveal
that the appellant was well acquainted with the inhabitants of the
locality and as is demonstrable he had access to the house of the
father of the deceased and the children used to call him "uncle". He
had lured the deceased to go with him to have chocolates. It is an
act of taking advantage of absolute innocence. He had taken the
deceased from place to place by his bicycle and eventually raped her
in a brutal manner, as if he had an insatiable and ravenous appetite.
The injuries caused on the minor girl are likely to send a chill in the
spine of the society and shiver in the marrows of human conscience.
He had battered her to death by assaulting her with two heavy
stones. The injured minor girl could not have shown any kind of
resistance. It is not a case where the accused had a momentary
lapse. It is also not a case where the minor child had died because of
profuse bleeding due to rape but because of the deliberate cruel
assault by the appellant. After the savage act was over, the coolness
of the appellant is evident, for he washed the clothes on the tap and
took proper care to hide things. As is manifest, he even did not think
for a moment the trauma and torture that was caused to the
deceased. The gullibility and vulnerability of the four-year-old girl,
who
could not have nurtured any idea about the maladroitly designed
biological desires of this nature, went with the uncle who extinguished
her life-spark. The barbaric act of the appellant does not remotely show
any concern for the precious life of a young minor child who had really
not seen life. The criminality of the conduct of the appellant is not only
depraved and debased, but can have a menacing effect on the society.
It is calamitous.
*
*
*
60. In the case at hand, as we find, not only was the rape
committed in a brutal manner but murder was also committed in a
barbaric manner. The rape of a minor girl child is nothing but a
monstrous burial of her dignity in the darkness. It is a crime against
the holy body of a girl child and the soul of society and such a crime
is aggravated by the manner in which it has been committed. The
nature of the crime and the manner in which it has been committed
speaks about its uncommonness. The crime speaks of depravity,
degradation and uncommonality. It is diabolical and barbaric. The
crime was committed in an inhuman manner. Indubitably, these go
a long way to establish the aggravating circumstances.
61. We are absolutely conscious that mitigating circumstances are
to be taken into consideration. The learned counsel for the appellant
pointing out the mitigating circumstances would submit that the
appellant is in his mid-fifties and there is possibility of his
reformation. Be it noted, the appellant was aged about forty-seven
years at the time of commission of the crime. As is noticeable, there
has been no remorse on the part of the appellant. There are cases
when this Court has commuted the death sentence to life finding
that the accused has expressed remorse or the crime was not
premeditated. But the obtaining factual matrix when unfolded stage
by stage would show the premeditation, the proclivity and the
rapacious desire. The learned counsel would submit that the
appellant had no criminal antecedents but we find that he was a
history-sheeter and had a number of cases pending against him.
That alone may not be sufficient. The appalling cruelty shown by him
to the minor girl child is extremely shocking and it gets accentuated,
when his age is taken into consideration. It was not committed
under any mental stress or emotional disturbance and it is difficult to
comprehend that he would not commit such acts and would be
reformed or rehabilitated. As the circumstances would graphically
depict, he would remain a menace to society, for a defenceless child
has become his prey. In our considered opinion, there are no
mitigating circumstances.
62. As we perceive, this case deserves to fall in the category of
the rarest of rare cases. It is inconceivable from the perspective of
the society that a married man aged about two scores and seven
makes a four-year minor innocent girl child the prey of his lust and
deliberately causes her death. A helpless and defenceless child gets
raped and murdered because of the acquaintance of the appellant
with the people of the society. This is not only betrayal of an
individual trust but destruction and devastation of social trust. It is
perversity in its enormity. It irrefragably invites the extreme
abhorrence and indignation of the collective. It is an anathema to
the social balance. In our view, it meets the test of the rarest of the
rare case and we unhesitatingly so hold.
Consequently, we dismiss the criminal appeals preferred by
the appellant and affirm the death sentence."
96.6. In the review petitions, several other mitigating circumstances
were projected before the Court including the qualifications acquired by
the accused during the pendency of the matter and the probability of
his reformation. This Court found that the aggravating circumstances
i.e. extreme depravity and barbaric manner of the crime outweighed
the mitigating circumstances. Hence, while dismissing the review
petitions, this Court observed and concluded as under47 : (Vasanta
"21. The material placed on record shows that after the
judgment1 under review, the petitioner has completed Bachelors
Preparatory Programme offered by Indira Gandhi National Open
University enabling him to prepare for Bachelor level study and that
he has also completed the Gandhi Vichar Pariksha and had
participated in drawing competition organised sometime in January
2016. It is asserted that the jail record of the petitioner is without
any blemish. The matter is not contested as regards Conditions (1),
(2), (5), (6) and (7) as stated in para 206 of the decision in Bachan
Singh10, but what is now being projected is that there is a possibility
of the accused being reformed and rehabilitated. Though these
attempts on the part of the petitioner are after the judgment 15 under
review, we have considered the material in that behalf to see if those
circumstances warrant a different view. We have given anxious
consideration to the material on record but find that the aggravating
circumstances, namely, the extreme depravity and the barbaric
manner in which the crime was committed and the fact that the
victim was a helpless girl of four years clearly outweigh the
mitigating circumstances now brought on record. Having taken an
overall view of the matter, in our considered view, no case is made
out to take a different view in the matter. We, therefore, affirm the
view taken in the judgment1 15 under review and dismiss the present
review petitions."
97. In Pappu19, after taking note of various decisions on the subject,
we had summarised the principles evolved and norms followed by the
courts in the matters involving capital punishment; and would iterate
"144. It could readily be seen that while this Court has found it
justified to have capital punishment on the statute to serve as
deterrent as also in due response to the society's call for appropriate
punishment in appropriate cases but at the same time, the principles
of penology have evolved to balance the other obligations of the
society i.e. of preserving the human life, be it of accused, unless
termination thereof is inevitable and is to serve
the other societal causes and collective conscience of society. This has
led to the evolution of "rarest of rare test" and then, its appropriate
operation with reference to "crime test" and "criminal test". The
delicate balance expected of the judicial process has also led to another
midway approach, in curtailing the rights of remission or premature
release while awarding imprisonment for life, particularly when dealing
with crimes of heinous nature like the present one."
J.2. The theory of residual doubt
98. As regards the theory of "residual doubt", which has been
heavily relied upon by the learned Senior Counsel for the appellant, we
may usefully reiterate that nothing of any so-called "residual doubt"
theory was referred to or applied in the cases cited by the learned
counsel. Rather, in Sakru Mahagu Binjewar2, the proposition for
extending benefit of doubt was rejected by this Court with reference to
the overwhelming and unimpeachable evidence on record. Be that as it
may, we may profitably refer to the relevant decisions to point out the
approach of this Court towards this theory as also the fact that the
propositions about inapplicability of this theory have been clearly stated
in the later decisions, as discussed infra.
99. In Ravishankar V. State of M.P. 48 , a three-Judge Bench of this
Court re-affirmed the conviction of the appellant of the offences of
kidnapping, rape, and resultant death of a 13-year-old girl and
destruction of evidence. The case had been that of circumstantial
evidence and on the question of sentence, this Court examined as to
whether death sentence was justified. Though this Court made it clear
that even in the case where conviction is based on circumstantial
evidence, capital punishment could be awarded but then, proceeded to
observe that this Court had been increasingly applying the theory of
"residual doubt", which effectively creates a higher standard of proof
over and above the "beyond reasonable doubt" standard used at the
stage of conviction, as a safeguard against routine capital sentencing,
keeping in mind the irreversibility of death. Applying this theory and
indicating certain "residual doubts", it was held that the said case fell
short of "rarest of rare" category; and the death sentence was
commuted into one of life for the remainder of the natural life of the
convict.
100. However, in Shatrughna Baban Meshram V. State of
Maharashtra¹3 another three-Judge Bench of this Court considered an
appeal against conviction and award of death sentence for rape and
murder of a 21/2-year-old girl by her maternal uncle. On the question of
sentencing, 67 cases decided by the Supreme Court over the past 40
years were noticed; and it was observed that when the offences were of
Sections 376 and 302 IPC, and the age of the victim was under 16
years, death sentence was confirmed in 15, but in 3 of them, the
sentence was later on commuted to life in review. Hence, in only 12 out
of the 67 cases the death sentence was confirmed. As regards the
guiding factors, it was held that death penalty was not entirely
impermissible to be awarded in
circumstantial evidence cases but the circumstantial evidence ought to
be of unimpeachable character with option of lesser sentence
foreclosed.
101. The Court also examined the theory of "residual doubt" and,
after a survey of the decisions of this Court and those of the US
Supreme Court, opined against the applicability of this theory in the
& 716, paras 75 & 77)
"75.4. These features are only illustrative to say that the theory of
"residual doubt" that got developed was a result of peculiarity in the
process adopted. Even then, what is material to note is that the
theory has consistently been rejected by the US Supreme Court and
as stated49 by O'Connor, J. :"Nothing in our cases mandated the
imposition of this heightened burden of proof at capital sentencing."
*
*
*
77. When it comes to cases based on circumstantial evidence in
our jurisprudence, the standard that is adopted in terms of law laid
down by this Court as noticed in Sharad Birdhichand Sarda4 23 and
subsequent decisions is that the circumstances must not only be
individually proved or established, but they must form a consistent
chain, so conclusive as to rule out the possibility of any other
hypothesis except the guilt of the accused. On the strength of these
principles, the burden in such cases is already of a greater
magnitude. Once that burden is discharged, it is implicit that any
other hypothesis or the innocence of the accused, already stands
ruled out when the matter is taken up at the stage of sentence after
returning the finding of guilt. So, theoretically the concept or theory
of "residual doubt" does not have any place in a case based on
circumstantial evidence. As a matter of fact, the theory of residual
doubt was never accepted by the US Supreme Court as discussed
earlier."
(emphasis in original and supplied)
102. This Court in Shatrughna Baban Meshram case 13 also referred
to some of the decisions of this Court where the said theory of "residual
doubt" was referred to, including that in Ashok Debbarma V. State of
Tripura50 , and it was pointed out that those "matters were considered
from the standpoint of individual fact situation where, going by the
higher or stricter standard for imposition of death penalty, alternative
to death sentence was found to be appropriate". 51
103. We may also observe that the theory of "residual doubt" was
previously suggested before us in Pappu* 19 but, in that case, it was not
considered necessary to dilate much on this aspect because a strong
case for commuting death sentence into that of imprisonment for life
was nevertheless
made out with the mitigating factors of probability of reformation and
rehabilitation of the convict and his satisfactory jail conduct. However,
we had indicated, with reference to the aforesaid decision in
150)
"150. Having said so, we may observe that so far as the other
arguments on behalf of the appellant, with reference to the theory of
"residual doubt", are concerned, in the later three-Judge Bench
decision of this Court in Shatrughna Baban Meshram ¹3, it was
observed that the said theory, developed as a result of peculiarity in
the process adopted in US jurisdictions, has not found favour even
by the US Supreme Court. We need not dilate on this aspect any
further in the present case for the simple reason that the strong
mitigating factor of probability of reformation and rehabilitation,
particularly with reference to the antecedents and background of the
appellant coupled with his satisfactory jail conduct, make out a case
for communing death sentence into that of imprisonment for life."
104. For what has been discussed hereinabove and to put the record
straight, we deem it appropriate to observe that in the case based on
circumstantial evidence, the conclusion of guilt is recorded only after
the circumstances are found to be forming an unbreakable chain, so
consistent as to rule out any other hypothesis except the guilt of the
accused. These being stringent norms, as followed consistently by the
courts based on the panchsheel principles expounded in Sharad
Birdhichand Sarda²3, and requirement being of the proof of the case
beyond reasonable doubt, theoretically there is no scope for any
"residual doubt" operating even in the cases of circumstantial evidence.
The cases in which theory of residual doubt has at all been referred,
had been standing on their own facts, where alternative to death
sentence was considered appropriate. However, while taking up the
matter for sentencing, it is not expected to reopen the chain of
circumstantial evidence to find any weak link which may fall in the
category of residual doubt. Needless to reiterate that if at all any such
doubt is reasonably existing, the very basis of conviction would be in
question. To put it in other words, after the final conclusion on the guilt
and after pronouncing conviction, no concept of residual doubt as such
is available for the purpose of sentencing.
105. However, even when we find no reason to proceed on the
theory of residual doubt, the question of sentence in the present case
has to be determined in accordance with sentencing principles
enunciated by the Constitution Bench in Bachan Singh10 and the
principles/norms further evolved by this Court in the other decisions, as
noticed hereinbefore with the requirements of close analysis of "crime
test", "criminal test" and "rarest of rare test".
J.3. The crime and criminal tests : Aggravating and mitigating
circumstances of the present case
106. Keeping the aforesaid principles in view, we need to examine
the material facts as also all the relevant factors and circumstances for
determining the question as to whether the capital punishment
awarded to the appellant be maintained or be substituted by any other
punishment?
107. Before examining the material facts and the relevant
circumstances, we may observe that so far the trial court is concerned,
it had scrupulously carried out its duty in terms of Section 235(2) CrPC.
The judgment of conviction was pronounced on 28-9-2013 and the
question of sentence was taken up 3 clear days later i.e. on 1-10-2013;
and the death sentence was awarded only after duly hearing the
appellant-accused, after duly taking into consideration the aggravating
and mitigating factors, and while duly recording special reasons.
108. The heinous nature of the crime, like that of the present one, in
brutal rape and killing of a mentally and physically challenged girl, who
was only about seven-and-a-half-year-old, definitely carries excessively
aggravating circumstances, particularly when the manner of
commission of both the major offences of rape and murder shows
depravity of highest order and would ex facie shock anyone's
conscience. The horrific manner of killing the victim, by causing ghastly
head injuries had been nothing less than beastly conduct of the
appellant. However, as noticed, gruesome nature of the action and the
crime, by itself, may not be decisive, particularly as regards the
question of capital punishment. Thus, we need to cautiously examine
the other relevant factors, particularly those of the tests pertaining to
the criminal himself.
109. Undoubtedly, the appellant was 28 years of age at the time of
commission of crime and was having family comprising of his wife, an
eight-year-old daughter and parents. He is not shown to be coming
from any affluent background but, at the same time, it is also not
shown if he comes from a very poor socio-economic background. Taken
as a whole, these factors of the age, family and socio-economic
background of the appellant are not so clinching as to overwhelm and
override the aggravating factors.
110. Then, the pertinent question is as to whether there exists a
reasonable probability of reformation and rehabilitation of the
appellant? If the answer to this material question is in the affirmative,
it may have bearing upon the test to find if the case falls in rarest of
rare category. But, if there are factors which operate against affirmative
answer to this question on the probability of reformation and
rehabilitation, the aggravating circumstances would assuredly outweigh
the mitigating circumstances warranting capital punishment.
111. In regard to the above, the facts emerging from record are as
follows:
111.1. It is noticed that before the trial court, a suggestion was
made while pleading leniency for the appellant, that it was his first
offence. This suggestion, however, does not appear to be correct. It is
noticeable from the contents of the charge-sheet that in the process of
residence verification, it was found that the appellant was hailing from
Village Basantpur, Police Station Gugli,
District Maharajganj, Uttar Pradesh; and it came to light that he had
had a history of criminal cases inasmuch as, he was charge-sheeted in
Case No. 69 of 2011 of Police Station Shambhupura, District
Chittorgarh for the offence under Section 3 of the Prevention of Damage
to Public Property Act, 1984 and Section 307 IPC. He was also involved
in Police Station Kankroli52 Cases Nos. 78 of 2012 and 79 of 2012 for
the offence under Section 379 IPC; and in Police Station Rajnagar Case
No. 428 of 2012 for the offence under Section 379 IPC.
111.2. There is another crucial fact having direct co-relation and
connection with the present case itself, which emanates from the
statement of PW 23 Ramdev Regar, Sub-Inspector, Police Line,
Rajsamand. He testified to the fact that on 14-1-2013, a written report
about the theft of Hero Honda Passion Plus motorcycle bearing
Registration No. RJ30 3M 5944 was filed at Police Station Nathdwara,
whereupon, FIR bearing No. 39 of 2013 was registered for offence
under Section 379 IPC against unknown person. Significantly, the said
motorcycle bearing Registration No. RJ30 3M 5944 was the same one
which was used by the appellant in the present crime. This motorcycle
was recovered near the scene of crime at the information of the
appellant; and bloodstains were also collected therefrom; and DNA
profile of those bloodstains matched the DNA profile of the blood
samples of the victim girl.
112. Thus, the facts surfacing on record make it clear that the crime
in question was not the singular criminal activity of the appellant. The
antecedents of the appellant depict a person whose conduct had not
been free from blemish and, in any case, he committed the crimes of
kidnapping as also murder of the victim girl with the use of a vehicle
which did not belong to him but was a stolen one53. In other words, the
past of the appellant before the present case had been of involvement
in criminal cases; and abhorrent crimes of the present case were
committed by him with the aid of a stolen vehicle. These facts and
factors magnify the aggravating circumstances manifold.
113. In view of what has been noticed hereinabove, the net result of
crime test and criminal test could be summarised as follows : The
present case had been of extreme inhumane acts and actions of the
appellant where, amongst other offending acts and actions, he:
(1) kidnapped the victim girl, who was only 7 1/2 years of age, who
was even otherwise a mentally and physically challenged child, with
betrayal of trust when the victim girl got lured with confectionary
items given by him;
(2) brutally raped the victim girl, as noticeable from the gruesome
injuries on and around her private parts and as established by the
medical officers who conducted post-mortem; and
(3) mercilessly killed the victim girl by causing horrid injuries on
her head, as established not only by the doctors but also by the
surrounding facts, including bloodstains on the scene of crime, on
the motorcycle, and on the clothing of the appellant at the time of
his arrest.
On the personal score, even though the appellant was about 28 years of
age and was having the family of wife, a daughter who was also about
8 years of age and aged parents, he was continuously involved in
criminal activities. Even if the other past cases are left aside, he
committed the crimes in question by using a stolen motorcycle.
Unfortunately, the matter does not end here.
114. The tremors thrown by the appellant to shock anyone's
conscience with his beastly conduct have not stopped even with this
inhumane crime and even after his conviction.
115. As noticed, in a substantial number of cases, when nothing
further exacerbates the crime in question, the courts have refrained
from awarding or approving death sentence even in the cases of
gruesome killings, essentially on the premise that even a semblance of
probability of reformation of the convict ought to be given a chance,
rather than awarding capital punishment, which is of irretrievable
nature. In this regard, the jail conduct of the convict carries its own
bearing and relevance in the overall consideration; and this Court has
leaned in favour of commuting the sentence of death to that of
imprisonment for life in case of unblemished jail conduct, even if the
crime itself had been of gruesome or abhorrent nature 54, 55 . However,
in the present case, the further shocking and disturbing factor is that
even while in jail, the appellant's conduct has not been free from
blemish where, apart from quarrelling with other inmate on 17-4-2015
and earning 7 days' punishment, the appellant had been accused and
convicted of the offence of yet another murder, this time of a co-inmate
of the jail, while joining hands with three other inmates.
116. At this juncture, we may again point out that the fact regarding
the appellant's involvement in another murder while being in jail and
his conviction of the offence under Sections 302/34 IPC came to be
stated only in the written
submissions filed on behalf of the respondent State after conclusion of
hearing. Such a fact having not been specified during the course of
hearing, we posted the matter for further directions and, on 14-2-2022
(sic 16-2-2022-8, the State was directed to place the relevant facts on
record with affidavit of the officer concerned. In compliance thereof, an
affidavit of Rakesh Mohan Sharma, Superintendent, Central Jail, Jaipur
has been filed and a copy of judgment and order dated 10-1-2020 in
Sessions Case No. 204 of 2019 by the Court of Special Judge
(Prevention of Sati) and Additional Sessions Judge, Jaipur Metropolitan
has also been filed. A perusal of the material placed on record makes it
clear that the appellant, with three other jail inmates, has been
convicted by the trial court of the offence under Sections 302/34 IPC
for murder of another jail inmate, who was a Pakistani national in the
high security cell of the prison; and that the appellant has been
awarded the sentence of imprisonment for life. Though it has been
pointed out that an appeal against the said decision is pending and we
would not be making any comments on the merits of that case at all
but, the appellant's culpable conduct in jail compels us to ponder over
the question as to whether it would be realistic to believe on the
probability of his reformation and rehabilitation yet.
117. We may also observe that even though the rarest of the rare
doctrine and its accompanying principles, as enunciated and explained
in Bachan Singh10 and Machhi Singh11, have been almost uniformly
applied by courts in the country while dealing with the question of
sentencing when the statute provides for death penalty; and over the
time, even the proposition of larger/longer term of actual imprisonment
with no remission or curtailed remission has also evolved but, it has
never been the effort of the courts to somehow make this punishment
(sentence of death) redundant and non-existent for all practical
purposes. The quest for justice in such cases, with death sentence
being awarded and maintained only in extreme cases, does not mean
that the matter would be approached and examined in the manner that
death sentence has to be avoided, even if the matter indeed calls for
such a punishment. The judicial process, in our view, would be
compromising on its objectivity if the approach is to nullify the
statutory provision carrying death sentence as an alternative
punishment for major offences (like that of Section 302 IPC), even after
it has passed muster of judicial scrutiny and has been held not
unconstitutional. The pursuit in collecting mitigating circumstances
could also not be taken up with any notion or idea that somehow, some
factor be found; or if not found, be deduced anyhow so that the
sentence of death be forsaken. Such an approach would be unrealistic,
unwarranted and rather not upholding the rule of law.
118. An attempt has been made to suggest on behalf of the
appellant that his overall conduct in prison is without any blemish
except the allegation of his involvement in a case of murder. We could
only wonder what more of criminal
activity would qualify as blemish, if not the involvement and conviction
in a case of murder of a fellow jail inmate! This is apart from the other
7 days' punishment earned by the appellant for quarrelling with
another jail inmate.
119. We may also take into account another suggestion made on
behalf of the appellant that his psychological evaluation report may be
called.
120. In Anil V. State of Maharashtra³ 56 this Court observed that in
appropriate cases, after conviction, the Court may call for report to
determine whether the accused could be reformed or rehabilitated; and
it would depend on the facts and circumstances of each case57 Again,
there cannot be any universal formula for calling for a report in terms of
the said decision in Anil56 For example, in the present case, where the
appellant is found to be indulging incessantly in criminal activities
before the crime in question; has carried out gruesome deeds of the
present crime; has further been involved in questionable jail conduct,
including quarrelling with a fellow inmate and earning 7 days'
punishment; and then, to cap it all, has been involved in an offence of
no less degree than murder of another jail inmate, calling for any
further report of the likelihood of reformation and rehabilitation of the
appellant could be proposed only if the judicial process is determined to
annul the death sentence altogether, by finding one way or the other to
avoid the same in every case. Such an approach would be counter-
productive to the entire system of maintenance of order in the society;
and could be countenanced only if we would be inclined to think that
whatever be the society's cry for justice, the statutory provision of
death sentence should itself be given its interment or burial. Obviously,
this approach would be squarely contrary to the statutory mandates as
also the principles enunciated by multiple Constitution Bench decisions
of this Court; and would strike at the roots of the rule of law. In the
given set of circumstances of this case, the suggestions about calling
for any so-called psychological evaluation report could only be termed
as impractical and unrealistic and could only be rejected.
121. In the present case, where all the elements surrounding the
offence as also all the elements surrounding the offender cut across the
balance sheet of aggravating and mitigating circumstances, we are
clearly of the view that there is absolutely no reason to commute the
sentence of death to any other sentence of lesser degree. Even the
alternative of awarding the sentence of imprisonment for whole of the
natural life with no remission does not appear justified in view of the
nature of crimes committed by the appellant and looking to his
incorrigible conduct.
122. We may sum up thus:
122.1. In the case of the present nature, the crime had been of
extreme depravity, which shocks the conscience, particularly looking to
the target (a seven-and-a-half-year-old mentally and physically
challenged girl) and then, looking to the manner of committing murder,
where the hapless victim's head was literally smashed, resulting in
multiple injuries including fracture of frontal
bone. This is apart from the facts that the innocent victim was
kidnapped on a stolen motorcycle by misusing the trust gained by offer
of confectionary items and also, apart from the fact that she was
brutally and inhumanly raped.
122.2. Taking up the test parameters pertaining to the criminal (i.e.
the appellant), of course, he has a family with wife and minor daughter
and aged father and the crime was committed when he was only 28
years of age. However, these mitigating factors are pitted against
several other factors pertaining to the appellant himself. One, being of
his activities and actions before the present crime where he was found
involved in at least four cases with offences ranging from Section 3 of
the Prevention of Damage to Public Property Act, 1984, Section 379 IPC
and even Section 307 IPC. Second, being the fact that the present
crime itself was carried out with the aid of a stolen motorcycle. Third,
and crucial one being his conduct post-conviction where he not only
earned 7 days' punishment in jail for quarrelling with a co-inmate but
he has been convicted of the offence of murder of another jail inmate.
122.3. Read as a whole, the fact-sheet concerning the appellant
leads only to the logical deduction that there is no possibility that he
would not relapse again in this crime if given any indulgence. A fortiori,
there appears no probability of his reformation and rehabilitation. This
possibility of the appellant relapsing in the same crime over again and
nil probability of his reformation/rehabilitation is a direct challenge as
also danger to the maintenance of order in the society. Hence, the facts
of the present case, taken as a whole, make it clear that it is unlikely
that the appellant, if given an absolution, would not be capable of and
would not be inclined to commit such a crime again. Consequently, we
find it to be a case of no other option but to confirm the death sentence
awarded to the appellant, for that being inevitable in this particular
case.
123. Before concluding on this matter, we deem it appropriate to
put on record our appreciation for the learned Senior Counsel appearing
in legal aid for the appellant who, despite having a tough brief to
handle, has attempted his best to espouse the cause of the appellant.
K. Conclusion
124. Accordingly, these appeals are dismissed; conviction of the
appellant of the offences under Sections 363, 365, 376(2)(f), 302 of
the Penal Code, 1860 and Section 6 of the Protection of Children from
Sexual Offences Act, 2012 is confirmed; and the sentences awarded to
the appellant, including the death sentence for the offence under
Section 302 of the Penal Code, 1860, are also confirmed.

Having regard to the nature of the case, the name of victim has been omitted in the
narrations and extractions and at all other places in this judgment; and is substituted by the
expression 'K'. For clarification, it may also be stated that the name of victim girl has been
mentioned differently and with alias at different places. But her identity is otherwise not in
dispute and we have retained the substituted expression 'K' at every place, irrespective of
any of the alternative names appearing.

It may be indicated that the depositions and substantial part of the relevant documents in
the original record as also the judgment of the trial court are in Hindi language. One set of
translations of the depositions has been supplied by the High Court and another set of
translations has been placed on record by the respondent State with its reply affidavit. We
have scanned through the record with the assistance of the learned counsel for the parties;
and the extracts in this judgment are with reference to the translations available on record
and also, as far as feasible, near to the meaning of the text in original.
4
It may be indicated that this witness PW 25 also asserted about the appellant having made
other disclosures like the place where he smashed the head of the victim girl on hard gravelly
surface (stone) upon her resistance; and having smashed her forehead between silencer and
engine of motorcycle, etc. These parts of his testimony as also other parts of formal nature
have been omitted from extraction.
5
The High Court appears to have gathered an impression that some "stone" was recovered
at the instance of the appellant with reference to the memo dated 21-1-2013 (Ext. P-23)
and statements of PW 7 Kuldeep Singh and PW 8 Ajay Singh as also PW 25 Umesh Ojha,
where they indicated that the appellant-accused had shown the place of incident and hard
gravelly surface with stone whereupon did he smash the head of the victim while committing
rape. It does not appear that any "stone" was as such recovered and seized. However, this
aspect is not of material bearing on the substance of the matter.

The value and worth of DNA profile matching in criminal cases has been succinctly stated
"18. Deoxyribonucleic acid, or DNA, is a molecule that encodes the genetic information in all
living organisms. DNA genotype can be obtained from any biological material such as bone,
blood, semen, saliva, hair, skin, etc. Now, for several years, DNA profile has also shown a
tremendous impact on forensic investigation. Generally, when DNA profile of a sample found
at the scene of crime matches with the DNA profile of the suspect, it can generally
be
concluded that both the samples have the same biological origin. DNA profile is valid and
reliable, but variance in a particular result depends on the quality control and quality
procedure in the laboratory."
30
The Constitution Bench underscored the significance and worth of judicial discretion in the
"26.
The impossibility of laying down standards is at the very core of the criminal law as
administered in India which invests the Judges with a very wide discretion in the matter of
fixing the degree of punishment. The discretion in the matter of sentence is, as already
pointed out, liable to be corrected by superior courts. Laying down of standards to the
limited extent possible as was done in the Model Judicial Code would not serve the purpose.
The exercise of judicial discretion on well-recognised principles is, in the final analysis, the
safest possible safeguards for the accused."

illustration of this approach where, despite finding it to be similar case of gruesome rape and
murder of a seven-year-old girl child, we found the unblemished jail conduct coupled with
other circumstances indicating the probability of reformation of the convict and hence,
commuted the death sentence into that of imprisonment for life but with stipulations of his
undergoing actual imprisonment for a period of 30 years.
approach where, despite finding it to be similar case of gruesome rape and murder of an eight
-year-old girl child, who was daughter of the cousin of the convict, we observed that the
convict's unblemished jail conduct coupled with other mitigating circumstances would not go
unnoticed; and probability of reformation and rehabilitation of the convict was not ruled out.
Hence, we again adopted the course of commuting the death sentence into that of
imprisonment for life with stipulations of actual imprisonment for a period of 30 years.
