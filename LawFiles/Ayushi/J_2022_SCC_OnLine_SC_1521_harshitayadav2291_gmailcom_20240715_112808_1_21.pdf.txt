Decided on November 4, 2022
The Judgment of the Court was delivered by
ANIRUDDHA BOSE, J.: - Leave granted.
2. In this judgment, we shall deal with the legality of certain amendments and
modifications made by the Central Government to the Employees' Pension Scheme,
1995 ("1995 Scheme"). Such scheme has been made in pursuance of, inter-alia,
Section 6A of the Employees' Provident Funds and Miscellaneous Provisions Act, 1952
("the Act"). Such changes, inter-alia, are sought be effected in paragraphs 3, 6, 11, 12
and 14 of the 1995 scheme. The Act originally did not provide for any pension scheme
and Section 6A was introduced to the said Act by way of an amendment made in
1995. The amendment of 1995 contemplated formulation of a scheme for employees'
pension and the pension fund was to comprise of deposit of 8.33 per cent of the
employers' contribution made towards provident fund corpus as per the prevailing
Statue. Paragraph 11 of the scheme dealt with determination of pensionable salary. At
that point of time, maximum pensionable salary was Rs. 5000/- and this sum had
been enhanced subsequently to Rs. 6500/-. Pensionable salary was raised to Rs.
15000/- by a notification dated 22nd August 2014 [numbered G.S.R. 609 (E)] which
was
to
be effective from 1 st September 2014. This notification brought certain other
modifications in the scheme mainly restricting its coverage and we shall discuss these
modifications later in this judgment.
3. In the appeals before us, judgments of the High Courts of Kerala, Rajasthan and
Delhi are assailed. In the case of P. Sasikumar V. Union of India (UOI) Represented by
the Secretary to Govt. of India Ministry of Labour & Department of Employment [in
Writ Petition (C) No. 13120 of 2015], a Division Bench of the Kerala High Court in its
judgment delivered on 12th October 2018 set aside the Employees' Pension
Amendment (Scheme), 2014 conceived in G.S.R. 609 (E). The Delhi High Court in its
judgment delivered on 22nd May 2019 in the case of Bhartiya Khadya Nigam
Karamchari Sangh V. Union of India [in Writ Petition (C) No. 5678 of 2018] followed
the view expressed by the Kerala High Court and quashed a circular issued by the
provident fund authorities on 31 st May 2017 precluding exempted establishments from
the benefits of higher pension. In a decision delivered on 28th August 2019 in the case
of Union of India V. Jale Singh [in D.B. Special Appeal Writ No. 436 of 2019] a Division
Bench of the Rajasthan High Court also expressed the same opinion. Appeals arising
out of SLP (C) No. 3289 of 2021, SLP (C) No. 3290 of 2021, SLP (C) No. 2465 of 2021
and SLP (C) No. 3287 of 2021 are directed against the aforesaid judgment of the
Rajasthan High Court and a subsequent decision of a Bench of equal strength
delivered on 24th September 2019 in the same line. The appeals originating from SLP
(C) Nos. 15063-15064 of 2022 are against the judgment of the Delhi High Court
delivered on 22nd May 2019, whereas in appeals having their roots in SLP (C) No. 1366
of 2021, SLP (C) No. 1738 of 2021, judgments of the Delhi High Court delivered
following the case of Bhartiya Khadya Nigam Karamchari Sangh (supra) have been
assailed. In another judgment delivered by the same Bench of the Kerala High Court
in the case of Sunil Kumar V. Union of India [in Writ Petition (C) No. 602 of 2015] on
the same day, i.e. 12 th October 2018, the aforesaid notification of 22nd August 2014
was invalidated. That judgment is under challenge in the appeals in connection with
SLP (C) Nos. 16721-16722 of 2019. In a contempt action brought before the Kerala
High Court by aspiring beneficiaries of the pension scheme for implementation of the
directions issued in the judgment dated 12th October 2018, certain directions have
th
been issued by the Kerala High Court. The judgment to that effect delivered on 6
November 2020 is impugned in SLP (C) No. 8547 of 2021.
4. Fifty-four writ petitions have been filed by the employees themselves or on their
behalf under Article 32 of the Constitution of India seeking invalidation of the
notification dated 22nd August 2014. The writ petitioners are members of both
exempted and unexempted establishments. We shall address these writ petitions as
well in this judgment, as they involve the same questions of law. We find that notices
are yet to be issued in W.P. (C) No. 1356 of 2021, W.P. (C) No. 1379 of 2021, W.P.
(C) No. 767 of 2021 and W.P. (C) No. 477 of 2021 but these petitions also involve the
same questions of law and the main respondents have participated in addressing us
on these points. As such, these writ petitions shall also be dealt with in this judgment.
We have also heard the intervenors, most of whom support the employees. In
addition, there are contempt petitions (Contempt Petition (C) Nos. 1917-1918 of 2018
and Contempt Petition (C) No. 619-620 of 2019) in which implementation of a
judgment of this Court in the case of R.C. Gupta V. Regional Provident Fund
on October 2016 has been asked for. This judgment dealt with the question of
entitlement of members of the pension scheme, whose pensionable salary exceeded
Rs. 6500/- per month to exercise option in terms of proviso to paragraph 11 (3) of the
scheme. In this judgment, a Division Bench of this Court repelled the contention of the
provident fund authorities that the said proviso contemplated exercise of option within
a specified time. The said proviso has been omitted by the amendment of 2014. Rs.
6500/- was the maximum pensionable salary prior to 1 st September 2014. We shall
discuss this judgment in greater detail later.
5. With effect from 16th March 1996, the proviso was added to paragraph (3) of
the scheme giving an option to the employer and employee for contribution on salary
exceeding the aforesaid ceiling of Rs. 6500/-, (which was Rs. 5000/- per month prior
to 8th October 2001) to retain the right to pension as per the scheme. 8.33 per cent of
employer's contribution of salary of an employee out of the deductible amount towards
provident fund had to be remitted to the pension fund. Stand of the authorities was
that there were certain restrictions as regards the time for exercising such option. A
set of employees had approached the provident fund authorities much beyond such
perceived specified date, mostly on the eve of their retirement, seeking to be included
in the pension scheme. The point urged by them was that the amendment of 1996
was not within their knowledge, the same not having been widely publicised. The
provident fund authorities had rejected their plea. One set of employees successfully
brought action before a Single Judge of the High Court of Himachal Pradesh. Their
right to exercise such option beyond the time of their salary exceeding the pensionable
limit was in question. According to the authorities, that was the cut-off limit. The
Division Bench of the High Court, however, accepted the stand of the provident fund
authorities holding that paragraph 11(3) of the pension scheme, as it prevailed then,
stipulated a cut-off limit. The matter ultimately came to this Court and in the case of
R.C. Gupta (supra), a Division Bench of this Court accepted the employees' stand and,
inter-alia, held:-
7. Reading the proviso, we find that the reference to the date of
commencement of the Scheme or the date on which the salary exceeds the ceiling
limit are dates from which the option exercised are to be reckoned with for
calculation of pensionable salary. The said dates are not cut-off dates to determine
the eligibility of the employer-employee to indicate their option under the proviso to
Clause 11(3) of the Pension Scheme. A somewhat similar view that has been taken
by this Court in a matter coming from the Kerala High Court [Union of India V. A.
Majeed Kunju, Writ Appeal No. 1135 of 2012, order dated 5-3-2013 (Ker)], wherein
Special Leave Petition (C) No. 7074 of 2014 filed by the Regional Provident Fund
Commissioner was rejected by this Court by order dated 31-3-2016 [Regl.
was directed: "SLPs (C) Nos. 7074-76, 7107-108, 7224 of 2014 and 697 of 2016
Heard the learned counsel for the parties and perused the relevant material. We do
not find any legal and valid ground for interference. The special leave petitions are
dismissed SLPs (C) Nos. 19954 and 33032-33 of 2015 List these special leave
petitions on 26-4-2016. As prayed for, liberty is granted to file additional
documents. "]. A beneficial scheme, in our considered view, ought not to be allowed
to be defeated by reference to a cut-off date, particularly, in a situation where (as in
the present case) the employer had deposited 12% of the actual salary and not
12% of the ceiling limit of Rs. 5000 or Rs. 6500 per month, as the case may be.
8. XXX XXX XXX
9. We do not see how exercise of option under Para 26 of the Provident Fund
Scheme can be construed to estop the employees from exercising a similar option
under Para 1(3). If both the employer and the employee opt for deposit against
the actual salary and not the ceiling amount, exercise of option under Para 26 of the
Provident Scheme is inevitable. Exercise of the option under Para 26(6) is a
necessary precursor to the exercise of option under Clause 11(3). Exercise of such
option, therefore, would not foreclose the exercise of a further option under Clause
11 (3) of the Pension Scheme unless the circumstances warranting such foreclosure
are clearly indicated.
10. The above apart in a situation where the deposit of the employer's share at
12% has been on the actual salary and not the ceiling amount, we do not see how
the Provident Fund Commissioner could have been aggrieved to file the LPA before
the Division Bench of the High Court. All that the Provident Fund Commissioner is
required to do in the case is an adjustment of accounts which in turn would have
benefited some of the employees. At best what the Provident Commissioner could
do and which we permit him to do under the present order is to seek a return of all
such amounts that the employees concerned may have taken or withdrawn from
their provident fund account before granting them the benefit of the proviso to
Clause 11(3) of the Pension Scheme. Once such a return is made in whichever
cases such return is due, consequential benefits in terms of this order will be
granted to the said employees."
6. Further modification to the scheme, as we have already indicated, came on 22'
August 2014 to be effective from st September 2014. Paragraph 11 of the scheme,
before such modification by G.S.R. No. 609 (E) of 22n August 2014 was introduced,
and subsequent to the said G.S.R. becoming operational, read:-

7. The legality of the modified scheme was questioned in different writ petitions in
different High Courts. The Bench decisions of the High Courts of Kerala, Rajasthan and
Delhi went in favour of the employees. The appeals which we shall be dealing with in
this judgment arise out of the decisions of the said High Courts. We shall mainly be
addressing the judgment of the Division Bench of the Kerala High Court delivered on
12 October 2018 [in Writ Petition (C) No. 13120 of 2015] which sustained the
employees' contentions and invalidated the notification of 22 August 2014. The
nd
Division Benches of the Rajasthan and Delhi High Court followed the ratio of the
decision in the case of R. C. Gupta (supra) broadly on the same reasoning forming
foundation of the judgment of the Kerala High Court. The petitions for special leave to
appeal filed by the Employees Provident Fund Organization ("EPFO") [SLP (Civil) Nos.
8658-59 of 2019] assailing the judgment of the Division Bench of the Kerala High
Court was initially dismissed by a Coordinate Bench of this Court on st April 2019. In
SLP (C) Nos. 16721-16722 of 2019, the Union of India also appealed against the same
judgment. A Review Petition was filed by the EPFO in respect of the order dated 1st
April 2019 dismissing their Special Leave Petition. On 12th July 2019, this Court
directed listing of the SLPs filed by the Union of India along with the Review Petitions
in open Court. On 29th January 2021, this Court allowed the Review Petitions and the
order of 1st April 2019 was recalled. A point has been taken on behalf of the
employees that the Employees Provident Fund Organisation has no locus standi to
maintain these appeals. This objection is technical in nature and having regard to the
fact that we are also hearing writ petitions challenging the legality of the 2014
amendments, we do not consider it necessary to dilate on this issue. Moreover, in the
appeals arising out of SLP (C) Nos. 16721-16722 of 2019, the Union of India is the
appellant. Since the amendment made by the Central Government has been quashed,
the locus of Union of India remains undisputed.
8. The pension scheme was conceived by way of introduction of Section 6A to the
1952 Act, under Act 25 of 1996, with effect from 16th November 1995. The said
Section stipulates:
"6A. Employees' Pension Scheme -
(1) The Central Government may, by notification in the Official Gazette, frame a
scheme to be called the Employees' Pension Scheme for the purpose of
providing for-
(a) superannuation pension, retiring pension or permanent total disablement

9. Under the same Amendment Act, Sections 2(kA) and 2(kB) were introduced to
the Act. These provisions specify: -
"2. Definitions.-In this Act, unless the context otherwise requires,-
[(kA) "Pension Fund" means the Employees' Pension Fund established under sub
-section (2) of section 6A;] [(kB) "Pension Scheme" means the Employees' Pension
Scheme framed under sub-section (1) of section 6A;]"
10. The pension scheme was framed in terms of Section 6A of the Act and brought
into operation by G.S.R. 748(E) dated 16th November 1995. The crucial paragraph, so
far as these proceedings are concerned, is paragraph 11 thereof. We have already
quoted this paragraph. The quantum of pension is to be fixed as per the formula
specified in paragraph 12 of the scheme, which contemplates, inter-alia,
superannuation pension for a member of the Scheme after service of 10 years and
retiring on attaining the age of 58 years. Sub-clause (2) of paragraph 12 as sought to
be amended by the 2014 amendment stipulates the methodology of computation of
monthly member's pension. Sub-clauses (1) and (2) of this paragraph are reproduced
below:
"12. Monthly Member's Pension. - (1) A member shall be entitled to:
(a) superannuation pension if he has rendered eligible service of 10 years or
more and retires on attaining the age of 58 years;
(b) early pension, if he has rendered eligible service of 10 years or more and
retires or otherwise ceases to be in the employment before attaining the age
of 58 years.
12 (2). In the case of a new entrant, the amount of monthly superannuation
pension or early pension, as the case may be, shall be computed in accordance with
the following factors, namely:-
Monthly member's pension = Pensionable Salary X Pensionable Service 70
Provided that the members' monthly pension shall be determined on a pro-rata
basis for the pensionable service up to the 1st day of September, 2014 at the
maximum pensionable salary of six thousand and five hundred rupees per month
and for the period thereafter at the maximum pensionable salary of fifteen thousand
rupees per month. "
11. The initial entry into the pension scheme is contemplated in paragraph 26(6) of
Employees Provident Funds Scheme, 1952 read with paragraph 6 of the pension
scheme. Paragraph 6 of the pension scheme as it stood prior to the amendment of
22nd August 2014 and thereafter reads:- -

Explanation. -An employee shall cease to be the
member of Pension Fund from the date of attaining
58 years of age or from the date of vesting

is earlier. "
12. Section 7 of the 1952 Act empowers the Central Government to amend the said
scheme both prospectively and retrospectively, subject to certain procedural
compliances, as outlined in the said provision. This provision specifies:-
"7. Modification of scheme.-
(1) The Central Government may, by notification in the Official Gazette, add to
[amend or vary, either prospectively or retrospectively, the Scheme, the
[Pension] Scheme or the Insurance Scheme, as the case may be].
[(2) Every notification issued under sub-section (1) shall be laid, as soon as may
be after it is issued, before each House of Parliament, while it is in session, for
a
total period of thirty days, which may be comprised in one session or in two
or more successive sessions, and if, before the expiry of the session
immediately following the session or the successive sessions aforesaid, both
Houses agree in making any modification in the notification, or both Houses
agree that the notification should not be issued, the notification shall
thereafter have effect only in such modified form or be of no effect, as the
case may be; so, however, that any such modification or annulment shall be
without prejudice to the validity of anything previously done under that
notification.]"
13. The judgment of this Court in R.C. Gupta (supra) was delivered examining the
provisions of paragraph 11 of the scheme as it stood prior to issue of the 2014
notification. The changes brought by the amended provision altered the methodology
of computing pensionable salary, which ultimately would have an impact on the
quantum of monthly pension. Instead of taking twelve months of average pay in the
year preceding the date of a member's exit from the pension fund, computation was
contemplated on the basis of average monthly pay drawn during the contributory
period of service in the span of 60 months preceding the date of exit.
14. In the post amendment context, the maximum pensionable salary was to be
kept to Rs. 15000/- per month, raising the earlier ceiling of Rs. 6500/- per month. It
was also provided that an existing member who, at the option of the employer and
employee as on 1 st September 2014, had been contributing on a salary exceeding Rs.
6500/- per month could exercise fresh option jointly with the employer to continue to
remain in the fund even if the salary went beyond Rs. 15000/- per month and the
pensionable salary for the existing member exercising such an option was to be based
on the higher salary.
15. As per paragraph 3(ii) of the pension scheme, the Central Government was to
contribute to the fund at the rate of 1.16 per cent of the pay of the members.
Employees within the changed pension regime drawing more than Rs. 15000/- per
month have to also contribute at the rate of 1.16 per cent on salary exceeding Rs.
15000/- as additional contribution each month under the amended provisions. Further,
fresh option was to be exercised by the member within a period of six months from
the 1st day of September 2014, which was extendable up to about 6 months on
sufficient cause shown by the member.
16. Under the post-2014 regime, the fourth proviso to sub-clause (4) of paragraph
11 specifies that if no option is exercised by a member within the aforesaid period, it
would be deemed that the concerned member has not opted for contribution over the
wage ceiling. In such a case, the contributions to the pension fund made beyond the
wage limit in respect of such a member is to be diverted to the provident fund account
of the member along with interest, as declared under the provident fund scheme from
time to time.
17. It was held in the case of R. C. Gupta (supra), dealing with pre-2014 position of
the scheme that the dates or time-limit specified in clause 11(3) of the pension
scheme were not cut-off dates. The said time-limit determined the eligibility of the
employer and employee to exercise their option under the proviso to the said
paragraph. It was also observed in this judgment that a beneficial scheme ought not
to be allowed to be defeated by refence to a cut-off date in a situation where the
employer was not following the ceiling limit of Rs. 5000/- or Rs. 6500/- and had
deposited 12 per cent of the actual salary.
18. Main submission of the employees in support of the judgments under appeal
has been that there was no additional burden imposed on the provident fund
authorities or the Central Government if the earlier system continued and no cut-off
date was factored in, as entry into the hybrid regime of provident fund plus pension
beyond the ceiling limit only entailed switching of funds. The authorities had to remit
the 8.33 per cent from the employer's share of the contribution lying in the provident
fund corpus to the corpus of the pension fund. It has been argued before us that the
pattern of investment that was permissible under both the schemes were broadly the
same and hence interest generated by such investment ought to correspond to in each
situation.
19. The Division Bench of the Kerala High Court examined the impact of the
amendment to the pension scheme in respect of the following classes of pensioners or
potential pensioners:
"(i) Employees who had exercised option under the proviso to para 11 (3) of the
1995 Scheme and continued to be in service as on September 2014.
(ii) Employees who had not exercised their option under the proviso to paragraph
(3) of the 1995 Scheme and were continuing in service as on September
2014.
(iii) Employees who had retired prior to 1st September 2014 without exercising an
option under paragraph 11 (3) of the 1995 Act scheme.
(iv) Employees who had retired prior to 1st September 2014 after exercising of an
option under the paragraph 11 (3) of the 1995 Scheme."
20. It was held by the Kerala High Court, following the judgment of this Court in
the case of R.C. Gupta (supra), that paragraph 11 of the pension scheme did not
stipulate a cut-off date at all. Any such stipulation, in the opinion of the High Court,
would have the effect of defeating the purpose of a beneficial scheme. After the
relevant date, that is st September 2014, on the question of capping the salary to Rs.
15000/- per month for continuing in the pension scheme, it was, inter-alia, held by
the High Court:-
"33. As per the amendments, the maximum pensionable salary has been fixed at
Rs. 15,000/- thereby disentitling the persons who have contributed on the basis of
their actual salaries to any benefits on the basis of the excess contributions made
by them. The said provision is arbitrary and cannot be sustained. The employees,
who have been making contributions on the basis of their actual salaries after
submitting a joint option with their employers as required by the Pension Scheme,
are denied the benefits of their contributions by the said amendments without any
justification. Apart from the above, to cap the salary at Rs. 15,000/- for quantifying
pension is absolutely unrealistic. A monthly salary of Rs. 15,000/- works out only to
about Rs. 500/- per day. It is common knowledge that, even a manual labourer is
paid more than the said amounts as daily wages. Therefore, to limit the maximum
salary at Rs. 15,000/- for pension would deprive most of the employees of a decent
pension in their old age. Since the pension scheme is intended to provide succour
to the retired employees, the said object would be defeated by capping the salary.
The duty of the trustees of the Fund is to administer the same for the benefit of the
employees - by wise investments and efficient management. They have no right to
deny the pension legitimately due to them on the ground that the fund would get
depleted. The demand of additional payment of 1.16% of their salaries exceeding
Rs. 15,000/- is unsustainable for the reason that, Section 6A does not require the
employees to make any additional contribution to constitute the Pension Fund. Non
does it empower the authorities to demand additional contribution. In the absence
of any statutory backing, the said provision in the Pension Scheme is ultra vires.
The amendment in so far as it stipulates the average monthly pay drawn over a
span of 60 months preceding the date of exit as the pensionable service is also
arbitrary for the reason that it deprives the employees of a substantial portion of
the pension to which they would have been eligible had it not been for the
amendment. The provision as it originally stood stipulated computation of
pensionable salary on the basis of the monthly pay drawn over a period of 12
months prior to their exit. The reason for the amendments as disclosed by the
counter affidavit filed is that payment of pension on the basis of the Scheme as it
stood prior to the amendment would result in depletion of the Fund. Absolutely no
material or data to support the above contention has been placed before us. On the
contrary, placing reliance on a news report carried by "The Hindu" newspaper on
17.8.2014, it is contended by the petitioners that, a staggering amount of Rs.
32,000 Crores of unclaimed amount is lying in various inoperative accounts across
the country, as unclaimed pension as disclosed by the Central Provident Fund
Commissioner at an interactive session with employees at Hyderabad. In the
absence of any material to support the contention that the fund is likely to be
depleted, we reject the said contention. Apart from the above, there is no provision
in the Act that stipulates the pension payments to commensurate with the amounts
actually remitted by an employee and his employer. It is also a fact that the
administrators of the Fund invest the amounts and generate profit from such
investments."
21. The High Court made its assessment of ground realities on the wage structures
in the economy and found capping of Rs. 15000/- per month as pensionable salary
would deprive most of the employees of decent pension in their old age.
22. As regards requirement of an employee to contribute 1.16 per cent of their pay
under the amended scheme, the High Court found that there is no statutory basis
under which an employee can be made to make additional contribution to the pension
fund. On the aspect of altering the basis of calculation of average monthly pay, the
High Court held such alteration to be arbitrary as it deprived the employees of a
substantial portion of the pension to which they would have been entitled to under the
scheme as it originally prevailed. On justification of the amendment on potential
depletion of fund, a point which has also been argued before us by the EPFO, it was
observed by the High Court that there was no material or data to support this
contention taken by the fund organisation. The High Court also referred to the growing
number of workforce in our country, which, as per this judgment, was constantly
adding to the base of the fund by accumulation to fund contribution. In paragraphs 37
and 38 of the judgment under appeal, the reasoning of the High Court was
summarised:-
"37. The stated objective of the amendments is to prevent depletion of the fund.
The said apprehension is absolutely baseless for the reasons stated above. The
number of persons who are contributing to the Provident Fund as well as the
Pension Fund have only grown over the years. The work force in our country would
only grow further in the future. It has to be stated here that in view of the increase
in the number of workers over the years, the contributions would also grow. The
phenomenon is only bound to continue in future. Therefore, even when payments of
pension are made to the retired employees, the pension fund would continue to get
replenished with the contributions of the new entrants. The said ongoing process
would maintain the Fund in a stable condition. If at all, a situation where the Fund
base gets eroded occurs, the situation could be remedied at that time by enhancing
the rates of contributions of persons contributing to the Fund through a legislative
exercise. The attempt to maintain the stability of the fund by reducing the pension
would only be counter productive and would defeat the very purpose of the
enactment.
38. As rightly contended by the counsel appearing for the petitioners, the effect
of the amendments to the Pension Scheme is to create different classes of
pensioners on the basis of the date, 1.9.2014, the date on which the amended
Scheme came into force. Consequentlv, there would be -
(i) employees who have exercised option under the proviso to paragraph 11(3) of
the 1995 Scheme and continuing in service as on 1.9.2014;
(ii) employees who have not exercised their option under the proviso to
paragraph (1(3) of the 1995 Scheme, and continuing in service as on
1.9.2014;
(iii) employees who have retired prior to 1.9.2014 without exercising an option
under paragraph (3) of the 1995 Scheme; (iv) employees who have retired
prior to 1.9.2014 after exercising the option under paragraph 11(3) of 1995
Scheme. The rationale in SO classifying the employees covered by the Pension
Scheme on the basis of the above date is not forthcoming. The object sought
to be achieved is stated to be prevention of depletion of the Pension Fund,
which cannot be accepted as a justification to support the classification.
Inasmuch as the statutory scheme is to make the Pension Fund ensure to the
benefit of the homogeneous class of the totality of employees covered by the
Provident Fund, a further classification of the said class by formulating a
Scheme is ultra vires the power available to the Central Government under
Sections 5 and 7 of the EPF Act. Therefore, it has to be held that, the
impugned amendments are arbitrary, ultra vires the EPF Act and
unsustainable. For the foregoing reasons, the petitioners are entitled to
succeed. The writ petitions are all allowed as follows:
i) The Employee's Pension (Amendment) Scheme, 2014 brought into force by
Notification No. GSR. 609(E) dated 22.8.2014 evidenced by Ext.P8 in W.P.
(C) No. 13120 of 2015 is set aside;
ii) All consequential orders and proceedings issued by the Provident Fund
authorities/respondents on the basis of the impugned amendments shall
also stand set aside.
iii) The various proceedings issued by the Employees Provident Fund
Organisation declining to grant opportunities to the petitioners to exercise a
joint option along with other employees to remit contributions to the
Employees Pension Scheme on the basis of the actual salaries drawn by
them are set aside.
iv) The employees shall be entitled to exercise the option stipulated by
paragraph 26 of the EPF Scheme without being restricted in doing SO by the
insistence on a date.
v) There will be no order as to costs."
23. For these reasons, the High Court quashed the Employees' Pension
(Amendment) Scheme 2014 sought to be brought into force by notification no. G.S.R.
609(E) dated 22nd August 2014.
24. The first point on which argument has been made on behalf of the appellants
before us is that the aforesaid amendment had been made in exercise of power under
Section 7 of the 1952 Act read with entry 10 of the 111 Schedule of the Act. Thus, the
legislative authorisation is there for modification of a scheme whether prospectively or
retrospectively. Moreover, our attention has been drawn to paragraph 32 of the 1995
scheme, which stipulates:
"32. Valuation of the Employees' Pension Fund and review of the rates of
contributions and quantum of the pension and other benefits. - (1) The
Central Government shall have an annual valuation of the Employees' Pension Fund
made by a Valuer appointed by it:
Provided that it shall be open to the Central Government to direct a valuation to
be made at such other times it may consider necessary.
(2) At any time, when the Employees' Pension Fund SO permits, the Central
Government may alter the rate of contributions payable under this Scheme or the
scale of any benefit admissible under this Scheme or the period for which such
benefit may be given."
25. Entry 10 of the 111 Schedule to the Act, which refers to matters for which
provision may be made in the pension scheme, provides:-
"10. The scale of pension and pensionary benefits and the conditions relating to
grant of such benefits to the employees."
26. Stand of the appellants is that there has been no encroachment on any vested
legal right of existing members. It has been highlighted that after the 2014
amendments, the option of the members to further opt to remain in the scheme
beyond the ceiling limit has been taken away. But the existing option members who
had chosen to contribute beyond the salary limit has been permitted to exercise fresh
option to continue with such contribution upon payment of an additional 1.16 per cent
of their salary beyond the said ceiling.
27. In assailing the said judgments, it has also been contended on behalf of the
appellants that the membership of the pension scheme may have become a vested
right for those opting under paragraph 26(6) of the EPFS before amendment to
paragraph 6 of the pension scheme. Those who were yet to exercise option under
paragraph 26(6) could not claim such vested right of membership to pension scheme.
The omission of proviso 3 to paragraph 11 of the pension scheme also did not affect
the membership of those who had already come within the scheme by exercising
option under paragraph 26(6), but to remain in the scheme beyond the ceiling limit an
existing option member had to exercise fresh option.
28. Submission of the appellants is that all the employees of an establishment do
not constitute a homogenous class. It is within the power and authority of the Central
Government to differentiate between employees earning lower wages and those
earning higher salary and offer improved social benefits for those in the lower wage
bracket.
29. Arguments have been advanced on two other features of the post-amendment
scheme. Legality of requirement of the employees who go beyond the salary threshold
to contribute to the pension scheme at the rate of 1.16 per cent of their salary has
been questioned. The other point in controversy is that for existing pensioners also the
basis of computation of pensionable salary having changed, there could be reduction
in the monthly pension. It is, however, contention of the appellants that the
amendment had extended the period prescribed in paragraph 2(1) from 12 months
prior to a member's exit from the pension scheme to 60 months. This, according to
appellants, has been done to achieve a clearer picture of the pensionable salary to
eliminate the possibility of fluctuations in pay drawn in the last 12 months for
determining the quantum of pension. Illustration has been given of manual labourers
and women who drawing low wages, who may suffer such fluctuation on account of ill
health, incapacitation, etc., and in the case of such employees, if only 12 months' pay
is accounted for, they may get reduced pension.
30. On behalf of the employees it has been urged that the decision of this Court in
R.C. Gupta (supra) does not require any revisit as this decision has held good for
almost six years. In support of this argument, following authorities have been relied
upon:
(i) Bengal Immunity Company Limited V. State of Bihar [(1955) 2 SCR 603]
(iii) Keshav Mills Co. Ltd. V. Commissioner of Income Tax Bombay North,
Ahmedabad [(1965) 2 SCR 908]
31. In the given context, however, this point may not hold good as what we are
examining in this judgment is certain amendments to the scheme which were not
before this Court based on which the judgment of R.C. Gupta (supra) was delivered.
In the said judgment, the provisions of law as it subsisted prior to issue of the
amendment notification was considered. Thus, the ratio of the four authorities referred
to in the preceding paragraph would not be applicable in the given context.
32. The employees have argued that under the law, there is no requirement of
exercising second option. In this regard, our attention has been drawn to paragraphs 3
(1) and 3(2) of the scheme, which requires remittance of a part of contribution of the
employer to the provident fund scheme. The employees' argument is that the
obligation is only on the employer to remit the sum from one fund to the other. There
is no ceiling limit and the remittance required to be made is of 8.33 per cent of the
employee's pay. But this point also, in our opinion, does not aid the employees. While
paragraphs 3 and 6 of the scheme have laid down what the fund would be constituted
of and who would be the members of the pension scheme, paragraph 11, which is an
integral part of the pension scheme, specifies the criteria for those who become
mandatory members and, from among the existing members, who may be permitted
to exercise option to remain in the scheme in spite of drawing salary beyond the
ceiling limit. It is a fact that those who are covered by paragraph 26(6) of the
provident fund scheme automatically enters into the pension scheme as well. But this
provision cannot be held to have precluded the Central Government from laying down
conditions to remain eligible for the pension scheme and specify wage or salary ceiling
for individual employees beyond which the scheme may not operate. We also do not
accept the argument that the pension scheme considers employees as a homogenous
group and no distinction can be made among different categories of employees based
on their monthly salary to determine for whom the scheme shall operate in a particular
manner. It is well within the power and authority of the statutory authorities to
reasonably classify different sets of employees and categorise them for the nature of
benefits they might get from an existing scheme. In fact, the scheme, at its inception
was made applicable to those drawing wages upto Rs. 5000/- The provision relating
to exercising option was introduced later, in the year 1996.
33. On behalf of the employees, argument was also advanced against the claim of
negative financial impact on the corpus in response to the stand of the appellants that
having a large scale of beneficiaries from higher salary earners may result in remitting
asymmetrical sums from the corpus to them as pension. In this regard, learned senior
counsel for the appellants (Provident Fund Organisation and Union of India) have
made distinction between the provident fund scheme and pension scheme in their
respective operation. While provident fund scheme entails a one-time settlement in
favour of the member, the pension scheme carries, by its very nature, benefits for an
unspecified time, which has to be based on actuarial calculation. This difference has
been recognised in the judgments of this Court in the cases of Otis Elevator
report relied on by the appellants after delivery of the Kerala High Court judgment, the
net liability of the fund is projected to be Rs. 5,75,918.88/- crores for the pension
fund, exclusive of the provident fund balance that might be transferred. This
assessment has been made on 27th December 2018 and the report has been annexed
to the Rejoinder Affidavit of the appellants in the appeals arising out of SLP (C) Nos.
8658-8659 of 2019 filed on 20th March 2021 with I.A. No. 43576 of 2021 at page 410
of that document. This projection is based on assumption that every person will opt for
higher contribution and statutory salary is restored to Rs. 6500/- per month.
34. We find that the amendment was made in exercise of power otherwise vested
in the authority making such amendment and the amendments were made on the
basis of certain relevant materials and not whimsically. In this context, the scope of
judicial scrutiny to test the constitutionality of the amendment provisions becomes
narrow. This is the opinion of the Constitution Bench of this Court in the case of
employees made by the authorities on the basis of the salary drawn in the 2014
amendment meets the test of reasonable classification contemplated in Article 14 of
the Constitution of India. The newspaper report quoted in the Kerala High Court
judgment, in our opinion, would not give an effective guidance as regards position of
the pension fund and it would be prudent for the Court leave such decisions to be
made by the scheme framing body. This approach would be in line with the reasoning
of the Constitution Bench in the case of Krishena Kumar (supra). In the case of
Mafatlal Group Staff Association V. Regional Commissioner Provident Fund [(1994) 4
"10. Merely because the employees who were the members of the Employees
Provident Fund Scheme before March 1, 1971 were given an option to become or
not to become members of the Family Pension Scheme, it does not follow that the
employees who become members of the Provident Fund Scheme after March 1,
1971, and who are not given such option are discriminated against.
35. The Division Bench of the Kerala High Court, in coming to its finding that the
amendment was arbitrary, mainly relied on various economic factors. The reasoning of
the Bench was based on macroeconomic reasons like general increase in salary,
addition to the base of the fund and the negative impact on denial of pension benefits
for a large number of employees. The High Court rejected the argument based on
depletion of fund on the ground that over the years, more and more persons are
contributing to the provident fund and the corpus of the fund is growing. We are alive
to the concern expressed by the High Court as regards impact on the economic
stability of retired employees suddenly being deprived of pension. But, based on such
macro-level social disparities, we do not think in exercise of judicial power we can
require the State to operate a pension scheme in a particular manner. These factors
would be for the policy makers to examine and prescribe. We cannot issue directions
on the Central Government to work out statutory scheme in a particular fashion. So far
as fixing of cut-off date is concerned, the 2014 amendment specifically provides for
that. In the case of R.C. Gupta (supra), the wording of the scheme in paragraph 11 (3)
was different. Thus, the ratio of that judgment cannot be applied to the changed
provision of the scheme. Fixing of cut-off date was considered in the case of Mafatlal
Group Staff Association (supra) and held to be permissible. We have quoted earlier the
relevant passage from that judgment.
support of the proposition that pension is not a bounty but a right and such right
cannot be taken away retrospectively. In the context of the provisions which we are
examining in this judgment, existing members have been given option to remain in
the scheme even if their salary go beyond the ceiling limit. Thus, the right of such
members to draw pension is protected. The other area where the pension amount may
get impacted is on determination of monthly pension on the basis of altered
computation method. But this judgment is not the authority for the proposition that
pension amount cannot be altered at all. The factual basis of this judgment was that a
joint note/agreement in derogation of statutory regulations was giving retrospective
effect. It was in that context the said decision was delivered. In the cases before us,
amendment is contemplated of the scheme itself.
37. The requirement in the scheme for employee's contribution to the extent of
1.16 per cent for option members, in our opinion, is illegal. There is nothing in the
1952 Act which requires payment to the pension fund by an employee. Section 6A of
the Act also does not have any such stipulation. Since the Act does not contemplate
any contribution to be made by an employee to remain in the scheme, the Central
Government under the scheme itself cannot mandate such a stipulation. What is to be
considered here is that for the mandatory members, the Central Government
continues to contribute the requisite 1.16 per cent of their salary. For option members,
additional contribution by them is contemplated in order to remain in the scheme. In
such a situation, in our opinion, a legislative amendment of the Act would have been
necessary, providing for contribution to be made by an employee. To that extent, the
provision of the scheme requiring contribution by an individual employee is ultra vires
the parent act. At the same time, we cannot ignore the fact that the pension amount
to be paid has been calculated on projections that the corpus would include the option
-employees' additional contribution of 1.16 per cent. We also cannot mandate the
Central Government to contribute to a pension scheme, in absence of a legislative
provision to that effect. It would be for the administrators to readjust the contribution
pattern within the scope of the statute and one possible solution could be to raise the
level of the employer's contribution in the scheme. We shall, however, suspend the
operation of this part of our judgment for a period of six months so that the legislature
may consider the necessity of bringing appropriate legislative amendment on this
count. For the aforesaid period, the scheme as it stands shall continue. Till such time,
if no such legislative exercise is undertaken, the duty to contribute 1.16 per cent of
the salary shall apply on option members as well. This contribution shall be adjusted
depending on any amendment that may be brought. For the period of six months,
however, the opting employees shall make payment of 1.16 per cent contribution as
stop gap measure. In the event no amendment to the statute or the scheme is made
within such extended time, then the administrators of the fund will have to operate
the pension fund for the option members from out of the existing corpus.
38. The other aspect of the controversy involves changing the method of
computation of the pensionable salary. We have given the points and counter points
articulated by the contesting parties pertaining to this feature of the controversy
earlier in this judgment. In our opinion, this change of methodology comes within the
power of the Central Government to modify a scheme under Section 7 of the 1952 Act
read with item 10 of the Schedule III to the Act as also paragraph 32 of the scheme.
This alteration of computation is ancillary to determination of scale of pension
alongwith pensionary benefits and paragraph 32 of the pension scheme specifically
authorises the Central Government to alter the rate of contribution payable under the
Scheme or the scale of any benefit admissible under the scheme. There is a reasonable
basis for effecting change in the computation methodology for determining
pensionable salary and we do not find any illegality or unconstitutionality in effecting
this amendment.
39. We shall now address the question as to whether the members from an
exempted establishment under the 1952 Act would be entitled to the benefits of
enrolling in the scheme beyond the ceiling limit. We would point out here that before
us no argument has been advanced as regards members of the pension scheme of
exempted establishments in terms of paragraph 39 of the said scheme. Thus, in this
judgment, we are not addressing the cases of that category of members. We find from
Section 17 (A) of the Act that the investment of the provident fund for the trust fund
are also to be as per the directions of the Central Government. In quashing the circular
dated 31 Superscript(s) May 2017, the Delhi High Court has held that the employees of
unexempted establishments and exempted establishments form a homogenous group.
Section 6A of the Act also envisages coverage of employees of exempted
establishments under Section 17(6) of the Act within the pension scheme. Section 17
(6) of the Act stipulates:
"(6) Subject to the provisions of sub-section [(1C)] the employer of an exempted
establishment or of an exempted employee of an establishment to which the
provisions of the [Pension] Scheme apply, shall, notwithstanding any exemption
granted under sub-section (1) or sub-section (2), pay to the [Pension] Fund such
portion of the employer's contribution to its provident fund within such time and in
such manner as may be specified in the [Pension] Scheme."
40. Further, Clause (3) of the pension scheme contemplates keeping within its
fold the establishments to which the 1952 Act applies. These establishments would
include exempted establishments as well. The employees of exempted establishments
are integrated into the pension scheme and we are of the opinion that the employees
of an exempted establishment should not be deprived of the benefit of getting option
to remain in the pension scheme while drawing salary beyond the ceiling limit, in
situations where similarly situated employees of unexempted establishments can
exercise such option. In the event the scheme is construed in a way which would
exclude them, that would lead to artificial classification of otherwise same categories
of employees. Thus, the pension scheme ought to apply to the employees of the
exempted establishments in the same manner as this scheme applies to the
employees of unexempted or regular establishments.
41. One of the arguments against their inclusion into the scheme by exercising
option is that the corpus of the contribution for exempted establishments have been
kept in separate coffers maintained by the trust created for such purpose and not with
the authorities specified under the Act. Taking that factor into account, we are of the
view that in order to be entitled to the benefits of the pension fund, the employer and
the employee, simultaneously with exercising option in terms of the order of this
Court, shall also have to give an undertaking of transferring the employers'
contribution at the stipulated rate maintained by the trusts, which shall be equivalent
to and not lower than the sum which would have been transferable, had such fund
been maintained by the provident fund authorities. Such transfer shall take place,
immediately after exercise of such option, within such period as may be directed by
the administrators of the pension fund.
42. We shall now deal with argument of the appellants that no vested legal right of
the employees has been encroached upon by the 2014 amendment. For this purpose,
amended paragraph 11 (4) needs to be analysed. The said paragraph (4) provides
for extending the pension coverage in respect of individual employees drawing salary
more than Rs. 15000/- per month. This paragraph however, is subject to two
conditions:
(i) The first one is that to be eligible for the benefits of extended coverage, the
existing members as on 1 st September 2014 must contribute at the rate of 1.16
per cent on salary exceeding Rs. 15,000/- per month.
ii) The second one is that a fresh option should be exercised within a period of six
months from the first day of September 2014. The scheme contemplates that
those members of the fund who had exercised option to remain in the scheme as
per the requirement of proviso to paragraph 11(3) of the scheme, as it stood
prior to the 2014 amendment, would be able to give fresh option with the
employer if their salary cross the ceiling limit. In respect of that provision, this
Court in the Case of R.C. Gupta (supra) had held that the said proviso did not
contemplate a cut-off date.
43. So far as the first condition is concerned, we have expressed our views earlier in
this judgment as regards legality of having such a provision. In relation to the second
condition, our opinion is that the eligibility for enhancement cannot be restricted to
those employees only who had exercised the option to remain in the scheme once
their salary went beyond the capping of Rs. 6500/- per month. As we have already
discussed, in case of R.C. Gupta (supra), it has been specifically held that there was
no cut-off date in proviso to paragraph 11 (3) as it stood before the 2014 amendment.
In our opinion, the interpretation given to the proviso to paragraph 11 (3) prior to 2014
amendment does not require any reconsideration. We agree with the reasoning of the
two-judge Bench of this Court on this point, as expressed in the said judgment. As
there was no cut-off date to be contemplated prior to the 2014 amendment, limiting
the entitlement of enhanced pension coverage to those employees only who had
already exercised an option under Clause 11 (3) of the unamended scheme would be
contrary to the ratio of the decision of this Court held in the case of R.C. Gupta
(supra). We are not holding that no option was required to be exercised as per proviso
to paragraph (3) of the scheme, as it stood prior to 2014 amendment. As held in
the case of R.C. Gupta (supra), there was no time-limit for exercising such option.
44. The dual option, as is contemplated in paragraph 11(4) of the pension scheme
(post 2014 amendment), has to be merged into one. In the event the employer and
employee jointly opt for coverage beyond the salary limit of Rs. 15000/-, without
giving an earlier option under the unamended Clause 11 (3) of the pension scheme,
they would not be automatically excluded from their right to exercise option under
paragraph 11 1(4) of the scheme, post amendment.
45. The other condition for enhanced coverage relates to the date within which such
fresh option is to be exercised by a member, which is stipulated to be within a period
of six months from st September 2014. It would be legitimate to proceed on the basis
that several members did not exercise such option earlier because of the stand taken
by the Provident Fund authorities that option under proviso to paragraph 11 (3) of the
scheme (prior to 2014 amendment) has to be exercised within a specified date, which
stand was negated in the decision of R.C. Gupta (supra). We are of the view that the
time limit for coverage beyond the ceiling amount should be extended by a further
period of four months from today to enable all the members of the pension fund
drawing more than Rs. 6500/- to exercise the joint option as contemplated in
paragraph 11 (4) of the pension scheme (post 2014 amendment). Once such joint
option is exercised, the transfer of fund from the provident fund corpus to the pension
fund shall be effected in terms of the scheme.
46. We accordingly hold and direct:-
(i) The provisions contained in the notification no. G.S.R. 09(E) dated 22nd August
2014 are legal and valid. So far as present members of the fund are concerned,
we have read down certain provisions of the scheme as applicable in their cases
and we shall give our findings and directions on these provisions in the
subsequent sub-paragraphs.
(ii) Amendment to the pension scheme brought about by the notification no. G.S.R.
609(E) dated 22 August 2014 shall apply to the employees of the exempted
establishments in the same manner as the employees of the regular
establishments. Transfer of funds from the exempted establishments shall be in
the manner as we have already directed.
(iii) The employees who had exercised option under the proviso to paragraph 11 (3)
of the 1995 scheme and continued to be in service as on 1st September 2014,
will be guided by the amended provisions of paragraph (4) of the pension
scheme.
(iv) The members of the scheme, who did not exercise option, as contemplated in
the proviso to paragraph (3) of the pension scheme (as it was before the 2014
Amendment) would be entitled to exercise option under paragraph 11 (4) of the
post amendment scheme. Their right to exercise option before 1 st September
2014 stands crystalised in the judgment of this Court in the case of R.C. Gupta
(supra). The scheme as it stood before st September 2014 did not provide for
any cutoff date and thus those members shall be entitled to exercise option in
terms of paragraph11 (4) of the scheme, as it stands at present. Their exercise of
option shall be in the nature of joint options covering pre-amended paragraph 11
(3) as also the amended paragraph 11(4) of the pension scheme.
There was uncertainty as regards validity of the post amendment scheme, which
was quashed by the aforesaid judgments of the three High Courts. Thus, all the
employees who did not exercise option but were entitled to do so but could not due
to the interpretation on cut-off date by the authorities, ought to be given a further
chance to exercise their option. Time to exercise option under paragraph 11 (4) of
the scheme, under these circumstances, shall stand extended by a further period of
four months. We are giving this direction in exercise of our jurisdiction under Article
142 of the Constitution of India.
Rest of the requirements as per the amended provision shall be complied with.
(v) The employees who had retired prior to September 2014 without exercising
any option under paragraph 11 (3) of the pre-amendment scheme have already
exited from the membership thereof. They would not be entitled to the benefit of
this judgment.
(vi) The employees who have retired before 1 st September 2014 upon exercising
option under paragraph 11 (3) of the 1995 scheme shall be covered by the
provisions of the paragraph 11 (3) of the pension scheme as it stood prior to the
amendment of 2014.
(vii) The requirement of the members to contribute at the rate of 1.16 per cent of
their salary to the extent such salary exceeds Rs. 15000/- per month as an
additional contribution under the amended scheme is held to be ultra vires the
provisions of the 1952 Act. But for the reasons already explained above, we
suspend operation of this part of our order for a period of six months. We do so
to enable the authorities to make adjustments in the scheme so that the
additional contribution can be generated from some other legitimate source
within the scope of the Act, which could include enhancing the rate of
contribution of the employers. We are not speculating on what steps the
authorities will take as it would be for the legislature or the framers of the
scheme to make necessary amendment. For the aforesaid period of six months or
till such time any amendment is made, whichever is earlier, the employees'
contribution shall be as stop gap measure. The said sum shall be adjustable on
the basis of alteration to the scheme that may be made.
(viii) We do not find any flaw in altering the basis for computation of pensionable
salary.
(ix) We agree with the view taken by the Division Bench in the case of R.C. Gupta
(supra) so far as interpretation of the proviso to paragraph 11(3) (pre-
amendment) pension scheme is concerned. The fund authorities shall implement
the directives contained in the said judgment within a period of eight weeks,
subject to our directions contained earlier in this paragraph.
(x) The Contempt Petition (C) Nos. 1917-1918 of 2018 and Contempt Petition (C)
Nos. 619-620 of 2019 in Civil Appeal Nos. 10013-10014 of 2016 are disposed of
in the above terms.
47. All the appeals which we have heard simultaneously are allowed in the above
terms and the judgments impugned are modified accordingly. The writ petitions
brought by employees or their representatives shall also stand disposed of in the same
terms.
48. Pending application(s), if any, shall also stand disposed of.
49. There shall be no order as to costs.
