Preface
1. In the present batch of petition(s)/appeal(s)/case(s), we are called upon to deal with the
pleas concerning validity and interpretation of certain provisions of the Prevention of Money-
Laundering Act, 2002* and the procedure followed by the Enforcement Directorate** while
inquiring into/ investigating offences under the PMLA, being violative of the constitutional mandate.
(a) It is relevant to mention at the outset that after the decision of this court in Nikesh
Tarachand Shah V. Union of India***, Parliament amended section 45 of the 2002 Act vide Act
13 of 2018, so as to remove the defect noted in the said decision and to revive the effect of twin
conditions specified in section 45 to offences under the 2002 Act. This amendment came to be
challenged before different High Courts including this court by way of writ petitions. In some
cases where relief of bail was prayed, the efficacy of amended section 45 of the 2002 Act was
put in issue and answered by the concerned High Court. Those decision(s) have been assailed
before this
* For short, "PMLA" or "the 2002 Act".
For short, "ED".
court and the same is forming part of this batch of cases. At the same time, separate writ
petitions have been filed to challenge several other provisions of the 2002 Act and all those
cases have been tagged and heard together as overlapping issues have been raised by the
parties.
(b) We have various other civil and criminal writ petitions, appeals, special leave petitions,
transferred petitions and transferred cases before us, raising similar questions of law pertaining
to constitutional validity and interpretation of certain provisions of the other statutes including
the Customs Act, 1962*, the Central Goods and Services tax Act, 2017** the Companies Act,
2013***, the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988#, the Indian Penal Code, 1860## and the
Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973## which are also under challenge. However, we are
confining ourselves only with challenge to the provisions of the PMLA.
(c) As aforementioned, besides challenge to constitutional validity and interpretation of
provisions under the PMLA, there are special leave petitions filed against various orders of High
Courts/subordinate courts across the country, whereby prayer for grant of
bail/quashing/discharge stood rejected, as also, special leave petitions concerned with issues
other than constitutional validity and interpretation. Union of India has also filed appeals/special
leave petitions ; and there are few transfer petitions filed under article 139A(1) of the
Constitution of India.
(d) Instead of dealing with facts and issues in each case, we will be confining ourselves to
examining the challenge to the relevant provisions of the PMLA, being question of law raised by
parties.
Submissions of the private parties
2. Mr. Kapil Sibal, learned senior counsel appearing for the private parties/ petitioners in the
concerned matter(s) submitted that the procedure followed by the ED in registering the
Enforcement Case Information Report*# is opaque, arbitrary and violative of the constitutional
rights of an accused. It was submitted that the procedure being followed under the PMLA is
draconian as it violates the basic tenets of the criminal justice system and the rights enshrined in
Part III of the Constitution of India, in particular articles 14, 20 and 21 thereof.
* For short, "1962 Act" or "the Customs Act".
For short, "CGST Act".
For short, "Companies Act".
# For short, "PC Act".
# # For short, "IPC".
For short, "Cr.P.C. or "the 1973 Code".
For short, "ECIR".
(i) A question was raised as to whether there can be a procedure in law, where penal
proceedings can be started against an individual, without informing him of the charges ? It was
contended that as per present situation, the ED can arrest an individual on the basis of an ECIR
without informing him of its contents, which is per se arbitrary and violative of the constitutional
rights of an accused. The right of an accused to get a copy of the First Information Report* at an
early stage and also the right to know the allegations as an inherent part of article 21. Reference
was made to Youth Bar Association of India V. Union of India** in support of this plea. Further,
as per law, the agencies investigating crimes need to provide a list of all the documents and
materials seized to the accused in order to be consistent with the principles of transparency and
openness** It was also submitted that under the Cr.P.C., every FIR registered by an officer
under section 154 thereof is to be forwarded to the jurisdictional Magistrate. However, this
procedure is not being followed in ECIR cases. Further, violation of section 157 of the Cr.P.C. was
also alleged and it was submitted that this has led to non-compliance with the procedure
prescribed under the law (Cr.P.C.) and the law laid down by this court in catena of decisions. It
was vehemently argued that in some cases the ECIR is voluntarily provided, while in others it is
not, which is completely arbitrary and discriminatory.
The surest way legal research!"
(ii) It was argued that as per definition of section 3 of the PMLA, the accused can either
directly or indirectly commit money-laundering if he is connected by way of any process or
activity with the proceeds of crime and has projected or claimed such proceeds as untainted
property. In light of this, it was suggested that the investigation may shed some light on such
alleged proceeds of crime, for which, facts must first be collected and there should be a
definitive determination whether such proceeds of crime have actually been generated from the
scheduled offence. Thus, there must be at least a prima facie quantification to ensure that the
threshold of the PMLA is met and it cannot be urged that the ECIR is an internal document.
Therefore, in the absence of adherence to the requirements of the Cr.P.C. and the procedure
established by law, these are being violated blatantly#.
(iii) An anomalous situation is created where based on such ECIR, the ED can summon
accused persons and seek details of financial transactions.
* A For short, "FIR".
4309 (paras 39 and 54).
The accused is summoned under section 50 of the PMLA to make such statements which are
treated as admissible in evidence. Throughout the process, the accused might well be unaware
of the allegations against him. It is clear that Cr.P.C. has separate provisions for summoning of
the accused under section 41A and for witnesses under section 160. The same distinction is
absent under the PMLA. Further, Chapter XII of the Cr.P.C. is not being followed by the ED and,
as such, there are no governing principles of investigation, no legal criteria and guiding
principles which are required to be followed. As such, the initiation of investigation by the ED,
which can potentially curtail the liberty of the individual, would suffer from the vice of article 14
of the Constitution of India*,
(iv) Mr. Sibal, while referring to the definition of "money-laundering" under section 3 of the
PMLA, submitted that the ED must satisfy itself that the proceeds of crime have been projected
as untainted property for the registration of an ECIR or the application of the PMLA. It has been
vehemently argued that the offence of money-laundering requires the proceeds of crime to be
mandatorily 'projected or claimed' as 'untainted property'. Meaning thereby that section 3 is
applicable only to the generation of proceeds of crime, such proceeds being projected or claimed
as untainted property. It is stated that the pertinent condition of 'and' projecting or claiming
cannot be ousted and made or interpreted to be 'or' by the Explanation that has been brought
about by way of the amendment made vide Finance (No. 2) Act, 2019. It has been submitted
that such an act would also be unconstitutional, as being enlarging the ambit of a principal
section by way of adding an Explanation.
(v) It is also stated that the general practice is that the ED registers an ECIR immediately
upon an FIR of a predicate offence being registered. The cause of action being entirely different
from the predicate offence, as such, can lead to a situation where there is no difference between
the predicate offence and money-laundering. In support of the said argument, reliance was
placed on article 3 of the Vienna Convention** where words like "conversion or transfer of
property", "for the purpose of concealing or disguising the illicit origin of the property or of
assisting any person who is involved in the commission of such an offence or offences to evade
the legal consequences of his actions", have been used. It is urged that what was sought to be
criminalised was not the mere acquisition and use of pro

Psychotropic Substances (hereinafter referred to as "Vienna Convention" or "the 1988 Convention"
or "the UN Drugs Convention", as the case may be).
ceeds of crime, but it was the conversion or transfer for the purpose of either concealing or
disguising the illicit origin of the property to evade the legal consequences of one's actions.
Reference was also made to the Preamble of the PMLA which refers to India's global
commitments to combat the menace of money-laundering. The learned counsel has then
referred to the definition of "money-laundering" as per the Prevention of Money- Laundering Bill,
1999* to show how upon reference to the Select Committee of the Rajya Sabha, certain
observations were made and, hence, the amendment was effected, wherein the words "and
projecting it as untainted property" were added to the definition which was finally passed in the
form of the PMLA. We have reproduced the relevant sections/provisions hereinbelow at the
appropriate place. Reliance has also been placed on the decision of Nikesh Tarachand Shah
(supra).
(vi) The safeguard provided by section 173 of the Cr.P.C., it is argued, was present in the
original enactment of 2002 (PMLA). The same has now supposedly been whittled down by
various amendments over the years. It has been submitted that by way of amendments in 2009,
proviso have been added to sections 5 and 17, which have diluted certain safeguards. Further, it
is submitted that the safeguard under section 17(1) has been totally done away within the
amendment made in 2019. To further this argument, it has been suggested that the filing of
charge-sheet in respect of a predicate offence was impliedly there in section 19 of the PMLA,
since there is a requirement which cannot be fulfilled sans an investigation, to record reasons to
believe that 'any person has been guilty of an offence punishable under this Act'. In respect of
section 50, it is urged that though there is no threshold mentioned in the Act, yet the persons
concerned should be summoned only after the registration of the ECIR. It is, thus, submitted
that any attempt to prosecute under the PMLA without prima facie recordings would be
inconsistent with the Act itself and violative of the fundamental rights.
(vii) It is urged that the derivate Act cannot be more onerous than the original. It is
suggested that the proceeds of crime and the predicate offence are entwined inextricably.
Further, the punishment for generation of the proceeds of crime cannot be disproportionate to
the punishment for the underlying predicate offence. The same analogy ought to apply to the
procedural protections, such as those provided under section 41A of the Cr.P.C., which otherwise
would be foul of the constitutional protections under article 21.
* For short, "1999 Bill".
(viii) The learned counsel has also challenged the aspect of the Schedule being overbroad and
inconsistent with the PMLA and the predicate offences. It is argued that even in the Statements
of Objects and Reasons of the 1999 Bill, it has been stated that the Act was brought in to curb
the laundering stemming from trade in narcotics and drug related crimes. Reference is also
made to the various conventions that are part of the jurisprudence behind the PMLA*. It was to
be seen in light of organised crime, unlike its application today to less heinous crimes such as
theft. It is submitted that there was no intention or purpose to cover offences under the PMLA so
widely. It is also submitted that there are certain offences which are less severe and heinous
than money-laundering itself and that the inclusion of such offences in the Schedule does not
have a rational nexus with the objects and reasons of the PMLA and the same is unreasonable,
arbitrary and violative of articles 14 and 21 of the Constitution of India.
(ix) It has been submitted that the PMLA cannot be a standalone statute. To bolster this
claim, reliance has been placed on speeches made by Ministers in Parliament. Further reliance
has been placed on K. P. Varghese V. ITO* Union of India V. Martin Lottery Agencies Ltd.
and P. Chidambaram V. Directorate of Enforcement#.
(x) Our attention is also drawn to the provisions which have now been replaced in the statute.
Prior to 2013 amendment, section 8(5) of the PMLA was to the following effect :-
"8. Adjudication.
(5) Whereon conclusion of a trial for any scheduled offence, the person concerned is
acquitted, the attachment of the property or retention of the seized property or record under sub
-section (3) and net income, if any, shall cease to have effect."
However, vide amendment in 2013, the words 'trial for any scheduled offence' were replaced
with the words 'trial of an offence under this Act'. It is urged that for the property to qualify as
proceeds of crime, it must be connected in some way with the activity related to the scheduled
offence.

Declaration and Global Program of Action adopted by the United Nations General Assembly on
23.02.1990 ; and Resolution passed at the UN Special Session on countering World Drug Problem
Together, 8th to 10th June 1998.
Meaning thereby that if there is no scheduled offence, there can be no property derived
directly or indirectly; thus, an irrefutable conclusion that a scheduled offence is a pre-requisite
for generation of proceeds of crime.
(xi) It is further argued that an Explanation has been added to section 44(1)(d) of the PMLA
by way of the Finance (No. 2) Act, 2019, which posits that a trial under the PMLA can proceed
independent of the trial of scheduled offence. It is submitted that the Explanation is being given
a mischievous interpretation when it ought to be read plainly and simply. It is stated that the
Explanation relates only to the Special Court and not the trial of the scheduled offence. It is
submitted that a Special Court can never convict a person under the PMLA without returning a
finding that a scheduled offence has been committed.
(xii) It is submitted that the application of Cr.P.C. is necessary since it is a procedure
established by law and there cannot be an investigation outside the purview of section 154 or
155 of the Cr.P.C. Reference is made to the constitutional safeguards of reasonability and
fairness. It is submitted that the Act itself, under section 65, provides for the applicability of the
Cr.P.C.* It is pointed out that several safeguards, procedural in nature are being violated. To
illustrate a few - non registration of FIR, lack of a case diary, restricted access to the ECIR,
violation of section 161 of the Cr.P.C., section 41A of the Cr.P.C., lack of magisterial permission
under section 155 of the Cr.P.C. Such unguided use of power to investigate and prosecute any
person violates articles 14 and 21 of the Constitution.
(xiii) Another argument raised by the learned counsel is that the ED officers are police
officers. It is submitted that the determination of the same depends on: (1) what is the object
and purpose of the special statute and (2) the nature of power exercised by such officers ? The
first argument in this regard is that if it can be shown that in order to achieve the objectives of
the special statute-preventive and detection steps to curb crime are permitted and coercive
powers are vested, then such an officer is a police officer. Further, such an officer is covered
within the ambit of sections 25 and 26 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872**. In support of the
test to gauge the objective of the statute, reference has been made to State of Punjab V. Barkat
Ram** wherein it was held .a customs officer is not a police officer within the meaning of
section 25 of the 1872 Act. It is also

For short, "the 1872 Act" or "the Evidence Act".
(para 88).
stated that police officers had to be construed not in a narrow way but in a wide and popular
sense. Reference is made to sections 17 and 18 of the Police Act, 1861*, whereunder an
appointment of special police officers can be made. Thus, it is stated that it is not necessary to
be enrolled under the 1861 Act, but if one is invested with the same powers i.e., the powers for
prevention and detection of crime, one will be a police officer. Then, the PMLA is distinguished
from the 1962 Act, Sea Customs Act, 1878**, Central Excise Act, 1944*** and the CGST Act.
The dissenting opinion of Subba Rao, J. in Barkat Ram (supra) is also relied upon. Thereafter, it
is stated that the PMLA, being a purely penal statute, one needs to look at the Statement of
Objects and Reasons of the 1999 Bill and the Financial Action Task Force# recommendations.
(xiv) Reliance was also placed on Raja Ram Jaiswal V. State of Bihar##. Further, it has been
stated that even in Tofan Singh V. State of Tamil Nadu### the case of Raja Ram Jaiswal
(supra) has been relied upon and it is concluded that when a person is vested with the powers of
investigation, he is said to be a police officer, as he prevents and detects crime. Further, the
powers under section 50 of the PMLA for the purpose of investigation are in consonance with
what has been held in Tofan Singh (supra) and establishes a direct relationship with the
prohibition under section 25 of the 1872 Act. Another crucial point raised is that most statutes
where officers have not passed the muster of 'police officers' in the eyes of law, contain the term
"enquiry" in contrast with the term "investigation" used in section 50 of the PMLA. A parallel has
also been drawn between the definition of "investigation" under the PMLA in section 2(1)(na)
and section 2(h) of the Cr.P.C. Further, it is urged that the test of power to file 'chargesheet' is
not determinative of being a police officer.
(xv) It is then urged that section 44(1)(b) of the PMLA stipulates that cognizance can be
taken only on a complaint being made by the Authority under the PMLA. Whereas, in originally
enacted section 44(1)(b), both the conditions i. e., 'filing of a police report', as well as, 'a
complaint made by an authority" were covered. The learned counsel also reminisces of the
speech of the then Finance Minister on the Prevention of Money-Laundering (Amendment) Bill,
2005*# in the Lok Sabha on May 6, 2005.

However, it was also conceded that the amendment of section 44(1)(b) of the PMLA removed
the words, "upon perusal of police report of the facts which constitute an offence under this Act
or". Next amendment made was insertion of section 45(1A) and section 73(2)(ua), by which the
right of police officers to investigate the offence under section 3 was restricted unless authorised
by the Central Government by way of a general or special authorisation. Further amendment was
deletion of section 45(1)(a) of the PMLA, making the offence of money-laundering under the
PMLA a non-cognizable offence. Further, it is submitted that amendment to section 44(1)(b) has
been made as a consequence for making the offence under the PMLA non-cognizable. It is stated
that even today if investigation is done by a police officer or another, he can only file a complaint
and not a police report. Therefore, the above-mentioned test is irrelevant and inapplicable.
Absurdity that arises is due to two investigations being conducted, one by a police officer and
the other by the authorities specified under section 48. An additional point has been raised that
the difference between a complaint under the PMLA and a chargesheet under the Cr.P.C. is only
a nomenclature norm and they are essentially the same thing. Thus, basing the determination of
whether one is a police officer or not, on the nomenclature, is not proper.
(xvi) In respect of interpretation and constitutionality of section 50 of the PMLA, our attention
is drawn to section 50(2) which pertains to recording of statement of a person summoned during
the course of an investigation. In that, section 50(3) posits that such person needs to state the
truth. Further, he has to sign such statement and suffer the consequences for incorrect version
under section 63(2)(b) ; and the threat of penalty under section 63(2) or arrest under section
19.
(xvii) It is urged that in comparison to the constitutional law, the Cr.P.C. and the 1872 Act,
the provisions under the PMLA are draconian and, thus, violative of articles 20(3) and 21 of the
Constitution. Our attention is drawn to section 160 of the Cr.P.C. when person is summoned as a
witness or under section 41A as an accused or a suspect. In either case, the statement is
recorded as per section 161 of the Cr.P.C. Safeguards have been inserted by this court in
Nandini Satpathy V. P. L. Dani*, while also the protection under section 161(2) is relied on.
Thus, based on sections 161 and 162, it is submitted that such evidence is inadmissible in the
trial of an offence, unless it is used only for the purpose of contradiction as stipulated in section
145 of the 1872 Act. Further, it is stated that proof of contradiction is materially different from
and does not amount to the proof of
the matter asserted* and can only be used to cast doubt or discredit the testimony of the
witness who is testifying before court**. The legislative intent behind section 162 of the Cr.P.C.
is also relied upon, as has been held in Tahsildar Singh V. State of U. P. (supra).
(xviii) It is, therefore, urged that the current practice of the ED is such that it violates all
these statutory and constitutional protections by implicating an accused by procuring signed
statements under threat of legal penalty. The protection under section 25 of the 1872 Act is also
pressed into service.
(xix) To make good the point, the learned counsel proceeded to delineate the legislative
history of section 25 of the 1872 Act. He referred to the first report of the Law Commission of
India and the Cr.P.C., which was based on gross abuse of power by police officers for extracting
confessions.
Further, this protection was transplanted into the 1872 Act#, where on the
presumption that a confession made to a police officer was obtained through force or coercion
was fortified# #. It was pointed out that recommendations of three Law Commissions 14th, 48th
and 69th which advocated for allowance of such confessions to be admissible, were vehemently
rejected in the 185th Law Commission Report. Thus, relying on Raja Ram Jaiswal (supra) where
a substantial link between section 25 of the 1872 Act, police officer and confession has been
settled. Therefore, the present situation where prosecution can be mounted under section 63 for
failing to give such confessions is said to be contrary to procedure established by law interlinked
with the right to a fair trial under article 21. Reliance has also been placed on Selvi V. State of
Karnataka## the 180th Law Commission Report and section 313 of the Cr.P.C. as being
subsidiaries of right against self-incrimination and right to silence, not being read against him.
(xx) The learned counsel then delineated on the preconditions for protection of article 20(3).
First, the person standing in the character of an accused, as laid down in State of Bombay V.
Kathi Kalu Oghad* #, has been referred to. In this regard, it is submitted that the term may be
given a wide connotation and an inclusion in the FIR, ECIR, chargesheet or complaint is

not necessary and can be availed of even by suspects at the time of interrogation. It is urged
that both the position of law stands clarified in Nandini Satpathy (supra) and Selvi (supra). even
to the extent where answering certain questions can incriminate a person in other offences or
where links are furnished in chain of evidence required for prosecution. It is then urged that the
expression 'shall be compelled' is not restricted to physical state, but also mental state of mind
and it is argued that nevertheless a broad interpretation must be given to the circumstances in
which a person can be so compelled for recording of statement. Additionally, the term 'to be a
witness' would take within its fold 'to appear as a witness' and it is said that it must encompass
protection even outside court in investigations conducted by authorities such as the ED*. It was
also argued that this protection should extend beyond statements that are confession, such as
incriminating statements which would furnish a link in the chain of evidence against the person.
(xxi) It is submitted that the test which this court ought to consider for determination of the
vires of section 50 of the PMLA is : whether a police officer is in a position to compel a person to
render a confession giving incriminating statement against himself under threat of legal sanction
and arrest ? It is further pointed out that the ED as a matter of course records statement even
when the accused person is in custody. In some circumstances, a person is not even informed of
the capacity in which he/she is being summoned. What makes it worse is the fact that the ED
claims the non-application of Chapter XII of the Cr.P.C. It does not register FIR and keeps the
ECIR as an internal document. All the abovementioned circumstances are said to render the
questioning by the ED, which might not be restricted to the offence of money-laundering alone,
as a testimonial compulsion** Hence, advocating the protection of article 20(3) of the
Constitution, it is submitted that all safeguards and protections are rendered illusionary.
(xxii) Finally, an argument is raised that section 50 of the PMLA is much worse than section
67 of the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substance Act, 1985***. Further, the NDPS Act is the
underlying reason for the PMLA and this court in Tofan Singh (supra), in no uncertain terms, has

given protection in respect of confessional statement even in the NDPS Act. The much harder
and harsher punishment of death in the NDPS Act is also contrasted against the PMLA. It is also
submitted that constitutional safeguards cannot be undermined by the usage of the term
"judicial proceedings". The term has been defined in section 2(i) of the Cr.P.C. which includes
any proceeding in the course of which evidence is or may be legally "taken on oath"* Section 50
(1) has been distinguished for being in respect of only section 13 of the PMLA. It is also
submitted that the enforcement authority is not deemed to be a civil court ; it can be easily
concluded that an investigation done by the enforcement authority is not a judicial proceeding
and section 50 of the PMLA falls foul of the constitutional safeguards.
(xxiii) Pertinently, arguments have also been advanced in respect of the implication of laws
relating to money bills and their application to the Amendment Acts to the PMLA. However, at
the outset, we had mentioned that this issue is not a part of the ongoing discourse in this matter
and we refrain from referring to the arguments raised in that regard.
3. Next submissions were advanced by Mr. Sidharth Luthra, learned senior counsel on the same
lines. He argued that the current procedure envisaged under the PMLA is violative of article 21 of
the Constitution of India. The procedure established by law has to be in the form of a statute or
delegated legislation and pass the muster of the constitutional protections. The Cr.P.C. has
several safeguards in respect of arrested investigation ; they are also rooted in the Cr.P.C. of 1898.
They are reflective of the constitutional protections. The manual, circulars, guidelines of the ED are
executive in nature and as such, cannot be used for the curtailment of an individual liberty. Under
the PMLA, there is no visible sign of these protections against police's power of search and arrest; it
is in stark contrast with the constitutional protections given also the reverse presumption against
innocence at stage of bail under section 45 of the PMLA. Further, the destruction of the
presumption of innocence under sections 22, 23 and 45 cannot even meet the test at the pre-
complaint and pre-cognizance stage*** and the accused cannot escape the rigors of custody as per
section 167 of the Cr.P.C. As such, these conditions of reverse burden are in violation of articles 14
and 21 of the Constitution. Presumption of innocence even in the
(paras 1, 2, 10).
and 21).
pre-constitutional era has been a part of the right to a fair trial.* After the Constitution came into
existence, it has formed a part of a human right and procedure established by law. Lack of
oversight in an investigation under the PMLA is said to be in gross violation of justice, fairness and
reasonableness. It is also pointed out that while the predicate offence might be investigated,
protected under the garb of the Cr.P.C., the non-application of such safeguards under the PMLA is
wholly unjustified.
The procedure as envisaged under the PMLA, especially under section
17,
vests the executive with the supervisory power in an investigation. The same is anathema to the
rule of law and the magisterial supervision of an investigation is an integral part and is a necessity
for ensuring free and fair investigation. #
(i) It is further submitted that not supplying of the ECIR to the accused is in gross violation of
article 21 of the Constitution, the ECIR being equivalent to an FIR instituted by the ED. It
contains the grounds of arrest, details of the offences ; and as such, without the knowledge of
the ingredients of such a document the ability of the accused to defend himself at the stage of
bail cannot be fully realized. It may also hamper the ability to prepare for the trial at a later
stage# #. Further, it is submitted that even under the 1962 Act and the Foreign Exchange
Regulation Act, 1973###, section 167 of the Cr.P.C. has been held to be applicable and also
found to be a human right*# Further, it is argued that there is no rational basis for a search or
a seizure to be reported to the Adjudicating Authority, as they have no control. Further, the
PMLA has two sets of processes for attachment and confiscation which is subject to final
determination. Hence, lack of judicial oversight is irrational, as attachment is a step-in aid for
final adjudication. In absence of safeguards and supply of ECIR, a fair investigation is not a
statutory obligation. This is contrary to the Constitution and the Cr.P.C. Further, it is submitted
that personal liberty under article 21 cannot be curtailed as the ED manuals, circulars and
guidelines are administrative directions and cannot be regarded as law under article 13 of the
Constitution. Such restrictions on personal liberty based on administrative
* Attygalle V. King, AIR 1936 PC 169.

For short, "FERA".
directions are neither reasonable restrictions nor law under articles 13 and 19(2) of the
Constitution. Reliance has been placed on a plethora of cases, such as Bidi Supply Co. V. Union
of India*, Collector of Malabar V. Erimmal Ebrahim Hajee**, G. J. Fernandez V. State of
Mysore** and Bijoe Emmanuel V. State of Kerala# to show that the inapplicability of Chapter
XII of the Cr.P.C. cannot be countenanced.
(ii) It is also argued that the PMLA has inadequate safeguards for guaranteeing a fair
investigation. For, there are no safeguards akin to sections 41 to 41D, 46, 49, 50, 51, 55, 55A,
58, 60A of the Cr.P.C. Under Chapters V and VII of the PMLA, safeguards are limited to sections
16 to 19 and 50. The onerous bail conditions under section 45 are in the nature of jurisdiction of
suspicion that is preventive detention under article 22(3) to 22(7), which in itself has various
safeguards which are absent in the PMLA. Further, post 2019 amendment, making money-
laundering a cognizable and non-bailable offence, there are no more checks and balances
present against the exercise of discretion by the ED. Magisterial oversight has been revoked
;
also, supervision envisaged under section 17 is that of the executive which is against the rule of
law and right of fair trial## It is also stated that under the current scheme, an accused will be
subject to two different procedures which is under the predicate offence and under the PMLA. To
illustrate, sections 410 and 411 of the IPC are scheduled offences overlapping with sections 3
and 4 of the PMLA. However, the safeguards provided are nowhere uniform. The same is
unreasonable and manifestly arbitrary### It is also to be noted that the PMLA does not
expressly exclude the application of Chapter XII of the Cr.P.C. and as such, ambiguity must be
interpreted in a way that protects fundamental rights of the people*#.
(iii) The next leg of the argument is to the effect that subsequent amendment cannot revive
section 45, which was struck down as unconstitutional by the decision in Nikesh Tarachand Shah
(supra). The same could have not been revived by the 2018 and 2019 amendments. A provision
or a statute held to be unconstitutional must be considered stillborn

and void, and it cannot be brought back to life by a subsequent amendment that seeks to
remove the constitutional objection. It must be imperatively re-enacted*. Further, even in
arguendo, the twin conditions are manifestly arbitrary as it is against the basic criminal law
jurisprudence of the right of presumption of innocence. This right has been recognised under
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights**, as well as, by this court in Babu V. State
of Kerala It is also contended that subjecting an accused person not arrested during
investigation to onerous bail conditions under section 45 is contrary to the decision of this
court#. It was urged that even other statutes have such twin conditions for bail such as the
Terrorist and Disruptive Activities (Prevention) Act, 1987## the Maharashtra Control of
Organised Crime Act, 1999### and the NDPS Act. However, it is pointed out that it has been
held that such onerous conditions were necessary only in certain kinds of cases-for example,
terrorist offences, which are clearly a distinct and incompatible offence in the face of PMLA.
Further, it is argued that even under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967*#, the court
has to examine only whether the allegation is prima facie true while granting bail, but in case of
PMLA, the court has to reach a finding that there are reasonable grounds for believing that the
accused is not guilty before granting bail. Thus, as soon as charges are framed, a person is
disentitled to apply for bail as prima facie case is made out, which helps in achieving the
purpose of preventive detention without procedure established by law# Further, these deep
restrictive conditions even under the UAPA and the NDPS Act are restricted only to parts of these
Acts and not to the whole of them. However, the same is not the case under the PMLA, as it is
applicable to all predicate offences. Such an approach ignores crucial distinctions such as nature,
gravity and punishment of different offences in the Schedule of PMLA and treats unequals as
equals. This is in violation of article 14 of the Constitution of India. Reliance is also placed on
United States V. Anthony Salerno*#*, where restrictive bail provisions are permitted in pre-trial
detention because of the presence of
* Saghir Ahmad V. State of U. P., AIR 1954 SC 728 (para 23) ; also see : Deep Chand V. State of

detailed procedural safeguards. Still, it is argued, that such restrictive bail provisions cannot
oust the ability of Constitutional Court to grant bail on the ground of violation of Part III of the
Constitution*. Further, it has been held that Magistrate must ensure that frivolous prosecution is
weeded out. Provisions such as sections 21, 22, 23 and 45 of the PMLA reverse the burden and
curtail the jurisdiction of the trial court arbitrarily in violation of the findings of this court**.
Thus, various counts that have been argued herein point out that the PMLA suffers from manifest
arbitrariness in light of Shayara Bano V. Union of India*** and Joseph Shine V. Union of
India#.
4. Next in line for submissions on behalf of private parties is Dr. Abhishek Manu Singhvi, learned
senior counsel. He firstly argued the point of burden of proof under section 24 of the PMLA. He has
pointed out that prior to amendment, the entire burden of proof right from investigation till the
judgment was on the accused. Even though this has changed post 2013 amendment and some
balance has been restored, it has not fully cured this section of its unconstitutional nature. He has
gone into the legislative history of the Act and stated that originally the presumption was raised
even prior to the trial and state of charge, this was diluted by the amendment of 2013 thereafter
the presumption would only apply after the framing of charges.
(i) The learned senior counsel submits that the wording of section 24 refers to formal framing
of charges under section 211 of the Cr. P. C. For this submission, he relies on the speech of the
Minister introducing the amendment in Parliament. It has been stated that presumption is raised
in relation to the fact of money-laundering. Such a presumption cannot be raised in relation to
an essential ingredient of an offence. The commission of an offence, as such, cannot be
presumed. In reference to section 4 of the 1872 Act, distinction between sub-sections (a) and
(b) of section 24 is highlighted, wherein the former states-"shall presume" and the latter
states- "may presume".
(ii) It is urged that post amendment also there is no requirement for the prosecution to prove
any facts once the charges are framed. The entire burden of disproving the case, as set out in
the complaint, inverts onto the accused. It is, hence, contrary to the requirement of proof of
foundational facts, as is seen in other legislations. Such an inversion is not present in any other
statute. It is stated that even in the NDPS Act, where no requirement
*
of foundational facts was provided, this court has read such necessity into the Act. As for sub-
section (b), it is pointed out that the "may presume" provision eliminates the safeguards of sub-
section (a) and provides no guidance as to when a presumption is to be invoked. The learned
counsel also points the discrepancy that the word "authority" appearing in section 24, which also
appears in section 48, is distinctive in nature and that section 24 absurdly allows an investigator
to presume the commission of an offence. This is clearly arbitrary and dehors logic. In light of
the same, the constitutional vires of the section are challenged or a reading down to fulfil the
constitutional mandate is pressed for.
(iii) The next point of attack for Dr. Singhvi, learned senior counsel is the constitutionality of
sections 17 and 18. The absence of safeguards in lieu of searches and seizures is canvassed. It
has been pointed out that such searches or seizures can take place even without an FIR having
been registered or a complaint being filed before a competent court. Foremost, the legislative
history of these two sections is pointed out. It is shown that originally the search and seizure
was to be conducted after the filing of a chargesheet or complaint in the predicate offence.
Thereafter, the protection was diluted by the 2009 amendment, wherein it was provided that the
search and seizure operations would take place only after forwarding a report to the Magistrate
under section 157 of the Cr. P. C. It was only in 2019 that these final safeguards were also
completely removed by the Finance (No. 2) Act, 2019. The effect, it is argued, is such that the
The surest way t legal research!"
ED has unfettered powers to commit searches and seizures without any investigation having
been done in the predicate offence, and sometimes even without an FIR being registered. There
are no prerequisites or safeguards as the ED can now simply walk into a premises. Even for non-
cognizable offences, the ED need not wait for the filing of a complaint before a court. In this
way, in the absence of any credible information to investigate, the ED cannot be allowed to use
such uncanalized power. The magisterial oversight cannot be replaced by the limited oversight of
the Adjudicating Authority, as they have no real control over the ED, especially in case of
criminal investigations. Thus, it is submitted that such lack of effective checks and balances is
unreasonable and violative of articles 14 and 21 of the Constitution.
(iv) Our attention is also drawn to the Prevention of Money-Laundering (Forms, Search and
Seizure or Freezing and the Manner of Forwarding the Reasons and Material to the Adjudicating
Authority, Impounding and Custody of Records and the Period of Retention) Rules,
2005*, and it is prayed that this court must clarify that these rules are not ultra vires sections
17 and 18 of the PMLA. Pertinently, they relate to the provisions of Cr. P. C. being applicable to
searches under the Act.
(v) Next leg of submissions challenges the vires of the second proviso to section 5(1), as it
allows for attachment independent of the existence of a predicate offence, given that such
property might not even be proceeds of crime. Though an emergency procedure, no threshold
had to be met and the first proviso has no application. It is also submitted that the proviso
cannot travel beyond the scope of the main provision. Our attention is drawn to the legislative
history; it is stated that the PMLA did not originally contain the second proviso. Attachment was
only to be done after filing of chargesheet in the predicate offence. For the first time, in 2009,
this proviso was added, to avoid frustration of the proceedings. It is submitted that this proviso
has no anchor to either the scheduled offence or the proceeds of crime. It is at the mere
satisfaction of the officer. In this way, it is submitted, attachment of property of any person can
be made, with no fetters. Our attention is also drawn to the use of word "any" for person and
property and its distinction from the term "proceeds of crime", having a direct nexus with the
ambit of the main section. It is argued that it is not to be mixed with any offence but only
scheduled offences. The ED is alleged to employ this language in attaching property purchased
much before the commission of scheduled offences, to the extent not having any nexus. It is
submitted that there has to be a link between the second proviso to the proceeds of crime and
scheduled offence being investigated under a specific ECIR before the ED**
(vi) Submissions with respect to section 8 of the PMLA maintain that section 8(4) allows the
ED to take possession of the attached property at the stage of confirmation of provisional
attachment made by the Adjudicating Authority. It is submitted that this deprivation of a
person's right to property at such an early stage without the due process of law, is
unconstitutional. Further the period of attachment under section 8(3)(a) of the PMLA is also
arbitrary and unreasonable. To make good the point, the relevant legislative history is pointed
out. The original enactment where provisional attachment would continue during the pendency
of proceedings related to "any scheduled offence". Thereafter in 2012, the same was changed to
"any offence under the PMLA", followed by 2018 amendment-"a period of ninety days during
investigation of the offence or
* For short, "Seizure Rules, 2005".
during pendency of proceedings under the PMLA", and finally by 2019 amendment the
increase from 'ninety days' to 'three hundred and sixty- five days'. We are also taken through
the elaborate process of attachment of property. Thereby, it is highlighted that the ED can take
possession of property after a single adjudicatory process, wherein there is no oversight over the
ED. It is stated that such alienation of property without any proceedings having been brought
before the court is undoubtedly an unconstitutional act. As for section 8(3)(a) clarification is
sought in right of the confusion that it allows for a continuation of the confirmed provisional
attachment for three hundred and sixty-five days or during the pendency of proceedings under
the PMLA. This might lead to a reading where the ED has a period of three hundred and sixty-
five days to file its complaint.
(vii) The learned counsel then referred to the Prevention of Money- Laundering (Taking
Possession of Attached or Frozen Properties Confirmed by the Adjudicating Authority) Rules,
2013* wherein specific challenge is raised against rules 4(4), 5(3), 5(4) and 5(6). The main
ground of challenge is disproportionality, similar to the attachment issue, transfer of attached
shares and mutual funds, depressing of value of property, eviction of owners of a movable
property, possession of productive assets along with gross income, all monetary benefit is stated
to be arbitrary, reasonable, absurd and disproportionate. Herein, it is highlighted that various
anomalies may crop up, such as taking of the shares and the ED becoming the majority
shareholder in corporations, attachment of properties worth far more than the value of proceeds
of crime. Under section 2(1)(zb), the expression "value" is defined as fair market value on the
date of acquisition and not fair market value on date of attachment. Arguably, property bought
years ago is thereby undervalued by the ED. Attachment of immovable property and eviction in
case of unregistered leases is also challenged. To challenge this disproportionate imposition and
restrictions, reliance is placed on Shayara Bano (supra) and Anuradha Bhasin V. Union of
India*
(viii) It is then urged by the learned counsel that section 45(1) of the PMLA, reverses the
presumption of innocence at the stage of bail as an accused. According to him, the accused at
this stage can never show that he is not guilty. It is also maintained that these are
disproportionate and excessive conditions for a bail. Reference is also made to Nikesh Tarachand
Shah (supra) to the limited extent that the 2018 amendment has not removed invalidity,
pointed out in the aforesaid judgment of this court. It is
* For short, "Taking Possession Rules, 2013".
also stated that regardless of the amendment, the twin condition is in violation of article 21 of
the Constitution by virtue of the nature of the offence under the PMLA. It is stated that
presumption of innocence is a cardinal principle of Indian criminal jurisprudence*. Reference
is
also made to Kiran Prakash Kulkarni V. Enforcement Directorate** Arguments have also been
raised against an amendment through a Money Bill being violative of article 110 of the
Constitution. The need for interpretation by Rojer Mathew V. South Indian Bank Ltd. has also
been asserted. The 2018 amendment is also challenged by referring to the Notes on Clauses of
the Finance Bill, 2018. It is also pointed out that similar amendments were proposed for the
1962 Act in the year 2012 and, yet, the same were dropped at the insistence of members of
Parliament#.
(ix) Further, given the maximum punishment of seven (7) years under PMLA, it was argued
that it is disproportionate when comparing the same to other offences under the IPC which are
far more serious in nature and are punishable with death. In light of the same, it is highly
questionable as to how such an onerous condition can be imposed on an accused. It is also
pointed out that several scheduled offences are bailable. Further, the anomaly that at the time of
arrest under section 19 no documents are provided in certain cases, has also been highlighted.
It was also stated that it is a near impossibility to get bail as under the UAPA, TADA Act, or the
Prevention of Terrorism Act, 2002##.
5. Mr. Mukul Rohatgi, learned senior counsel was next to argue on behalf of private parties. He
urged that the Explanation to section 44 is contrary to section 3 read with section 2(1)(u), hence,
the same is unsustainable and arbitrary in the eyes of law. Special emphasis was laid on the
expression "shall not be dependent upon any order by the trial court in the scheduled offence". It
was argued that both trials may be tried by the same court. In such a case, section 3 offence
cannot be given pre-eminence, as that would run contrary to section 3 and would be manifestly
arbitrary, given the fact that an acquittal in the scheduled offence cannot lead to one being found
guilty for the derivative offence of money-laundering. A direct link between the proceeds of crime
and section 3 offence was also highlighted. It was submitted that the Special Court cannot continue
with the trial for section 3 offence once acquittal in the predicate offence takes place. Section 44
unmistakably provides for the Special Court trial of money-laundering.
Order dated April 11, 2019 in S.L.P. (Criminal) No. 1698 of 2019.
# Speech of Shri Arun Jaitley dated March 26, 2012 in the Rajya Sabha.
# # For short, "POTA".
It was pointed out that it is normal that if one is acquitted for the predicate offence, the money-
laundering procedure could still go on. This is contrary to the definition under section 3, which
states that money-laundering is inextricably linked to the predicate offence.
(i) It was also pointed out that the usual practice is of filing an ECIR on the same day or right
after the FIR has been filed by replicating it almost verbatim. Canvassing for proper procedure
and investigation before filing of the ECIR and initiation of the process under the PMLA, reference
was also made to other Acts, such as Smugglers and Foreign Exchange Manipulators Act, 1976*,
FERA or Conservation of Foreign Exchange and Prevention of Smuggling Activities Act, 1974**
and the 1962 Act, being Acts which would not subsist alone or by themselves without the
predicate offences**
(ii) It was also argued that often the ED widens the investigation beyond what is contained in
the charge-sheet. This is contrary to the intentions of the Act. The true meaning of the definition
under section 3 of the PMLA was proposed to be divided into three components of predicate
offence, proceeds of crime and projecting/claiming as untainted. It was conceded that even
abetment would form a part of the offence and as a consequence, whoever attempts, assists,
abets, incites-are all covered by the same. For predicate offence and section 3, it was stated
that if the former is gone, the latter cannot subsist.
(iii) Next argument raised pertained to the ambit and meaning of section 3. It was submitted
that mere possession or concealment of proceeds of crime will not constitute money-laundering
and this was bolstered by the phrase "projecting or claiming as untainted property". The "and"
was stated to be a watertight compartment. The Finance Minister's 2012 Rajya Sabha Speech
was also relied upon to showcase how "and projecting" was an essential element.
6. Mr. Amit Desai, learned senior counsel also advanced submissions on behalf of private parties.
He also took us through the history of money- laundering, starting from the Conventions to the
FATF and UN General Assembly Resolution# which led to the 1999 Bill to help combat and prevent
money-laundering. He relies on the Statement of Objects and Rea

June 1998.
sons of the Act*, followed by the initial ambit of sections 2(1)(p), (u) and 3, which were amended
by the 2013 amendment. It is stated that the Act presupposes the commission of a crime which is
the predicate offence; hence the questions to be answered by this court are related to
retrospectivity. Firstly-whether authorities can proceed against an accused when commission of
the predicate offence predates the addition of the said offences to the Schedule of the PMLA ?
Secondly-whether the authorities can proceed against the properties obtained or projected prior to
the commission of an offence under this Act ? Thirdly-whether authorities can proceed when the
predicate offence and the projecting predate the commencement of this Act ? Fourthly-whether
jurisdiction subsists under the Act when no cognisance has been taken, the accused has been
discharged or acquitted or the offence compounded ? Lastly, the learned counsel also challenges
the rigours of the twin conditions for being incongruent with general bail provisions under sections
437 and 439 of the Cr. P. C. as being ultra vires.
(i) The learned counsel refers to one of the cases in this batch, wherein the properties sought
to be acquired bv the ED were obtained bv the petitioner prior to 2009. while the commission of

offence was in 2013 and section 13 of the PC Act was inserted into the PMLA Schedule for the
first time in 2009. This, it is maintained cannot fit into the term "proceeds of crime" under
section 2(1)(u), the same having been done prior to 2009. It has also been submitted that for
the determination of money-laundering under section 3 or any other provision of the Act, the
relevant time has to be the time of the commission of the scheduled offence. The rationale being
that only the presence of a scheduled offence can lead to the generation of proceeds of crime
and, hence, in return the offence of money-laundering can be committed. Thus, in a way it is
suggested that the starting point for a conviction for section 3 might be the commission of a
scheduled offence. The argument in respect of the protections provided by the Constitution
under article 20(1), as per which ingredients for an offence must exist on the day the crime is
committed or detected, have also been impressed in opposition of any retrospective or
retroactive application of the Act. To bolster the arguments, reliance has been placed on the
decisions of this court in Soni Devrajbhai Babubhai V. State of Gujarat**
* "objective was to enact a comprehensive legislation, inter alia, for preventing money laundering
and connected activities confiscation of proceeds of crime, setting up of agencies and mechanisms
for co-ordinating measures for combating money-laundering, etc.". It was also indicated that the
proposed Act was "an Act to prevent money-laundering and to provide for confiscation of property
derived from, or involved in, money-laundering and for matters connected therewith or incidental
thereto".

and Foods Pvt. Ltd. V. Directorate of Enforcement###
(ii) The argument that to qualify for the offence of money-laundering, the essential ingredient
of "projection" or "claiming" it as "untainted property" is imperative, has also been pressed into
service. It is also urged that proceeds of crime can only be generated from the commission of a
predicate offence and the commencement of investigation arises only if a predicate offence has
generated such proceeds of crime only subsequent to the inclusion of the predicate offence to
the Schedule of the PMLA. Another point that has been highlighted is that the projecting, if done
prior to the date of inclusion of the offence to the Schedule, the same cannot be continuing and
as such, is stated to be stillborn for the purposes of the PMLA.
(iii) It is urged that for the purposes of bail, it is settled law that offences punishable for less
than seven years allows a person to be set free on bail. As such, the liberty as enunciated by
article 21 of the Constitution cannot be defeated by such an Act. Thus, section 45(2) of the PMLA
is contrary to general principles of bail and the Constitution of India. It is also pointed out that
section 437 of the Cr. P. C. imposing similar conditions as section 45(2) restricts it to offences
punishable with either life imprisonment or death. Under no condition can it be said that the bail
conditions under the PMLA, imposing maximum seven years, are reasonable. Without prejudice
to the aforementioned argument, it was stated that section 45(2) could only be applicable to bail
applications before the Special Court and the special powers under section 439 of the Cr. P. C. It
was submitted that in light of the same, special powers be given to the Special Court under the
PMLA, as these provisions, draconian in nature, were contemplated only in Acts, such as TADA
Act, POTA, MCOCA and NDPS Act, since securing

the presence was difficult in all of the above. Further, unless section 3 was to be restricted to
organised crime syndicate, which was in fact the real intent, the bail provisions are liable to be
struck down.
7. Mr. S. Niranjan Reddy, learned senior counsel contends that it is essential to first understand
as to whether money-laundering is a standalone offence or dependent on the scheduled offence ?
He points out that the ED has maintained the former stance. It has been pointed out that this view
has been rejected by the High Courts of Delhi, Allahabad and Telangana. On the contrary, the High
Courts of Madras and Bombay have accepted such a view. It has been added that the ED's
contention is based on the Explanation added to section 44(1)(d) by the 2019 amendment.
Concededly, though there are certain exemptions in section 8(7), it is contended, that the same are
only for special circumstances. The learned counsel then refers to the sequence of conducting the
matters and points out sections 43(2) and 44(1), whereby the Special Court can try the scheduled
offence, as well as, the money-laundering offence. He points out that due to different findings of
different High Courts, certain questions have arisen as to the sequence of conducting the said two
cases. The High Courts of Jharkhand and Kerala have taken a view that both matters can be tried
simultaneously ; there is no necessity to hold back the trial of money-laundering until the
scheduled offence has been tried. It has been submitted that the High Court of Kerala finds that
the offence of money-laundering is dependent on the scheduled offence. The High Court for the
State Telangana, on the other hand, finds money-laundering completely independent of the
scheduled offence. To drive the point home, attention is drawn towards section 212 of the IPC,
where the High Courts have taken a view that unless the original offence is proved, the person
harbouring the accused cannot be sentenced. However, it is also pointed out that section 212 can
be tried simultaneously with the original offence.
(i) Additionally, it has been submitted that section 2(1)(u) and section 3 of the PMLA have
been given a very expansive meaning, whereby people who do not have knowledge or have not
participated, being totally unrelated third parties, are also being roped in to the investigations.
The culpability has to be maintained. Wrong interpretation is given to proceeds of crime to be
any property even obtained or derived indirectly. Persons who have not committed the scheduled
offence deriving certain indirect benefits, even without knowledge, based on section 24
presumption are held to be guilty of laundering money.
(ii) Further, the question of retrospectivity has also been addressed, whereby after the 2019
amendment, money-laundering is now said to be a
continuing offence connected with the proceeds of crime. It is urged that the ED contends
that prosecution or attachment can take place irrespective of whether the alleged offence was
committed even prior to enactment in 2002, irrespective of the addition of the predicate offence
in the PMLA Schedule. It is submitted that there are various amendments which are substantive
in nature, being given retrospective effect, such as sections 2(1)(u), 3, 8, 24, 44, etc. It has also
been brought to our notice that prior to the 2013 amendment in the context of section 8, the
High Court of Andhra Pradesh, the Madras High Court and the High Court of Gujarat have held
that attachment causes civil consequences of confiscation. Meaning that in case a scheduled
offence is committed prior to the enactment of the PMLA or inclusion of certain offences in its
Schedule, attachment or confiscation can go on. However, since then, the amendment has
brought about a new legal question. Today, the line between civil and criminal consequences has
changed, since section 8 now is dependent upon one being held guilty for money-laundering.
Hence, it cannot be applied retrospectively for predicate offences or scheduled offences
committed prior to the PMLA enactment. Reference has also been made to the finding of the
Hyderabad High Court where section 8(5) being quasi criminal, has been found to be
prospective.
8. Dr. Menaka Guruswamy, learned senior counsel urged that substantive due process has
replaced procedure established by law* The learned counsel has also pointed out aspects of
substantive due process and the procedure of mandatory open court review. In the context of right
of accused during interrogation, it was submitted that this court dealt with "due process" rights in
the Mohammed Ajmal Mohammad Amir Kasab alias Abu Mujahid V. State of Maharashtra* where
the use of Miranda rights has been rejected. The learned counsel has also gone into the facts of the
case, where it is stated that there has been a six year long pre-trial procedure in both the predicate
offence and laundering offence with limited right of participation and a reverse burden of proof.
(i) It has also been argued that section 50 infringes upon the right to liberty of a person
summoned under the Act and violates the right against self-incrimination. The non-compliance
with section 53 is penalised through section 63 of the PMLA. The learned counsel has adopted
the arguments made by other learned counsel in reference to Tofan Singh
*
(supra). It is argued that the use of the term "any person" without exclusion of the accused
under section 50 is in violation of the due process. No safeguards provided under the Cr. P. C.
and the 1872 Act are extended to person proceeded for PMLA offence. It is stated that the stage
at which a person is guaranteed the constitutional right under article 20(3), cannot be made
malleable through legislation. It is stated that even though the PMLA is a complaint-based
procedure, by way of section 50, one cannot ignore the pre-complaint stage. As such, section 50
must be rendered unconstitutional. Further, it is argued that the ED practice is a perverse
incentive structure for constitutional infringement where an accused is trapped and sweeping
interrogations are conducted aimed at justifying the summons issued. In respect of section 44
(1)(d), it is stated that the right to a fair trial is taken away and this provision irreversibly
prejudices the accused in the trial adjudicating the predicate offence*.
(ii) Further, the Explanation to section 44(1)(d) requires the two trials to be conducted before
the Special Court, but as separate trials, is said to render the requirement of a fair trial
impossible. To bolster this ground, it is said that when a judge receives evidence under section
50 of the PMLA in case of money-laundering, he cannot remain an independent authority when
deciding the predicate offence based on the material placed before him. Thus, this paradoxical
provision forms a complete absurdity for a judge dealing with two different sets of rights for the
same accused regarding the connected facts. That is for every predicate offence which would
have otherwise been tried by a Magistrate, the investigation by the ED will tend to influence the
mind of the judge** Further, reliance has also been placed on Suo Motu Writ (Crl.) No. 1 of
2017, In re : To issue certain guidelines regarding inadequacies and deficiencies in criminal
trials***. The court has incorporated the Draft Rules of Criminal Practice, 2021 which have been
circulated for adoption by all High Courts. It is also argued that section 44 takes away the right
of appeal from the predicate offences triable by the Magistrate's Court#.
(iii) It is urged that the PMLA creates an overbroad frame with no fetters on investigation. The
refusal to provide a copy of the ECIR creating an opacity surrounding the usage of the ED Manual
is also under challenge.
Hanumant Govind Nargundkar V. State of Madhya Pradesh, AIR 1952 SC 343 (para 10).
(para 11).
section 4(b)(v) of the Right to Information Act, 2005* is pressed into service to showcase
that every public authority is obligated to publish within 120 days of enactment of the Act-the
rules, regulations, instructions, manuals and records held by it or its employees for discharge of
its functions. Contrary to the above-mentioned provisions, the ED Manual is said to be a mystery
for the general public. Reference is also made to the decision of the Bombay High Court, wherein
the Maharashtra Police was asked to provide a copy of the police manual in response to an RTI
application** It is submitted that such non-disclosure of the ED Manual is unsustainable in law.
It makes the securing of pre-trial rights of an accused difficult. Even the CBI manual which is
based on a statutory provision of the Cr. P. C., has been found by this court to be necessary and
The surest way legal research!"
to be adhered scrupulously by the CBI***, Similarly, other authorities, such as the Central
Vigilance Commission, Income-tax authorities, authorities under the 1962 Act, police authorities,
jail authorities, are all governed by manual published by them. Thus, it is only the ED which
follows a distinct approach of non-disclosure.
(iv) It has also been argued that the Schedule of the PMLA renders several bailable offences
as non-bailable when this court has repeatedly held that bail is the rule and jail is the
exception#. Predicate offences which under their original act such as the Bonded Labour System
(Abolition) Act, 1976##, are bailable but on the application of the PMLA, become non-bailable.
The intention and provision of the underlying special Act, hence, becomes otiose by the
overbroad provisions of the PMLA. In another breath, it is argued that the attachment procedure
under the PMLA runs contrary to the provisions contained in the predicate offence. It is also
perplexing, as the underlying statute itself contain the procedure to attach illegal proceeds of
crime. Aid of the UAPA and the Securities and Exchange Board of India Act, 1992### is taken
to buttress that while under the predicate offence, attachment can take place only after the
conviction, section 5 of the PMLA enables attachment of property prior to conviction. This creates
two different standards and two different criminal attachment proceedings for essentially the
same offence. Even the Cr. P. C. provides for depriving

# # For short, "1976 Act".
For short, "SEBI Act".
criminals of the fruit of the crimes and allows for the true owner of the property to be restored
with the position thereof by way of section 452(5).
(v) The next point argued is in respect of the adjudicatory paralysis in the Appellate Tribunal.
It is submitted that it is one of the only safeguards in this draconian law to provide an oversight
to prevent abuse of mechanism of attachment. Even this oversight has been rendered redundant
since there has been no appointment of a chairperson or members of the said Tribunal since
September 21, 2019. Thus, making the Tribunal redundant. Further, it is stated that taking the
possession at the stage when only a provisional attachment has been made, can cause great
hardship and financial ruin, amounting to virtually declaring a person guilty and is avoidable.
Further, certain official data has been brought to our attention to demonstrate the
ineffectiveness of the unconstitutional legislations, where raids have increased each financial
year and, yet, since 2005 the number of convictions till 2015-16 has remained zero and,
thereafter, reached a maximum of four in 2018-19.
9. Then, Mr. Aabad Ponda, learned senior counsel contended that without prejudice to all the
submissions, section 50(3) and section 63(2)(a) and (c) of the PMLA, in so far as they relate to the
accused persons, are ultra vires being violative of articles 20(3) and 21 of the Constitution of India.
He submitted that under the current scheme of the Act, a scheduled offence requires a prior FIR. A
person so named in the FIR would stand in the character of an accused person, and as such, he
cannot be compelled to incriminate himself or produce documents incriminating himself under
section 50(3) of the PMLA. The next leg of the argument is to the extent that section 63(2)(c),
which mandatorily penalises person for disobedience of section 50, cannot be applicable to an
accused person given the constitutional protections of articles 20(3) and 21, whereby he has the
right to exercise his fundamental right to silence. We are also shown the analogous provisions
similar to section 50(3) and 50(4) of the PMLA in other statutes, such as section 171A of the 1878
Act, inserted by section 12 of the Sea Customs (Amendment) Act, 1955 ; section 108 of the 1962
Act ; section 14 of the Central Excises and Salt Act, 1944* and section 40 of the FERA. The learned
counsel further argued and distinguished custom officers and other above referred officers from the
ED officers to the effect that they only recover duty and do not investigate crimes like the ED
officials. Even otherwise, it is to be noted that even though section 50 of the PMLA may appear to
be akin to summons issued under section 18 of 1962 Act and other above-mentioned statutes,
however, there is a deep differentiation. For, when a person is
* For short, "CESA 1944 Act".
summoned under the above-mentioned Acts, such as the 1962 Act, he is not in the shoes of an
accused. He only becomes an accused once an FIR or complaint has been filed before a Magistrate.
This, however, he states, is not the case under the PMLA. To drive home the point as to who stands
in the character of an accused, reference has been made to certain Constitution Bench decisions of
this court, which have already been referred to by the previous learned counsel. To wit, Ramesh
Chandra Mehta V. State of West Bengal*, Balkishan A. Devidayal V. State of Maharashtra** and
Selvi (supra).
(i) Similarly, Mr. Ponda, learned senior counsel also relied on the decision in Ramanlal Bhogilal
Shah V. D. K. Guha and pointed out that even in cases of FERA, a person stands in the
character of an accused in a separate FIR for the same transaction. He cannot be compelled to
incriminate himself. He maintains that this is a case wherein the ED itself had investigated the
accused under the FERA. It was found that even though ordinarily under the FERA a person is
not an accused, however, in this particular case, an FIR had been registered against the said
person and he, being an accused, could not be compelled to answer questions that would
incriminate him. The same plea has also been upheld in Poolpandi V. Superintendent, Central
Excise#. It was urged that an accused cannot be compelled to produce any incriminating
documents which he does not want to produce. Reliance was placed on State of Gujarat V.
Shyamlal Mohanlal Choksi##. Moreover, it is reiterated that the protection against self-
incrimination applies not only in court proceedings, but also at the stage of investigation#
(ii) Further, it was urged that section 2(1)(na) of the PMLA defines "investigation". As such,
proceedings under section 50 is clearly a part of investigation for the collection of evidence. The
summons under section 50(2) is to give evidence or produce records during the course of
investigation under the Act, thus, protected by article 20(3). section 50(4) of the PMLA also
stipulates that they are judicial proceedings, therefore, a person accused will be protected under
article 20(3). Section 63(2)(a) and 63(2)(c) inflict grave prejudice upon the accused, as he is
liable to be further prosecuted for the failure to give information and provide documents which

labelled as non-cooperative during the proceedings

which are judicial in nature and used as a pretext to arrest or extend remand under the PMLA.
It is a direct affront to fundamental rights and a travesty of justice.
10. Mr. Siddharth Aggarwal, learned senior counsel, also appeared for the private parties. His
main opposition is to the retrospective application of the PMLA. Certain questions are raised with
respect to whether prosecution for money-laundering is permissible if the commission of scheduled
offence and proceeds of crime takes place prior to the PMLA coming into force; and, similarly, in a
situation when it is committed prior to the offence being made part of the Schedule of the PMLA. It
is submitted that the prohibition against retrospective operation of substantial criminal statutes is a
constitutional imperative which needs to be given its fullest interpretation in a purposive manner.
He highlights the three situations where interpretation is warranted. One, where transactions were
concluded prior to the enforcement of PMLA ; two, prior to the offences being added to the
Schedule of the PMLA ; and three, whether amendment is applied with retrospective effect couched
in the guise of an Explanation introduced by the 2019 amendment.
(i) It is urged that no person can be convicted for criminal offence unless it has been
specifically given retrospective effect, given the essential ingredient of "knowledge" of the
person for taking such an action and exposing himself to criminal liability. In line with the
protection under article 20(1) and the maxim of "nova constitutio futuris formam imponere
debet non praeteritis"*, judgments of this court were relied to urge that the general rule is
applicable when the purpose of the statute in question is to affect vested rights/impose new
burdens/impair existing obligations**
(ii) To make good the submission on retrospectivity, it is pointed out that as per the
definition, money-laundering is dependent on proceeds of crime, which in turn depends on
criminal activity relating to a scheduled offence. As such, it is stated that no proceeds of crime
can exist to be generated from a criminal activity unless the PMLA comes into force. That too, it
has to be connected to the date when the Schedule has accepted the new predicate offence. It
only means that property which is not "proceeds of crime", cannot by virtue of PMLA,
retrospectively characterised as such in
* Keshavan Madhava Menon V. State of Bombay, AIR 1951 SC 128 (para 15).
;
a true sense. Further, prior to the enactment of the PMLA, there was no similar offence dealing
in proceeds of crime or economic advantages derived from criminal offences. He points out that
there were various enactments which dealt with the illegal fruits of criminal activity. Thus, the
PMLA cannot be added to the list of disabilities in law to illegal monies in a retrospective manner.
He was critical about many amendments taken place over the years and especially the fact that
the true import of section 3 is being expanded by a mere addition of an Explanation in 2019. As
such the purport of the main, a much narrow provision, cannot be changed*. None of the
amendments to section 3 or changes in Schedule have a language bearing a retrospective effect.
section 3 amendment was only "for removal of doubts" in contrast with the amendment of
section 45 which was "deemed to have always meant". Several judgments of the High Courts,
pending adjudication before this Court, holding that the PMLA cannot be applied retrospectively,
were also referred**
(iii) Additionally, the impact of insertion of clause (ii) of the Explanation to section 3 vide the
2019 amendment, is also questioned. It is stated that a continuing offence is not defined in any
statute. Some offences are described in a way that make it clear that the offending activity is a
continuing one, some illustrations are in section 281 in the Cantonments Act, 2006*** ; section
36(1)(iii)(d) in the Pharmacy Act, 1948# and sections 162(1) and 220(3) in the Companies Act.
Hence, a continuing offence is one which can be distinguished from an offence which is
committed once and for all. It is submitted that it is an offence where until the obeying or
compliance of rule or a requirement is effectuated, every subsequent

non-compliance leads to the commission of the offence again and again*. In case of money-
laundering, it is urged that there is a clear starting point and an end point to the same, where
the generation of proceeds of crime starts and ends in the integration of proceeds of crime into
the financial bloodstream as untainted money. Thus, though it may take place over time but it
cannot be considered as a continuing offence. Further, for the purpose of substantive
interpretation, no reference can be made to the Explanation added by the 2019 amendment,
since it is a mere Explanation which cannot widen the ambit of the main section itself**.
11. Mr. Mahesh Jethmalani, learned senior counsel was next in line to advance submissions on
behalf of the private parties. He submitted that section 44(1)(a) of the PMLA is unconstitutional
and violative of articles 14 and 21 of the Constitution. He contends that there is no nexus of the
said section with the object of the PMLA. This section does not contemplate a joint trial of the
offence under section 3 and the scheduled offence. Further, he interprets section 44(1)(a) to mean
that the Special Court can only try the scheduled offence, but not together ; it has to be separately
tried as per the provisions of the Cr. P. C. It is also said that the rationale behind this change is
difficult to fathom. On the other hand, it is pointed out that the accused's right of being tried as per
the Cr. P. C., for scheduled offence is being violated, at least in respect of 37 out of 58 scheduled
offences of the IPC noted in the Schedule to the 2002 Act, are triable exclusively by a Magistrate of
the First Class or any Magistrate. In support of this argument, reliance has been placed on A. R.
Antulay V. R. S. Nayak***. It is submitted that the present interpretation of this section leads to
the violation of the right to be tried by a Magistrate First Class, the right of a first appeal to
Sessions Court under section 374(3) and the right of revision to the High Court under section 401
of the Cr. P. C. from the appellate judgment of the Sessions Court. This leads to a rather oppressive
interpretation where an accused who is not charged under the PMLA offence but only under the
predicate offence is also tried by the Special Court. This is also hit by the fact that several of the
scheduled offences within the PMLA are themselves part of special statutes which prescribe that
they shall be tried by the Special Court established under those special statutes exclusively. For
example,
(paras 15-20)].
the PC Act, the NDPS Act and the National Investigation Agency Act, 2008*. Thus, in such a case
the PMLA Special Court cannot have power to try offences punishable under those Acts. The phrase
"any scheduled offences" as contemplated under section 44(1)(a) of the PMLA is in a manifest
conflict with these three statutes and, hence, liable to be struck down. The learned counsel also
submits that the section is a legal absurdity as to how a Special Court could try a scheduled offence
before the commencement of the Act without which commencement of the Special Court has no
existence. It is also stated the discretion to choose which issue or scheduled offence to try before
the Special Court lies only with the authority authorised to file a complaint under the PMLA, which
is a discretionary and unfettered arbitrary power.
(i) As regards section 44(1)(c), it is urged that the same does not mandate disclosure of any
reason for filing the application. Further, such an application can be moved at any stage of the
proceedings for the inquiry or trial of a scheduled offence. Such a provision cannot be read to
allow committal at a stage when the trial is over and only the judgment remains to be delivered.
This tantamounts to authorising exercise of administrative fiat in respect of subject matter,
which is in fact a quasi-judicial act. Similarly, even the Magistrate is not obligated to state
reasons while deciding the application and as such his order, if not reasoned, will be a nullity.
The interpretation of the words "commit" and "committed" is said to be misconceived under
section 44(1)(c). It is urged that the use of the word 'committal' is inappropriate and the real
intention of the present section is a mere transfer of the case to the PMLA Special Court. As
such, it is submitted that the case be sent to the Special Court which has already taken
cognisance of the complaint under the PMLA and not any other Special Court. Reliance has been
placed on the decision of the Delhi High Court in Directorate of Enforcement V. Surajpal** and
on the other hand, the decision of the High Court of Kerala in Inspector of Police, CBI V. Asst.
Directorate, Directorate of Enforcement (PMLA)*** wherein it is observed that it is
not
mandatory to make an application for committal to Special Court in every case and, similarly,
not mandatory for the court to allow every such application without application of mind and
dehors the merits of the case. Hence, the conflict of view between the two High Courts needs to
be resolved.
* For short, "NIA Act".
(ii) Referring to section 45, it is argued that sections 201 and 212 of the IPC provide for
graded punishment or in line with the principle of an accessory after the fact. Attention has been
drawn to a few cases to show that these sections prescribe gradation of punishment depending
on the nature of offence which the principal offender has committed*. It is stated that section 3
of the PMLA offence also is one kind of an accessory after the fact offence. It is also maintained
that in certain cases the proceeds of crime or the scheduled offence may be committed by some
person and the laundering might be done by a completely different person. In such a case,
where money-laundering is not directly connected with the scheduled offence, the laundering is
merely an accessory after the fact. He submits that even though the offence of money-
laundering is a serious offence, however, the severest punishment is only seven years. Thus,
twin conditions under section 45 are grossly disproportionate and illogical for the crimes
provided under the PMLA. It is also stated that the equation of the bail provisions under the
PMLA cannot be made to the NDPS Act or UAPA. Further, even a serial murderer who may be
liable for capital punishment is not subjected to such stringent condition, as under section 45 of
the PMLA. Irrespective of the deleterious impact on the economy of a country, it does not shock
the conscience of the society as much as the conduct of the serial murderer. Reliance is also
placed upon Nikesh Tarachand Shah (supra) in support of the argument that even if the
amendment to section 45 (which was struck down in the aforementioned case) saves the
conditions from the vices on which it was struck down, the vice of article 21 persists owing to
the presumption of innocence having been turned on its head. It is also said that the current
provision has no compelling State interest for tackling serious crime and we must be doubly sure
to allow such attack on the fundamental right of personal liberty.
(iii) As for section 24 and the burden of proof which is reversed within this Act, it is stated
that section 24(a) applies only after charges have been framed by the Special Court. Section 24
(b) refers to persons not charged with the offence of money-laundering under section 3 and it is
further contended that section 24(a) and (b) have no application to proceedings for bail.
Furthermore, it is stated that presumption of innocence is a golden thread running through all
criminal proceedings. This can apply only in cases of extremely serious offences on the ground of
compelling State interest. It is submitted that in such a case where the maximum sentence is of
seven years, such a provision is ultra vires article 21 of the
Constitution. It is argued that in special statutes like UAPA, MCOCA and the PC Act, the
reverse burden of proof has only been upheld due to the compelling State interest, such as
security and public order. Thus, it is agreed that in cases of narco terrorism, underworld, gangs
the undoubted evils may prosper ; hence, section 24(a) can accordingly be read down so as to
apply to cases of laundering where the predicate offence seeks to punish nefarious activities.
12. Mr. Abhimanyu Bhandari, learned counsel also argued on behalf of private parties. His
foremost challenge is to the interpretation of section 3, post addition of the Explanation vide the
2019 amendment. He has more or less reiterated the same arguments as advanced by the previous
learned counsel that by way of Explanation, the ingredient of offence under section 3 is sought to
be altered by reading "and" as "or". He has relied upon the reports and speeches of the Minister in
the Parliament. Additionally, he has placed reliance on the Vienna Convention and United Nations
Convention Against Transnational Organized Crime, 2000*, which state that money-laundering is
only committed if the "use" and/or "concealment" is "for the purposes of concealing or disguising
the illicit origin of the property" or "helping any person who has been involved in the commission of
the predicate offence to evade the legal consequences of his/her action"**. Reliance is also placed
on Nikesh Tarachand Shah (supra), wherein it has been held that it is the concealing or disguising
by projecting tainted monies as untainted money and not their spending that is prohibited.
(i) Thus, exception is taken that the Explanation as added by the 2019 amendment has
wholly changed the scope of the main provision which is the definition. It is contrary to the
concerns of the Select Committee and subsequent to this Explanation, a person would now
commit the offence of money-laundering the minute proceeds of crime are generated. A
similarity is drawn with section 1956 of the United States Code** where money- laundering
is
to conceal the illicit background of the source of the money. Further, reliance is also placed on
American decisions where the Circuit Courts have held that it is not spending or using of
proceeds of crime that amounts to the offence of money-laundering, but laundering of such
proceeds of crime#. Further, it has been stated that this court in a catena of

decisions, held that newly added Explanations must be read so as to harmonise and clear of
ambiguity in the main section and cannot be construed to widen the ambit of the previous state
of the section*.
(ii) The next contention is regarding the definition of "proceeds of crime" and use of value
thereof, defined under section 2(1)(u) of the PMLA. It is argued that it can be categorised into
three types, namely : one-property derived or obtained, directly or indirectly, by any person as
a result of criminal activity relating to a scheduled offence ; or, two-the value of such property
that is property derived or obtained, directly or indirectly, by any person as a result of criminal
activity relating to a scheduled offence; and third-where such property is taken on field outside
the country, then the property equivalent in value held within the country or abroad.
(iii) It is submitted that by reason of the Explanation(s) added in 2019, it cannot be
interpreted to include property not only derived or obtained from the scheduled offence but also
any property which may directly or indirectly be derived or obtained as a result of any criminal
activity relatable to the scheduled offence. Further, the Explanation to the term "property", also
would now include property "used in the commission of an offence". To this, reference is made to
articles 1 and 5 of the Vienna Convention and article 12 of the Palermo Convention to show that
if the criminal activity does not generate any proceeds, then there cannot be any "proceeds of
crime". Further, the ambit of property also is said to have been enlarged disproportionately. As
such, proceeds of crime need to be generated from the scheduled offence alone and not any
criminal activity. To demonstrate the vice, various illustrations were also pointed out to us. It is
imperative that courts can differentiate between property being used to commit an offence and
property derived from the commission of an offence, as is already accepted in other common law
countries** Thus, it is submitted that such an amendment by way of Explanation cannot
expand the scope of a section. Reference is also made to the fact that attachment of property of
an equivalent value where the actual proceeds are no longer available, is similar to other Acts,
such as the UAPA, the NDPS Act, the Prohibition of Benami Property Transactions Act, 1988***
and the Fugitive Economic Offenders Act, 2018#, all having similar definition of proceeds of
crime. Objection is taken to term "property equivalent in value", where

Prakash Sharma, AIR 2013 SC 30.

# For short, "2018 Act".
properties are attached which have been derived from proceeds of crime even if they are
different from the original form when the proceeds were generated*. Further, for the
interpretation of "value thereof", it is said that a broader interpretation would be contrary to
sections 8(5) and 8(6) of the PMLA. Hence, by way of illustration, where the original proceeds of
crime are interchanged and mixed with legitimate money, it is argued that giving a broad
interpretation to "value thereof" would be unreasonable**
(iv) In respect of section 8, it is argued that the true meaning of the words "take possession"
of property under section 8(4) should be constructive possession instead of physical possession
since it is highly prejudicial for the accused during the pendency of the trial. Reliance is placed
on a decision that has been stayed by the Division Bench of the Madras High Court which had
originally held it to be symbolic possession instead of actual***. It is urged that article 300A is
not only a constitutional right but also a human right. Further, confiscation is only subject to
conviction and such disposition in all practical sense, leads to a confiscation prior to such
conviction. Further, since there is no compensation in case a person is eventually acquitted, this
would be a disproportionate action. As such, the argument that one needs to be restrained from
selling or creating encumbrance is valid, the dispossession is not.
13. Mr. N. Hariharan, learned senior counsel, who argued next, referred to Nikesh Tarachand
Shah (supra). Vide this decision, twin conditions in section 45(1)(ii) of the PMLA, came to be struck
down being violative of articles 13(2), 14 and 21 of the Constitution. He submits that post
Constitution laws declared unconstitutional for violation of Part III as void ab initio cannot be
revived by amendments#, as such laws are void since inception. Further, he relied upon State of
Gujarat V. Shri Ambica Mills Ltd.# to contend that section 45(1) cannot survive on the statute
books (supra). Reference has also been made to G. Mohan Rao V. State of Tamil Nadu###. In his
argument, two situations evolving from the decision of Nikesh Tarachand Shah (supra) have been
put forth. One, where only the twin conditions were stuck down and the remaining provision
remained untouched. Second,

where classification based on Part A of the Schedule was also struck down in addition to striking
down of the twin conditions. The second situation is said to be even more damaging given that the
substitution by the Finance Act, 2018 is targeted only to this classification of Part A of the
Schedule, since the court in the reported decision found this classification to be manifestly
arbitrary, as it bore no rational relation to the object of the Act. Hence, the substitution by the
Finance Act, 2018 cannot be justified, as the substitution of this pre-existing term cannot appear
on the statute book due to the striking down. It also reminded that this submission was made
without prejudice to the contention that the twin conditions themselves need to be enacted
separately since they have been struck down. Further, even if the violation of article 14 has been
cured, such amendments cannot go on to cure the defect of violation of article 21.
14. Mr. Vikram Chaudhari, learned senior counsel also representing private parties, raised a
challenge against the twin conditions of section 45(1) which were held unconstitutional in Nikesh
Tarachand Shah (supra). Relying on the dictum of this court in State of Manipur V. Surjakumar
Okram*, he submitted that once held unconstitutional, a statute is obliterated entirely, as if it had
never been passed, non est for all purposes. He has also relied on his own interpretation of how
section 45(1) is to be read post Nikesh Tarachand Shah (supra). He has also pointed out that
despite this decision an editorial error where bare acts, post the judgment, did not remove the
offending (void) provision. It is, therefore, submitted that issue is not whether twin conditions
under section 45(1) would apply or not or of their constitutional validity, but would be as to their
existence. He also referred to clauses 204 and 205 of the Bill which amended section 45 in 2018**,
The intention was to take steps to further delink the scheduled offence and money-laundering
offence, and to allow the courts to apply lenient bail provisions, for sick and infirm. Further, the
interpretation to the amendment sought by the State is said to be ill-founded and untenable since
there is no reference to the pronouncement of Nikesh Tarachand
Which states that "(v) to amend section 45 of the Act relating to offences to be cognizableand
non-bailable and to amend sub-section (1) of section 45 to substitute the words"punishable for a
term of imprisonment of more than three years under Part A of theSchedule" by words "under this
Act" so as to take a step further towards delinking theScheduled offence and money laundering
offence. Further, it seeks to amend the proviso insub-section (1) by inserting the words "or is
accused either on his own or along withother co-accused of money laundering a sum of less than
Rupees one crore", after thewords "sick or infirm" to allow the court to apply lenient bail provisions
in case of moneylaundering offence is not grave in nature." (emphasis supplied).
Shah (supra) and was for the purpose of delinking the scheduled offence and money-laundering
:
(i) In respect of the procedure found in Chapter XII of the Cr. P. C. for the purposes of
investigation, he relied upon Ashok Munilal Jain V. Assistant Director, Directorate of Enforcement*,
wherein it had been noted that section 4(2) of the Cr. P. C. prescribes mandatory application even
in respect to special statutes unless expressly barred**. Thus, the dictum is that the provisions of
the Cr. P. C. would be applicable to the extent in the absence of any contrary provision in the
special Act or any special provision excluding the jurisdiction or applicability of the Cr. P. C. The
point of admissibility of statement made to customs officers and section 25 of the 1872 Act is also
touched again** Relying upon Om Prakash V. Union of India#, it is argued that in the absence of
a procedure to investigate irrespective of cognizability, no investigation can be permitted in law.
And in respect of cognizable offence, the investigation cannot go on without recording information
under section 154 or 155 of the Cr. P. C., forwarding of report or FIR to competent Magistrate under
section 157 of the Cr. P. C., maintaining a paginated case diary as under section 172 of the Cr. P.
C., as also, its production before the Magistrate, as provided by section 167.
(ii) A passing reference is also made to the Railway Property (Unlawful Possession) Act, 1966##
whereby vide section 6, the application of section 155 Cr. P. C. was excluded, but in the case of
PMLA, since there is no express departure from these provisions of the Cr. P. C., it being a non-
cognizable offence, all these protections must come into play. In contradistinction, if it is found to
be a cognizable offence, all protections including under sections 154, 157, 167 and 172 Cr. P. C.,
will prevail.
(iii) Reliance was also placed on Union of India V. Thamisharasi # # with respect to the NDPS Act
and the application of the provisions of the Cr. P. C. For our perusal, a comparative chart had been

placed in the PMLA. Thus, it is urged that safeguards of the Cr. P. C. were applicable being
mandatory, to the extent of the Magistrate being a part of all stages of investigation,
commencement and closure of investigation, maintenance of a case diary, adherence to sections
154, 155 and 157, ability to pursue anticipatory bail, bail under sections 437 and 439, inherent
jurisdiction under section 482 and article 226 of the Constitution and other records or information
which helps to curb fishing and roving enquiries.
(iv) Reliance is placed on the decision of the Punjab and Haryana High Court at Chandigarh in
Gorav Kathuria V. Union of India*, which has attained finality, as this court has declined to interfere
in the order of the High Court. Reliance is also placed on the decision of this court in D. K. Basu V.
State of W. B.**. It is urged that in a case under the Drugs and Cosmetics Act, 1940*** where
police officers could no longer investigate, FIRs were made over to the Drug Inspectors. This is
indicative of the correct procedure to be followed, unless otherwise provided, even investigation of
offences under the special Acts will be governed by the Cr. P. C. alone#.
(v) It is then argued that an umbilical cord connection exists between the scheduled offence and
the money-laundering offence. The Explanation to section 44 is to disconnect the link between the
two, since the findings recorded in the trial of the scheduled offence would not have a bearing on
the case under the PMLA. Again, reference is made to Nikesh Tarachand Shah (supra). It is urged
that the proceeds of crime under section 2(1)(u) are relatable to a specific scheduled or predicate
offence due to the insertion of the word "the" instead of "any" and, as such, the ambit cannot be
broadened to "any" scheduled or predicate offence# #. He submits that certain conclusions are
inevitable. Before the ED starts investigation, there must be some commencement under the
scheduled or predicate offence. The trials for the specifically connected proceeds of crime and
scheduled or predicate offence must be tried together. Finding showing no involvement of accused
to the proceeds of crime or criminal activity must cease the proceedings under the PMLA. Non-
compliance of section 44(1)(c) will vitiate the PMLA proceedings. Further, it is submitted that the
scope of money-laundering is limited to projecting
For short, "1940 Act".
and claiming as untainted property, that too relatable to the scheduled offence*. In light of the said
argument, it is said that the projecting of such proceeds of crime as untainted can be termed as a
standalone offence. In furtherance of same, certain facts of the case being Criminal Appeal Nos.
391 and 392 of 2018 titled Adjudicating Authority (PMLA) V. Ajay Kumar Gupta, were also referred
to, where the FIR and scheduled offence are both prior to the coming into force of the PMLA and,
yet, an ECIR was filed in 2015 after a delay of about 10 years.
15. Mr. Akshay Nagarajan was the last learned counsel to argue on behalf of the private parties.
He contended that even though the definitions under section 3 read with section 2(1)(u), two
conjunctive parts, are meant to cover scheduled offences, they are being used to bring within its
sweep even non-scheduled offences. He has contended that the present definition of section 3 is
wide enough to take within its sweep any non-scheduled offence due to the first part of the
definition. "acquisition. use. concealment. possession is capable". However. this contrast is
impermissible in law** To buttress this plea, provision of section 71 of the IPC and article 20(2)
are invoked*** He has also submitted that for the purpose of section 50(3), any statement
recorded and deemed to be judicial proceeding, cannot be used in light of section 132 of the 1872
Act#.
Submissions of the Union of India
16. Mr. Tushar Mehta, learned Solicitor General led the arguments on behalf of the Union of
India, followed by Mr. S. V. Raju, learned Additional Solicitor General.
(i) At the outset, it is submitted by the learned Solicitor General that as on date, around 4,700
cases are being investigated by the ED, which is a small number as compared to annual
registration of the cases under the Money Laundering Act in UK (7,900), USA (1,532), China
(4,691), Austria (1,036), Hongkong (1,823), Belgium (1,862), Russia (2,764). Further, only 2086
cases were taken up for investigation in last five years under the PMLA out of registration of
approximately 33 lakh FIRs relating to predicate offences by police and other enforcement
agencies.
State of Bombay V. S. L. Apte AIR 1961 SC 578 ; also see : Thomas Dana V. State of Punjab,
AIR 1959 SC 375.
(ii) It is asserted that the validity of the PMLA shall have to be judged in the background of
international development and obligation of India to prevent money-laundering, as money-
laundering impacts not only the country in which the predicate offence takes place, but also the
economy of other countries where "proceeds of crime" is laundered.
(iii) It is submitted that the object of the PMLA which affect the economic fabric of the nation, is to
prevent money-laundering, regulate certain activities relatable to money-laundering, confiscate the
"proceeds of crime" and the property derived therefrom and punish the offenders. The development
of international consensus towards the offence of money-laundering has been highlighted. It is
submitted that prior to 1988, there was no concept of "proceeds of crime" and the same was
recognized for the first time in Regina V. Cuthbertson* by the House of Lords. England was one of
the first countries to take legislative action against proceeds of crime on the recommendations of
the Hodgson Committee by enacting Drug Trafficking Offences Act, 1986 (later replaced by the
Drug Trafficking Act, 1994) which empowered the Courts to confiscate the proceeds of drug
trafficking.
(iv) Later, the Vienna Convention imposed obligation on each participating country to criminalize
offences related to drug trafficking and money-laundering**, to which India is a party.
(v) It is submitted that the provisions of the Palermo Convention were delineated to ensure that
participating countries should have appropriate legislation to prevent money-laundering and
further, the Convention also placed obligation on the participating nations to utilize relevant
international anti-money laundering initiatives in establishing their domestic regulatory and
supervisory regimes.
(vi) Further, it is submitted that on October 31, 2003, the UN General Assembly adopted United
Nations Convention Against Corruption, whose Preamble recognized the importance of preventing,
detecting and deterring international transfers of illicitly acquired assets, and strengthening
international co-operation in asset recovery. The Convention mandated the participating States to
conduct enhanced scrutiny of accounts sought or maintained by politically exposed persons and
their associates and to implement measures to monitor the movement of cash and other
instruments across their

Article 3(1)(a) and (b) of the Vienna Convention, 1988.
borders so that a "paper trail" be created which could assist law enforcement authorities in
investigating the transfers of illicit assets.
(vii) Thus, relying on the international Conventions, the Union of India has submitted that it is the
international obligations of the State to not only recognize the crime of money-laundering but also
to take steps for preventing the same.
(viii) To highlight the role played by the FATF in combating the menace of money-laundering, the
respondent has traced the origin of FATF and stated its process of reviewing the compliance with its
recommendations by every State and the consequences of non-compliance. It is submitted that the
FATF was established by the Heads of State or Government of the seven major industrial nations
(Group of Seven, G-7) joined by the President of the European Commission in a summit in Paris in
July, 1989 which is famous for its "Forty Recommendations" to combat money-laundering and,
hence, carry out its own evaluation and enforcement on the issue of money-laundering across the
world. Thus, it acts as a dedicated body dealing with this issue. It is submitted that FATF has
recognized dynamic nature of money-laundering and thus attempted to respond to the money-
laundering techniques that are constantly evolving, by reviewing its recommendations. Further, the
FATF has adopted its Non-Co-operative Countries or Territories ("NCCT") initiative in a report issued
on February 14, 2020, according to which a 25 points criteria was recognized which is consistent
with the Forty Recommendations of the FATF and which identified "detrimental rules and practices"
in the international effort to combat laundering. It thus established a review process to target
delinquent countries and territories where the anti- laundering regime is ineffective in practice and
to take steps against those countries. The steps which FATF may take against a non-compliant
nation include "conditioning, restricting, targeting or even prohibiting financial transactions with
non-co-operative jurisdictions".
(ix) It is submitted that the measures against money-laundering have evolved over the period of
time. Further, FATF has taken preventive, regulatory and monitoring steps through keeping a watch
on suspicious or doubtful transactions by amending its Forty Recommendations in 2003 and 2012.
(x) It is further submitted that FATF assess the progress of its members in complying with the
FATF recommendations through assessments performed annually by the individual members and
through mutual evaluations which provides an in-depth description and analysis of a country's
system for preventing criminal abuse of the financial system, as well as, by focused
recommendations to the country to further strengthen its system.
(xi) It is submitted that upon evaluation, a country will be placed immediately into enhanced follow
-up if it does not comply with the FATF technical and "big six" recommendations or has a low
effectiveness outcome*.
(xii) It is further submitted that jurisdictions under monitoring then, based on their commitments
and compliances, are put in two types of list viz., grey list and black list, which serve as a signal to
the global financial and banking system about heightened risks in transactions with the country in
question which not only severely affect its international reputation but also impose economic
challenges, such as impacting the bond/credit market of the country, impacting the banking and
financial sector of the country, affecting cross-border capital flows, especially for the trade sector,
documentary requirements for export and import payments, such as letters of credit may become
more challenging to fulfil, potentially raising costs and hampering business for companies engaged
in trade, adversely affecting the economy due to a lack of investment opportunities which may
further deteriorate the financial health of the country and the country may also be deemed as a
"high-risk country".
(xiii) Further, the learned Solicitor General has relied on a report by the International Monetary
Fund** (IMF)-Anti-Money Laundering and Combating the Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT) Report
on the effectiveness of the program to state the potential economic effects that may arise from
such financial crimes, such as destabilizing capital inflows and outflows, loss of access to
international financial markets as a result of deterioration in the country's reputation, difficulty in
supervising financial institutions, undermining of the stability of a country's financial system and
adverse effect on growth of the country.
(xiv) The respondent has further relied on Council of Europe Convention on Laundering, Search,
Seizure and Confiscation of the Proceeds from Crime and on the Financing of Terrorism (2005) to
state
*
(i) It has 8 or more Non-compliant (NC)/Partially Compliant (PC) ratings for technical
compliance ; (ii) It is rated NC/PC on any one or more of R. 3, 5, 10, 11 and 20 "big six"
recommendations ; or (iii) It has a low level of effectiveness for 4 or more of the 11 effectiveness
outcomes.
For short, "IMF".
that nations are free to choose the definition of "predicate offences" for money-laundering purposes
from the list of offences given under the Convention, for example, by providing a list of those
offences, a category offences, or by reference to offences that have a maximum term of
imprisonment of one year or more (or, for states that have minimum thresholds for offences, those
with imprisonment of a minimum of six months) and to take measures which are preventive in
nature.
(xv) To illustrate the global development of the approach against money-laundering, 1991 Money
Laundering Directive ("First Directive") adopted by the European Union is cited which imposed
obligations on credit institutions and financial institutions in relation to customer identification and
record-keeping, internal controls and training of staff and mandatory reporting of suspicious
transactions. The Second Directive (2001) widened the number of institutions that fell within the
scope of reporting obligations and also expanded the range of predicate offences for the purpose of
money-laundering. EU Third Directive (2005) was directed to bring the EU legislation into line with
the revisions to the FATF Recommendations and further expanded the range of institutions within
its scope to include life insurance intermediaries and widened the definition of high value dealers to
capture those who accept cash payments of €15,000 or more. A definition of "serious crimes" was
included that constituted "predicate offences", including all offences punishable by a maximum
sentence of one year or more, or a minimum sentence of six months or more (in jurisdictions where
minimum sentences are applied), as well as other specified offences including serious fraud and
corruption. It is submitted that the EU Fourth Directive on Money Laundering (2015) aimed to
improve the regulatory European framework after taking into account new FATF recommendations
published in 2012.
(xvi) It is further submitted that the purpose of December 1988 Statement on Prevention of
Criminal Use of the Banking System for the Purpose of Money-Laundering issued by the Basel
Committee was to ensure that banks are not used to hide or launder funds acquired through
criminal activities.
(xvii) To emphasize on the role of international co-operation to combat money-laundering, it has
been stated that the Financial Intelligence Unit created by the Egmont Group, which is an
international forum to combat money-laundering, should serve as a national centre for receiving,
analyzing and disseminating suspicious transaction reports, and should have access on a timely
basis to the financial, administrative and law enforcement information that it requires to properly
undertake its functions as per the revised FATF Recommendations.
(xviii) The Union of India has further traced the origin of the term "money-laundering" and stated
that the term arose in United States in 1920s, which was used by the American Police Officers with
reference to the ownership and use of launderettes by mafia groups as the launderettes gave them
a means of giving a legitimate appearance to money derived from criminal activities. The profits
gained through these launderettes were thus termed "laundered". Further, the term "money-
laundering" was first used with a legal meaning in an American judgment of 1982 concerning the
confiscation of laundered Columbian drug proceeds.
(xix) It is further submitted that the goal of money-laundering is to conceal the predicate offences
and to ensure that the criminals "enjoy" their proceeds. Further, the money-laundering takes place
through "a complex process often using the latest technology, of sanitizing money in such a
manner that its true nature, source or use is concealed, thereby creating an apparent justification
for controlling or possessing the laundered money" in a number of intermediate steps.
(xx) It is stated that the reasons for fighting money-laundering, firstly, is to enable law
enforcement authorities to confiscate the proceeds of predicate criminal activities so as to
undermine organized crime by taking away the incentive for these criminal activities relatable to
offences. Secondly, to apprehend high level criminals as they themselves stay aloof from criminal
activities but do come into contact with the proceeds of these activities, thereby creating a "paper
trail". Thirdly, to prevent criminals from destabilizing the national economy because of its
corruptive influence on financial markets and the reduction of the public's confidence in the
international financial system and lastly to deter the money launderers from impacting the growth
rate of the world economies.
(xxi) It is stated that the principal sources of illegal proceeds are collar crimes (tax, fraud,
corporate crimes, embezzlement and intellectual property crimes), drug related crimes and
smuggling of goods, evasion of excise duties, corruption and bribery (and the embezzlement of
public funds).
(xxii) To show the global impact of money-laundering, it is submitted that the IMF and the FATF
have estimated that the scale of money-laundering transactions is between 2 per cent. and 5 per
cent. of the global GDP. It is also stated that the United Nations has recently put the figure of
money-laundering at USD 2.1 trillion or 3.6 per cent. of global GDP. Thus, the operation of money-
laundering has international dimension. It is submitted that measures being taken at the national
level would be inadequate, which made it necessary to establish effective international co-operation
mechanisms to allow national authorities to co-operate in the prevention and prosecution of money-
laundering and in international "proceeds-hunting".
(xxiii) Further, it is submitted that the measures to combat money- laundering have evolved from
post facto criminalization to preventive approach with its stress on the reporting obligations. The
definition of "money-laundering" is now no more restricted to the elements of projection and
untainted property.
(xxiv) It is stated that India, and its version of the PMLA, is "merely a cog in this international
vehicle" and as India is a signatory to these treaties, therefore, is bound legally and morally, to
adopt the best global practices and respond to the changing needs of the times. It is, therefore,
submitted that the constitutionality of the PMLA has to be adjudicated from the stand point of the
country's obligations and evolving responsibilities internationally.
(xxv) The learned Solicitor General invited our attention to the introduction to the PMLA. Making
reference to the Statement of Objects and Reasons of the Act, he submits that the Act was enacted
with the intent of establishing a strict and stringent framework to address the global menace of
money-laundering. Refuting the private parties' attempt to classify the Act as being a purely penal
statute, he submits that the PMLA is an amorphous or hybrid statute, which has regulatory,
preventive and penal aspects. Learned Solicitor General then walked us through the various
provisions of the PMLA, and submitted that categorizing the Act as being merely penal in nature,
would not only defeat the purpose of the Act, but would also be against the express provisions
enshrined therein.
(xxvi) It is further submitted by the Union of India that the PMLA is a complete Code in itself, and
establishes a specific separate procedure to the extent necessary and to be followed in proceedings
under the Act. Laying down a brief summary of the legislative scheme of the Act, the respondent
submits that there has been a conscious legislative departure from conventional penal law in India.
Considering the peculiar nature of money-laundering-which requires prevention, regulation and
prosecution, a completely different scheme is framed by the Legislature. The new scheme
introduced for dealing with the money-laundering is as a part of India's global responsibility in
international law. While complying with the mandate of FATF, the Legislature has very consciously
ensured that the Act becomes compliant with the Constitution of India. Referring to the rules
formulated under the PMLA, it is also submitted that the scheme of the Act and rules framed
thereunder prescribe an elaborate procedure to ensure complete confidentiality, and place sufficient
in-built checks and balances to prevent potential abuse.
(xxvii) The respondent then sheds some light on the offences being investigated by the Directorate
of Enforcement. It is submitted that the number of cases taken up for investigation each year has
risen from 111 cases in 2015-16 to 981 in 2020-21. Comparing the number of cases registered
annually under money-laundering legislations, it is submitted that the low registration of cases in
India is due to the robust mechanism for risk-based selection of cases for investigation. The ED is
focusing its attention on cases involving high value of proceeds of crime and cases involving serious
predicate offence involving terror financing, narcotics, corruption, offence involving national
security, etc. To that effect, it is highlighted that attachment proceedings concerning some of the
fugitives, who are facing action, were done and assets worth Rs. 19,111.20 crores out of a total
fraud of Rs. 22,585.83 crores were attached. Furthermore, the investigation in 57 cases of terror
and Naxal financing has resulted in identification of proceeds of crime worth over Rs. 1,249 crores
and attachment of proceeds of crime of Rs. 982 crores (256 properties) and filing of 37 prosecution
complaints and conviction of two terrorists under the PMLA. Lastly, it is stated that the quantum of
proceeds of crime involved in the bunch of cases under the PMLA which are under consideration in
these matters is Rs. 67,104 crores.
(xxviii) Having laid down the basic scheme of the PMLA, learned Solicitor General proceeded to
discuss the definition of "money-laundering" as per section 3 of the Act. Tracing its origin, it is
submitted that the term "money-laundering" finds its initial definition in article 3.1(b)(i)(ii) and (c)
(i) of the Vienna Convention. However, the Vienna Convention limited the predicate offences to
drug trafficking offences,
and, consequently, led to the adoption of an expansive definition covering the widest range of
predicate offences under the Palermo Convention. Building upon the definitions contained in the
Vienna Convention and the Palermo Convention, the FATF recommended member countries to
expand the predicate offences to include serious crimes. The same was made binding on the
member countries by way of Recommendation No. 1 and Recommendation No. 3 of the FATF.
Subsequent to its enactment, the PMLA became subject to evaluation by the FATF based on the
Forty Recommendations formulated by the FATF. In 2010, the FATF adopted the "Mutual Evaluation
of the Anti- Money Laundering (AML) and Combating the Financing of Terrorism (CFT) Regime of
India Report"* As per Recommendation No. 1 of the Mutual Evaluation Report, the concealment,
possession, disposition and use of proceeds of crime were not criminalized by the PMLA, and India
was, thus, held to be not fully compliant. Thus, with a view to address the legal deficiency as
pointed out by FATF and to make it globally compliant, the Prevention of Money-Laundering
(Amendment) Act, 2012 amended section 3 to include these activities. In support of his argument,
learned Solicitor General draws our attention to the Statement of Object and Reasons of Prevention
of Money Laundering (Amendment) Bill, 2011**, and parliamentary debates surrounding the
amendment.
(xxix) Summing up the recommendations of the FATF, it is clarified by the learned Solicitor General
that even in an act of mere concealment, mere possession or mere use of "proceeds of crime" or
"activity" connected with the proceeds of crime, per se, is an offence. In other words, if a person
conceals the proceeds of crime, keeps it in his possession or uses it, he is guilty of money-
laundering irrespective of as to whether he is projecting it as untainted or not. This is for the simple
reason that if a person conceals something (proceeds of crime), it is an act committed knowingly
and, thus, the question of that person projecting that very thing either as tainted or untainted does
not arise.
(xxx) It is further explained that the anomaly resulting from an erroneous drafting was successfully
explained during the 2013 review of FATF by categorically contending that all expressions following
the term "including" are mere illustrative and independently constitute an offence of money-
laundering without being dependent upon each
* For short, "Mutual Evaluation Report".
For short, "2011 Bill".
other. Thus, so long as a person knowingly becomes a party or is actually involved in any process or
activity connected with proceeds of crime, such a person is guilty of money-laundering.
(xxxi) In order to lend further credibility to the sanctity of the FATF Mutual Evaluation Report and
the recommendations contained therein, the learned Solicitor General took us through the
numerous amendments incorporated in the PMLA by way of the 2012 Amendment Act which was
largely based on the recommendation of the FATF. Special emphasis is laid on the amendments
carried out in sections 5 and 8 of the Act pursuant to the FATF recommendations. It is further
submitted that apart from the PMLA, corresponding amendments to the UAPA, the NDPS Act and
the Companies Act have been also made as a sequel to the FATF recommendation during the
Mutual Evaluation of India.
(xxxii) Learned Solicitor General submitted that the interpretation put forth by the other side,
would effectively result in granting the accused a license to commit the offence of money-
laundering and thereafter either conceal the proceeds of crime, or keep them in his possession, or
use them and thereby wriggle out of the legislative intent of preventing money-laundering by
raising a plea that the same were never claimed/projected as being untainted property. Reliance is
placed on Seaford Court Estates Ld. V. Asher*, to point out that principles of statutory
interpretation dictate that any interpretation which leads to mischief should be avoided and the
statute should be so construed that the legislative intent is not defeated. It is submitted that the
limitations of traditional approach to crime and in fact, highlights the importance of the evolved
approach of anti-money laundering laws in the nature of the PMLA. Thus, the definition of "money-
laundering" as it exists, passes the muster, both under articles 14 and 21 of the Constitution of
India.
(xxxiii) It is further submitted that the Explanation to section 3 inserted vide Finance (No. 2) Act,
2019, is merely clarificatory in nature and elucidates the legislative intent behind the provision.
Reliance is placed on the background/justification of the amendments to PMLA as contained in the
debate on the Finance Bill, 2019**
(xxxiv) Strong emphasis is laid on the use of the word "any" in the phrase "any process or activity".
A careful reading of section 3 of the PMLA clearly provides that any process or activity which itself
has a
* (1949) 2 KB 481.
For short, "2019 Bill".
wider meaning also includes the process or activity of concealment, possession, acquisition, use
and/or projecting, claiming it as untainted property. Placing reliance on Shri Balaganesan Metals V.
M. N. Shanmugham Chetty*, it is submitted that all or every type/species of process or activity
connected with proceeds of crime shall be included while interpreting the nature of process or
activities connected with the proceeds of crime.
(xxxv) It is further submitted that all and any activities relating to proceeds of crime including
solitary-possession, concealment, use or acquisition, constitute and offence of money-laundering,
independent of the final projection. It is submitted that such an interpretation is necessary to
effectively implement the Act in its true spirit. It is submitted that considering the definition
prevailing in India, it is necessary that any and all of the activity or process occurring in the
definition after the word "including" is considered to be merely illustrative and not restrictive.
Reliance is placed on catena of judgments** to show that the use of the term "including" is not
restrictive, but rather further enlarges the scope of the definition.
(xxxvi) Depending upon the facts of the case, he submits that it is quite likely that accused of
money-laundering may fall in more than one of the above categories. Therefore, the focus of
investigation should be on identification of all the process or activity connected with proceeds of
crime including the specific processes and activities, which have been included as illustrations in
section 3. Reliance is placed on Rohit Tandon V. Directorate of Enforcement* , to bring forth the
interplay between various aspects of section 3 of the PMLA.
(xxxvii) The learned Solicitor General has also cited other authorities including the observations
made by this court in Kartar Singh V. State of Punjab#, R. Sai Bharathi V. J. Jayalalitha## and
Subramanian
502 ; Oswal Fats and Oils Limited V. Additional Commissioner(Administration), Bareilly Division,
Swamy V. Union of India*, to show that it is the sole prerogative of the Legislature to define a
"crime", and it is this definition that should be at the center of any challenge to a criminal
provision.
(xxxviii) It is urged that the "projection" of proceeds of crime cannot be held as a mandatory
requirement under section 3 of the Act ; otherwise, it will become impossible to punish a person for
the offence of money-laundering who "knowingly assists" or who is "knowingly a party" or who is
"actually involved" in any process or activity connected with the proceeds of crime. It is, therefore,
submitted that the correct interpretation of the word "and" should be "or" as it was always intended
by the Legislature. Further, it is stated that any interpretation contrary to this will render the
provision meaningless. To bolster this argument, reliance is placed on the decision of this court in
Sanjay Dutt V. State through C.B.I., Bombay**, In that case the court held that the word "and"
should be interpreted as "or" and the words "arms and ammunition" should not be read
conjunctively ; otherwise, the object of the Act will be defeated. Therefore, on a similar line, it is
argued that mere concealment or use or possession of the proceeds of crime would amount to an
offence of money-laundering and any other interpretation of the section would be contrary to the
India's international obligation and FATF recommendations. It is submitted that such interpretation
of the word "and" would not amount to judicial legislation, as such exercise is only done to give
effect to the legislative intent by correcting "faultiness of expression"* He has relied on Joint
Directors of Mines Safety V. Tandur and Nayandgi Stone Quarries (P) Ltd.# to contend that the
word "and" was interpreted as "or" by the court to give effect to the legislative intent of the Mines
Act, 1952##.
(xxxix) Emphasis is also laid on the application of international law while interpreting domestic law
and it is stated that the domestic courts are under an obligation to give due regard to the
international Conventions for construing domestic laws## The learned Solicitor General has
further placed reliance on People's Union for Civil Lib
Regina V. Oakes (1959) 2 QB 350, Ishwar Singh Bindra V. State of U. P. (1969) 1 SCR 219 and
# # For short, "Mines Act".
erties V. Union of India* and Githa Hariharan V. Reserve Bank of India** to submit that the
international Treaties and Conventions may be relied on by the domestic courts so as to give effect
to the international law, if such law is not inconsistent with any domestic law.
(xl) While referring to sections 4 and 5 of the Cr. P. C., it is urged that Cr.P.C is a generic
procedural law with no universal application over any other special criminal or penal legislations. It
is stated that the Legislature is competent to provide a different procedure than that of the Cr.P.C,
provided that the special procedure has adequate constitutional safeguards. Therefore, it is
submitted that Parliament has provided a distinct procedure under the PMLA which is also
manifested from sections 65 and 71 of the PMLA. It is stated that due to the peculiar nature of the
offence of money-laundering, the Legislature in its wisdom has provided a special procedure for
investigation and trial of the offence under the Act. However, it is submitted that where the
application of the Cr. P. C. is not expressly or by necessary implication excluded, the provisions of
the Cr. P. C. will apply in light of section 65 of the PMLA as well.
(xli) It is argued that the PMLA is a complete Code in itself, which creates a new offence and
provides separate machinery to the extent necessary for dealing with it. Therefore, the provisions of
PMLA would override the provisions of the Cr. P. C. in relation to such express dispensation in view
of section 71 of this (PMLA) Act. In support of this argument, reliance is placed on Rohtas V. State
of Haryana***, Ajmer Singh V. Union of India#, Usmanbhai Dawoodbhai Memon V. State of
Gujarat##, Central Bureau of Investigation V. State of Rajasthan### State (Union of India) V.
Ram Saran*#, Mahmadhusen Abdulrahim Kalota Shaikh V. Union of India#*, Lalita Kumari V.
Government of Uttar Pradesh*#* Gautam Kundu V. Directorate of Enforcement (Prevention of
Money-Laundering Act)**# and Union of India V. Chandra Bhushan Yadav.#
(xlii) Next, it is argued that wording of section 71 must be given effect to. It is asserted that the
insertion of a non-obstante clause in a statute has the effect of overriding anything inconsistent or
repugnant thereto*. It is stated that this court in Deep Chand V. State of Uttar Pradesh* laid down
some tests for determining whether any inconsistency or repugnancy exists between two statutes.
The court held that it has to be seen whether the provisions are in direct conflict with each other ;
whether the legislative intent was to lay down an exhaustive Code on the subject matter and
thereby replace the previous law and whether the two legislations operate in the same field.
(xliii) It is argued that when a statute has expressly provided a repealing section then the maxim
"est exclusio alterius" (the express intention of one person or thing is the exclusion of another) will
apply, thereby application of existing statute is excluded in case of any inconsistency between the
two***.
(xliv) Reliance has also been placed on Innoventive Industries Limited V. ICICI Bank#, wherein in
respect of a similar provision in the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016##, it was held that the
provisions of the stated Code ought to be given primacy over other statutes. It is, therefore,
submitted that the procedure under the Cr. P. C. to the extent of inconsistent proviso in PMLA,
stands excluded by way of section 71 of the Act by necessary implication. The doctrine of "generalia
specialibus non derogant", has also been invoked, which means that general law yields to special
law. Reliance is placed on the decision of House of Lords in Elizabeth Warburton V. James
Loveland## It is submitted that the said decision has been followed in Patna Improvement Trust
V. Smt. Lakshmi Devi*#, South India Corporation (P) Ltd. V. Secretary, Board of Revenue#*,
Anandji Haridas and Co. (P) Ltd. V. S. P. Kasture*#* Maharashtra State Board of Secondary and

(xlv) It is then submitted that the controversies regarding offence under the Act being cognizable
or non-cognizable is irrelevant because the definitions of the cognizable offence under section 2(c)
and non-cognizable offence under section 2(I) of the Cr. P. C. are clearly inapplicable in the case of
ED officers who are not police officers*, as these two definitions only apply to "police officer".
Secondly, the application of these two definitions is restricted to the offences mentioned under the
First Schedule of the Cr. P. C. and the offence under the Act (PMLA) is clearly not an offence
specified therein. It is submitted that even under Part II of the First Schedule, the offence under
the Act would be cognizable. Further, the purpose of categorizing an offence on the basis of
cognizable and non-cognizable offence is to indicate whether a police officer can arrest a person
without warrant. The Act under section 19 confers unequivocal power of arrest without warrant.
Therefore, the question as to whether an offence of money-laundering is cognizable or non-
cognizable, is irrelevant.
(xlvi) It is submitted that from the very inception of the PMLA, the offences were made cognizable
under section 45 of the Act. However, the word "cognizable" was causing unnecessary confusion, as
it seemed that offence being cognizable, the jurisdictional police officers are also empowered to
investigate the offence and submit chargesheet after the investigation. Although such confusion
had no basis as only the ED officers have been empowered to conduct investigation, who are not
police officers under the Act, and after the investigation only a complaint could be filed by him
before the Special Court. To remove this anomaly, the word "cognizable" was deleted and the
definition of investigation was inserted under section 2(1)(na) of the Act. In this regard, the
learned Solicitor General has cited relevant extracts of speech of then Finance Minister while
introducing 2019 amendment.
(xlvii) It is submitted that the Legislature had no intention to make the offence under the PMLA to
be non-cognizable which is manifest from the unamended marginal note** of sections 19 and 45 of
the Act. It is further stated that section 19 of the PMLA has a special purpose with regard to the
peculiar nature of the offence. It is then submitted that the Legislature has deliberately avoided the
provision of
* Ramesh Chandra Mehta (1969) 2 SCR 461 ; AIR 1970 SC 940.
registration of FIR, supplying the copy of FIR to the Magistrate and requiring the authorities to
obtain arrest warrant because due to the nature of offence, there are high chances that the accused
may eliminate the traces of offence if he had any prior notice of the investigation. The same view
has been taken by the Jharkhand High Court in Hari Narayan Rai V. Union of India*, Punjab and
Haryana High Court at Chandigarh in Karam Singh V. Union of India**, Bombay High Court in
Chhagan Chandrakant Bhujbal V. Union of India***, Delhi High Court in Vakamulla Chandrashekhar

However, in W. P. (Crl.) No. 363 of 2018 and Crl. M. A. No. 2151 of 2018, i. e., Rajbhushan
Omprakash Dixit V. Union of India, the Division Bench of the High Court took a different view and
referred the matter to a Larger Bench. It is submitted that the said order is contrary to the
decisions of this court in Serious Fraud Investigation Office V. Rahul Modi#* and of the High Courts.
(xlviii) Further, the binary created by the private parties of an offence being cognizable or non-
cognizable is immaterial in the case of PMLA, which is a Code in itself and provides a special
procedure for investigation. It is argued that the compartmentalization of the offence under the Act
is pointless because if the offence is held to be cognizable, then it will be mandatory to register an
FIR. However, under the scheme of the PMLA, only an ECIR is registered, which cannot be equated
with an FIR and it is only for administrative convenience for identification of each case.
(xlix) It is argued that the decision of this court in K. I. Pavunny V. Assistant Collector (HQ),
Central Excise Collectorate*#*, squarely applies to the present case, wherein it had been held that
Chapter XII of the Cr. P. C. will not apply during the investigations under the 1962 Act.

Order dated January 4, 2018 in SLP (Crl.) Diary No. 36918 of 2017.
(I) It is submitted that various High Courts have already answered the question under
consideration and held that the offence under the Act is cognizable, so far as power of arrest
without warrant is concerned and the ECIR registered under the Act cannot be equated with an
FIR*. Strong reliance has been placed upon the decisions in Virbhadra Singh (supra) and Dalmia
Cement (Bharat) Limited V. Assistant Director of Enforcement Directorate**
(li) It is submitted that the nature of the amendment can only be inferred from the scheme of the
Act prior to the amendment and subsequent to the amendment, and it is the substance rather than
the form which determines the nature of the Act. To lend support to his submissions, learned
Solicitor General has relied on Zile Singh V. State of Haryana and CIT V. Gold Coin Health
Food
Private Limited.#
(lii) It is argued that the amendment of section 45 only clarifies that the offence under the Act is
cognizable in nature so far as the power of arrest without warrant is concerned. It is further
submitted that the amendment being clarificatory in nature would operate retrospectively. To
bolster this argument, reliance has been placed on CIT V. Shelly Products## Gurcharan Singh V.
Directorate of Revenue Intelligence### Assistant Electrical Engineer V. Satyendra Raj*# CIT V.
Vatika Township Private Limited#* State Bank of India V. V. Ramakrishnan*# and Union of India
V. Mudrika Singh**#.
(liii) It is then submitted that there are adequate safeguards under section 19 of the PMLA, which
makes the provision Constitution- compliant. It is submitted that firstly, the power of arrest under
section 19 can be exercised only by a Director, Deputy Director, Assistant Director or any other
police officer authorized in this behalf by the Central Government as opposed to the Cr. P. C., where
the power of arrest can be exercised by any police officer without a warrant even on the basis of
reasonable suspicion, as per section 41 of the Cr. P. C. The Director, who is the head of ED, is
appointed by a neutral process
Bom 9938.
mentioned under section 25 of the Central Vigilance Commission Act. 2003*. Therefore. only
persons of particular rank who are appointed by statute have the power to arrest any person under
section 19 of the PMLA. Secondly, there must be material in possession with the Authority before
the power of arrest can be exercised as opposed to the Cr. P. C. which gives the power of arrest to
any police officer and the officer can arrest any person merely on the basis of a complaint, credible
information or reasonable suspicion against such person. Thirdly, there should be reason to believe
that the person being arrested is guilty of the offence punishable under the PMLA in contrast to the
provision in Cr. P. C., which mainly requires reasonable apprehension/suspicion of commission of
offence. Also, such reasons to believe must be reduced in writing. Fifthly, as per the constitutional
mandate of article 22(1), the person arrested is required to be informed of the grounds of his
arrest. It is submitted that the argument of the other side that the accused or arrested persons are
not even informed of the case against them, is contrary to the plain language of the Act, as the Act
itself mandates that the person arrested is to be informed of the ground of his arrest. Sixthly, the
Authority arresting the person is required to forward a copy of the order of arrest and material in its
possession to the Adjudicatory Authority in a sealed envelope, which is required to be retained for a
period of ten (10) years as per the Prevention of Money Laundering (the Forms and Manner of
Forwarding a Copy of Order of Arrest of a Person along with the Material to the Adjudicating
Authority and its Period of Retention) Rules, 2005. Seventhly, it is stated that the person arrested
is required to be produced before the Special Court or the Magistrate within twenty-four hours of
his arrest. Thus, the competent Court can look at the material in possession of the Director and the
reasons formed by him to believe that the person is guilty of the offence under the PMLA, so as to
satisfy itself of the legality of his arrest.
(liv) It is submitted that as there is nothing contrary in the PMLA to section 167 of the Cr. P. C.,
therefore, the provisions of remand under section 167 of the Cr. P. C. would also apply and any
further detention of the arrested person would only be allowed by the competent court and, for the
same reasons, Chapter V of the Cr. P. C. would also apply in case of arrest made under the PMLA.
(Iv) Further, it is submitted that the guidelines issued in Arnesh Kumar V. State of Bihar** will
have no application for the purpose of
* For short, "CVC Act".
arrest under the PMLA. The guidelines in the said decision were issued to avoid misuse of the
provision of arrest, while in the case of the PMLA, there is already a higher threshold specified for
arresting any person. Therefore, there is no possibility of arbitrary arrest under the PMLA. Whereas,
since the decision to arrest is taken by the high official after complying with threshold requirements
in law, there will be presumption that he has acted bona fide.
(Ivi) It is stated that considering the nature and gravity of the offence, the serving of notice to a
person as prescribed under section 41A of the Cr. P. C. would materially interfere with fair
investigation being done by the high official bestowed with such responsibility and make the
investigation redundant.
(Ivii) Further, it is submitted that the contention of the private parties that the power under section
19 of the PMLA can only be invoked after a complaint is filed, is devoid of any merits. It is
submitted that in a complaint case under the PMLA, a complaint is similar to the police report filed
under section 173 of the Cr.P.C, which makes the arrest a part of investigation which would always
be prior to filing of the complaint under section 44 or further complaint as contemplated in
Explanation in section 44. Further, the proviso to section 44(1)(b) which provides for filing of a
closure report before the Special Court, if after investigation no offence of money-laundering is
made out, makes it absolutely clear that the complaint is to be filed after the conclusion of
investigation.
(Iviii) It is submitted that section 19 of the PMLA is pari materia to section 35 of the FERA and
section 103 of the 1962 Act and their validity has been upheld by this court. Reliance is placed on
Ramesh Chandra Mehta (supra) to urge that the filing of complaint, after the investigation, is not a
necessary prerequisite before arresting the person.
(lix) Reliance is then placed on the decision of this court in Union of India V. Padam Narain
Aggarwal*, wherein the court examined the power to arrest under section 104 of the 1962 Act.
Relying on the decision, it was stated that the power to arrest is statutory in character and cannot
be interfered with and can only be exercised on objective considerations free from whims, caprice
or fancy of the officer. The law takes due care to ensure individual freedom and liberty by laying
down norms and providing safeguards so that the authorities may not
misuse such power. It is submitted that the requirement of "reason to believe" and "recording of
such reasons in writing" prevent arbitrariness and makes the provision compliant with article 14.
This is reinforced from the fact that only 313 arrests have been made under the PMLA in 17 years of
operations of the PMLA.
(Ix) Canadian judgment in Gifford V. Kelson* was also relied on to state that "reason to believe"
conveys conviction of the mind founded on evidence regarding the existence of a fact or the doing
of an act, therefore, is of a higher standard than mere suspicion. Reliance has been further placed
on Premium Granites V. State of T. N. to urge that the requirement of giving reasons for exercise
of the power by itself excludes chances of arbitrariness. The learned Solicitor General has further
relied on the decision in Sukhwinder Pal Bipan Kumar V. State of Punjab*** to state that there is
a
presumption that the discretion will not be abused where the discretion is vested with a high-
ranking officer. Lastly, reliance was placed on Ahmed Noormohmed Bhatti V. State of Gujarat# and
Manzoor Ali Khan V. Union of India# to urge that mere possibility of abuse by the authority, which
is vested with the discretion to exercise the power, cannot be a ground to render the provision
unconstitutional.
(Ixi) It is then submitted that the quantum of punishment cannot be the sole basis for determining
the gravity of offence. The Legislature has several statutory mechanisms to bring about deterrence
effect so as to prevent the commission of an offence and the quantum of punishment is only one
such mechanism. It is further submitted that a stringent condition of bail is relatable to the object
of creating a deterrent effect on persons who may commit the offence of money- laundering which
is also manifest in the Preamble of the Act. To give effect to the international standards of
preventing money-laundering prescribed by FATF and other international treaties, stringent bail
conditions are necessary and the Legislature has provided enough safeguards under section 19 so
as to balance the rights of the accused and to protect the interest of the investigation as well. It is
urged that the legislative policy of the country has consistently treated money- laundering as a
serious offence affecting the microeconomic strength of the country. Further, it is stated that the
twin conditions under
* (1943) 51 Man. R 120.
section 45 of the PMLA are reasonable from the stand point of the accused and his rights under
article 21 of the Constitution, which provides an objective criteria and intelligible differentia, hence,
does not violate article 14 of the Constitution. Further it is submitted that there are only some
issues on which the international community is building consensus and money-laundering is one of
them, others being terrorism, drug related offences and organized crime and the twin conditions
are provided in all three categories of laws by the Legislature.
(Ixii) Relying on international Conventions, such as Vienna Convention, Palermo Convention and
FATF Recommendations, it is urged that the same concern has been expressed by the global
community, which is reflected in all the above-mentioned Conventions. It is further submitted that
section 45 of the PMLA fulfils the mandate of international Conventions as the implementation of
the PMLA is monitored internationally and is linked to India's international obligations.
(Ixiii) It is submitted that in furtherance of the legitimate State interest, departure from ordinary
criminal procedure has been made under the PMLA. Reliance has been placed on A. K. Roy V. Union
of India* to urge that that "the liberty of the individual has to be subordinated, within reasonable
bounds, to the good of the people". Further, the twin conditions are not novel or draconian in
nature as they are also present in other numerous special enactments for the welfare of the people
and they not only provide deterrent effect but also tackle the offence of money-laundering. It is
submitted that this court in Nikesh Tarachand Shah (supra) has not reckoned this crucial aspect. It
is submitted that the length of punishment is not the only indicator of the gravity of the offence
and private parties have wrongly argued that the twin conditions cannot be made applicable in a
legislation which carry a punishment of only seven (7) years. Gravity of offence is to be judged on a
totality of factors, especially keeping in mind the background in which the offence came to be
recognized by the Legislature in the specific international context. To buttress this submission, the
learned Solicitor General has relied on State of Gujarat V. Mohanlal Jitamalji Porwal**, Y. S.
Jaganmohan Reddy V. Central Bureau of Investigation*** Nimmagadda Prasad V. Central Bureau
of Investigation#, Gautam Kundu (supra) and State of
Bihar V. Amit Kumar alias Bachcha Rai*. Further, reliance has been placed on Mohd. Hanif Quareshi
V. State of Bihar** to state that the seriousness of an offence and its impact on society is the
subject matter of legislative wisdom and the Legislature understands and correctly appreciates the
needs of its own people.
(Ixiv) It is submitted that persons involved in the offence of money- laundering are influential,
intelligent and resourceful and the crime is committed with full pre-meditation, which ensures that
the offence is not detected and even if it is detected, investigation agency cannot trace the
evidence. Further, it is stated that the offence is committed with the help of advanced technology
so as to conceal the transaction, which makes the stringent bail conditions justified. Twin
conditions of bail under section 45 protect the interests of the accused as well as that of the
prosecution. Reliance has been placed on Talab Haji Hussain V. Madhukar Purshottam Mondkar***,
to state that the fair trial must not only be fair to the accused but also be fair to the prosecution, so
that a person guilty of the offence may not be acquitted.
(Ixv) It is submitted that in case of offence of money-laundering, mere routine conditions
which ensure presence of the accused during trial or protect the evidence, are not enough
because of the trans-border nature of the offence of money-laundering and influence which may
be exercised by the accused. An accused can anonymously remove the money trail using the
technology, which is available today so as to make the investigation infructuous. Therefore, even
deposit of the passport of the accused may not deter the accused from fleeing the course of
justice or to eliminate the evidence.
(Ixvi) It is submitted that the economic offences constitute a class apart and need to be
visited with different approach in the matter of bail. Further, the fact that the economic offences
are considered as a different class of offences, recognizes the grave and serious nature of the
offence with deep rooted conspiracy, as they involve huge loss of public funds, thus, affecting
the economy of the country as a whole. It is submitted that the court while granting bail must
keep in mind the nature of accusations, the nature of evidence in support thereof, the severity of
the punishment which conviction will entail, the character of the accused, circumstances which
are peculiar to the accused, reasonable possibility of securing the presence of the accused,
reasonable
AIR 1958 SC 731.
[1958] SCR 1226.
apprehension of the witnesses being tampered with and the larger interests of the
public/State. It is submitted that granting or refusal to grant bail depends on the nature of
offence, needs of investigation, status of the accused and other factors. The Legislature, being
aware of the need of the day, is competent to provide a special procedure for grant of bail. It
would be wrong to say that the court has unfettered discretion in granting or refusal to grant the
bail. It is true that the court exercises discretion while granting or refusing bail, but that exercise
of power has to be within the legislative framework. It is stated that the requirement of the court
being satisfied that the "accused is not guilty of an offence" is not a novel legislative device.
Section 437 of the Cr. P. C. also imposes a similar condition*. Moreover, the twin conditions have
been provided for by Parliament in numerous other enactments as well. It is submitted that
Parliament is competent to classify offences and offenders in different categories. Parliament has
classified the offence of money-laundering as a separate class of offence from ordinary criminal
laws. The said classification was necessary because the PMLA was framed in a specific
international context, providing for separate and special architecture for investigation.
(Ixvii) The offence of money-laundering is a new offence created by the PMLA, which has a
high threshold of arrest as given under section 19, which itself justifies high threshold for grant
of bail. Nature of the offence being peculiar, makes manner of investigation far more difficult
than in ordinary penal offences. The PMLA is a complete code in itself, which creates a separate
machinery to tackle the social menace, having adequate safeguards. It is submitted that the
Legislature has on numerous occasions made departures from the ordinary penal and procedural
laws as and when the situation arrived. The classification of the offence on the basis of public
policy and underlying purpose of the Act cannot be said to be unreasonable or arbitrary.
Therefore, Parliament is fully competent to deal with special type of cases by providing a distinct
and different procedure which in the circumstances, cannot be said to be unreasonable.
Therefore, it is submitted that a different standard for bail can be provided in an

or suspected of, the commission of any non-bailable offence is arrested or detainedwithout warrant

Court or court of session, he may be released on bail, but-(i) such person shall not be so released

offence which serves a special purpose. To buttress these submissions, reliance has been
placed on Kathi Raning Rawat V. State of Saurashtra*, Kedar Nath Bajoria V. State of West
Bengal**, Special Reference No. 1 of 1978*** and Kartar Singh (supra).
(Ixviii) Further reliance has been placed on Asbury Hospital V. Cass County#, Charanjit Lal
Chowdhury V. Union of India# and State of Bombay V. F. N. Balsara## to urge that "the
principle of equality does not mean that every law must have universal application for all persons
who are not by nature, attainment or circumstances in the same position and the varying needs
of different classes of persons often require separate treatment". Therefore, the State has power
to classify persons on the basis of intelligible differentia and object which the legislation seeks to
achieve. It is submitted that the classification of the offence of the PMLA and the stringent
conditions of bail under section 45 are, therefore, not arbitrary and are based on intelligible
differentia in line with the object of the Act which is to bring about deterrence effect.
(Ixix) The learned Solicitor General has further relied on articles 38, 39(b), (c) and 51(b) and
(c) of the Constitution to state that the objective of the Act is to fulfil the mandate of the
Constitution, enshrined in the Directive Principles of State Policy. Reliance has been further
placed on Workmen of Meenakshi Mills Limited V. Meenakshi Mills Ltd.*#, Papnasam Labour
Union V. Madura Coats Ltd.# and MRF Ltd. V. Inspector Kerala Government*#* to state that
Parliament can impose restriction which has the effect of promoting or effectuating a directive
principle and such restriction can be safely presumed to be a reasonable restriction in public
interest. Reliance has also been placed on State of Karnataka V. Shri Ranganatha Reddy**# and
State of Tamil Nadu V. L. Abu Kavur Bai#**, to state that the article 39(b) of the Constitution
shall be given a broad meaning.
(Ixx) It is submitted that the mandatory twin conditions of bail contained in section 45 of the
PMLA prescribe a reasonable restriction
* AIR 1952 SC 123.

which has a reasonable nexus with the object sought to be achieved, viz., creating deterrence
from committing the offence of money-laundering and, therefore, cannot be treated as arbitrary
or unreasonable or violative of article 14 or 21 of the Constitution. Reliance has been placed on
Kartar Singh (supra) and Ranjitsing Brahmajeetsing Sharma V. State of Maharashtra*, wherein
the similar twin conditions were upheld by this court in TADA Act and MCOCA respectively, to
contend that the twin conditions provided under the PMLA are not unreasonable so as to violate
article 21 of the Constitution.
(Ixxi) It is submitted that the limitations on the grant of bail is in addition to those provided
under the Cr. P. C. Reliance has also been placed on Collector of Customs V. Ahmadalieva
Nodira** to urge that the satisfaction contemplated under section 45 regarding the accused
being not guilty has to be based upon "reasonable grounds", which means something more than
prima facie grounds. Further reliance has been placed on Superintendent, Narcotics Control
Bureau, Chennai V. R. Paulsamy***, Union of India V. Gurcharan Singh#, Ahmadalieva Nodira
(supra), Union of India V. Abdulla## Ranjitsing Brahmajeetsing Sharma (supra), Narcotics
Control Bureau V. Karma Phuntsok### Chenna Boyanna Krishna Yadav V. State of
Maharashtra*# N. R. Mon V. Mohd. Nasimuddin#*, State of Maharashtra V. Bharat Shanti Lal
Shah*#*, Union of India V. Rattan Mallik alias Habul**#, State of Maharashtra V. Vishwanath
Maranna Shetty#**, Union of India V. Niyazuddin Sk.##*, Satpal Singh V. State of Punjab*##
National Investigation Agency V. Zahoor Ahmad Shah Watali#*# and Serious Fraud
Investigation Office V. Nittin Johari**## to urge that the twin conditions with regard to the
grant of bail are mandatory in nature, as has already been held by the courts in aforementioned
cases.
(Ixxii) Reliance has also been placed on Modern Dental College and Research Centre V. State
of Madhya Pradesh* to urge that the reasonability of a statute should be seen from the point of
view of general public and not from the point of view of a person on whom the restrictions are
imposed. Reliance has also been placed on Bell V. Wolfish** to argue that detention of a person
does not mean that he has been punished by the Government. Decision in Schall V. Martin***
to state that the legislative intent must be looked at in order to determine whether the
restriction on liberty constitutes "impermissible punishment or permissible regulation".
(Ixxiii) The learned Solicitor General has argued that the decision in Nikesh Tarachand Shah
(supra) was based on the fact that the twin conditions of bail, as per the unamended provision,
would apply to cases of bail in respect of both the predicate offence and also the offence of
money-laundering. It is submitted that the reasons due to which the court in Nikesh Tarachand
Shah (supra) held the twin conditions to be unconstitutional, are firstly because the unamended
provision had a classification which was based on sentencing of the scheduled offence, and
secondly, because the applicability of the twin conditions was restricted only to a particular class
of offences within the PMLA, i. e., offences punishable for a term of imprisonment of more than
three (3) years under Part A of the Schedule and not to all the offences under the PMLA. It is
stated that both the above defects have been removed by the amendment post Nikesh
Tarachand Shah (supra). Therefore, the basis and the element of arbitrariness, as pointed out by
the court in Nikesh Tarachand Shah (supra), has been taken away by Parliament so as to cure
the defect.
(Ixxiv) It is submitted that, concededly, a law which is struck down by the court due to
legislative incompetence can never be made operative by the logic of curing the defect.
However, if a law has been struck down by the court as being violative of Part III of the
Constitution, then the Legislature has the power to cure the reason or defect which persuaded
the Constitutional court to hold it to be violative of Part III of the Constitution and, thereafter,
the provision will be back in its full force, as the declaration by the Constitutional court of the
provision being unconstitutional mainly results in making the provision inoperative and
unenforceable while the provision
441 US 520 [1979].
467 US 253 [1984].
remains on the statute book. To buttress this submission reliance has been placed on Patel
Gordhandas Hargovindas V. Municipal Commissioner*, Shri Prithvi Cotton Mills Ltd. V. Broach
Borough Municipality**, Bhubaneshwar Singh V. Union of India***, Comorin Match Industries
(P.) Ltd. V. State of T. N.#, Indian Aluminium Co. V. State of Kerala## Bakhtawar Trust V. M. D.
Narayan## #, State of Himachal Pradesh V. Narain Singh*#, Goa Foundation V. State of Goa#*
and Cheviti Venkanna Yadav V. State of Telangana**#
(Ixxv) It is further submitted that the judgment of this court in Nikesh Tarachand Shah
(supra) is per incuriam, as the court failed to take note of the judgment of a larger Bench in
Rohit Tandon (supra), which clearly indicated the mandatory nature and reasonability of twin
conditions. Reliance has been placed on Behram Khurshed Pesikaka V. State of Bombay#**, M.
P. V. Sundararamier and Co. V. The State of Andhra Pradesh*# and F. N. Balsara (supra) to
state that a law which is not within the competence of the Legislature is a nullity. However, a law
which is within the competence of the Legislature but repugnant to the constitutional
prohibitions, is only unenforceable and if the prohibitions are removed, then the law will become
effective without any need of re-enactment of the provision. It is submitted that the court in
Deep Chand (supra) was concerned with the doctrine of eclipse and the observation of the court
that such eclipse cannot operate retrospectively and cannot save the validity of the law, was said
in a different context. Further reference has been laid on Jagannath V. Authorised Officer, Land
Reforms#*# to submit that the court in this case negated a similar argument made on the
basis of Deep Chand (supra). It is submitted that the contentions of the private parties based on
the decision in State of Manipur (supra) are totally misconceived, as the court in that case
neither had the intent nor had the occasion to decide the issue of taking away the basis after
declaration of unconstitutionality.
* AIR 1963 SC 1742.
(1955) 1 SCR 613.
(1958) 9 STC 298 (SC) ; [1958] SCR 1422.
(Ixxvi) It is, thus, submitted that the law laid down in Nikesh Tarachand Shah (supra) is per
incuriam. For, it failed to take notice of the international background of the PMLA. Further, the
judgment completely ignores the fact that the economic offences form separate class and the
twin conditions for money-laundering is a reasonable classification. The court had no occasion to
consider the question of "legitimate State interest" in providing for twin conditions for a separate
class of offences.
(Ixxvii) Further, it is submitted that the court was in error to make distinction between
anticipatory bail and regular bail and wrongly restricted the operation of section 45 to post-arrest
bail. It is stated that if it is held that the twin conditions under section 45 are only applicable to
regular bail and not to anticipatory bail, then the provision may not stand the scrutiny on the
touchstone of article 14 of the Constitution. Thus, the finding of the court in paragraph 42 of the
reported decision needs to be overruled. It is submitted that there is no conceptual difference
between anticipatory bail and regular bail and to substantiate this argument, reliance has been
placed on the Sushila Aggarwal V. State (NCT of Delhi)*. It is urged that the observation of this
court in Nikesh Tarachand Shah (supra) about non- applicability of the twin conditions for bail in
case of anticipatory bail should be considered as an obiter dicta. Reliance has been placed on
Municipal Corporation of Delhi V. Gurnam Kaur* to state that the casual expressions of a judge
in the judgment carry no weight at all.
(Ixxviii) It is further submitted that the interpretation of the court in Nikesh Tarachand Shah
(supra) is erroneous, because it ignores the non obstante clause under section 45 which ousts
the applicability of section 438 of the Cr. P. C. The words "anticipatory bail" are not used
separately in the Cr. P. C and pre-arrest bail is mainly a species of bail in the Cr. P. C. Therefore,
it is submitted that section 45 of the PMLA and the conditions mentioned therein govern the
entire subject of bail under the PMLA. It is further submitted that even the Constitutional courts
should be loath to ignore the express mandate of the statute which imposes stringent conditions
of bail on a person accused of an offence under the PMLA.
(Ixxix) Further it is argued that the reliance of the private parties on the decision in Hema
Mishra V. State of Uttar Pradesh** is completely misplaced, as the court in that case was
dealing with the situation
wherein the provision concerning anticipatory bail had been deleted by a local State
enactment, and even in that case, the court held that the power under article 226 of the
Constitution to grant anticipatory bail ought to be exercised in extremely rare circumstances.
Therefore, the said judgment has no applicability in the present case.
(Ixxx) It is submitted that the argument of the private parties which was based on section 44
(2) of the PMLA, that the twin conditions in section 45 are applicable only to the Special Court
and not to the High Court, is totally erroneous. Clarification under section 44 was required, as
similar provision in special enactments have been interpreted to oust the maintainability of bail
application directly to the High Court*. Thus, section 44 mainly deals with the issue of
jurisdiction. Further, it is submitted that if the twin conditions for bail are held to be applicable
only when the application of bail is filed in the Special Court and not when the application for
bail is filed before the High Court, then such interpretation would completely render the
provision arbitrary.
17. At the outset, it is submitted by Mr. S. V. Raju, Additional Solicitor General of India that for
attracting article 20(3) of the Constitution, three things should be established. Firstly, the person
should be accused of an offence ; secondly, such a person should be compelled to make the
statement ; and thirdly, such compulsion should be for the purpose of being a witness against
himself. Unless all these three ingredients exist, the protection of article 20(3) cannot be
attracted :
(i) With regard to the requirement of "person accused of an offence", it is submitted that
there has to be a formal accusation against such person, which should either be in the form of
FIR or a complaint filed before the court. It is urged that for article 20(3) of the Constitution to
apply, the concerned person should be an accused at the time when the statement was made by
him and not because the person concerned is accused of offence at the time of trial. Therefore,
the thrust of the plea is that a statement recorded under section 50(2) of the PMLA would not
violate article 20(3) of the Constitution, if the person making the statement is not an accused of
or named in money-laundering offence at the time when the statement under section 50(2) was
made. Reliance has been placed on M. P. Sharma V. Satish Chandra, District Magistrate**
to
state that "formal accusation" relating to the commission of the offence is a pre-requisite
condition for the applicability of article 20(3). Reliance has also been placed on Mohammed
Dastagir V. State of Madras***, wherein a Constitution Bench of this
[1954] SCR 1077.
AIR 1960 SC 756.
court observed that article 20(3) would be available only to those persons against whom FIR
has been registered. Therefore, it is contended that necessity of a formal accusation can only be
met by the registration of an FIR or submission of a complaint against the concerned person, in
order to make him an accused for the purpose of article 20(3) of the Constitution. Further
reliance has been made on Kathi Kalu Oghad (supra), wherein an eleven-Judge Bench of this
court held that the person who made the statement must stand in the character of accused at
the time when the statement was made in order to attract article 20(3). The decision of five-
Judge Bench of this court in Raja Narayan Bansilal V. Maneck Phiroz Mistry* has also been relied
upon. It is urged that the examination of a person cannot be regarded as proceeding started
against him, as it is only after gathering information against a person through examination, it
may be concluded that there is a commission of an offence or not. Accusation of an offence is,
therefore, a condition precedent for the application of article 20(3) of the Constitution**.
Reliance has also been placed on Ramesh Chandra Mehta (supra) to state that lodging of an FIR
or a complaint is the essential requirement of formal accusation, as a person stands in the
character of an accused only when a FIR is lodged against him in respect of an offence or when a
complaint is made against him relating to the commission of an offence. It is stated that the
court in Ramesh Chandra Mehta (supra) has further approved the view of the Madras High Court
in Collector of Customs, Madras V. Kotumal Bhirumal Pihlajani***, wherein the court held that
when the statements are recorded by Customs Officers under section 108 of the 1962 Act, the
maker of the statement do not stand in the position of an accused. Similar view of the Bombay
High Court in the case of Laxman Padma Bhagat V. State# was also approved and the contrary
view of the Calcutta High Court in Calcutta Motor Cycle Co. V. Collector of Customs## was held
to be incorrect.
(ii) Reliance has been placed on Harbansingh Sardar Lenasingh V. State of Maharashtra##:
to state that a statement recorded by a Customs Officer under section 108 of the 1962 Act is
admissible evidence and is not hit by section 25 of the 1872 Act or article 20(3) of the
Constitution, as the same has been concluded by the decision of this court in Ramesh Chandra
Mehta (supra). It is further submitted that the court in Nandini Satpathy was not concerned with
article 20(3) of the Constitution and accepted the
* (1960) 30 Comp Cas 644 (SC) ; AIR 1961 SC 29.
K. Joseph Augusthi V. M. A. Narayanan (1964) 34 Comp Cas 546 (SC) ; AIR 1964 SC 1552.
view of this court in Ramesh Chandra Mehta (supra) as correct. Therefore, it is submitted that
at the stage of recording of statements under section 50(2) of the PMLA, only information is
being collected for deciding as to whether the attachment of the property has to take place and
at that stage there is no accusation against any person. Reliance has also been placed on
Balkishan A. Devidayal (supra) and Poolpandi (supra) to state that only a person against whom
any formal accusation of the commission of an offence has been made, can be a person accused
of an offence within the meaning of article 20(3)* of the Constitution, which may be specifically
made against him in an FIR or a formal document resulting in the prosecution in court. Further,
reliance has been made on Poolpandi (supra) to state that the ratio of Ramesh Chandra Mehta
(supra) cannot be ignored because of observations made in Nandini Satpathy. Therefore, it is
submitted that when statements under section 50(2) of the PMLA are made by a person, then at
that stage such person does not stand in the character of an accused, as there is no formal
accusation against him by way of a complaint or an FIR and thus, there is no violation of article
20(3) of the Constitution.
(iii) With regard to the issue of "compulsion", it is submitted that this issue will arise only
when the person concerned is held to be "accused" of an offence. Reliance has been further
placed on M. P. Sharma (supra) and Nandini Satpathy (supra) to state that compelled testimony
can be "procured not merely by physical threats or violence but by psychic torture, atmospheric
pressure, environmental coercion, tiring interrogative prolixity, overbearing and intimidatory
methods and the like, not legal penalty". Therefore, it is submitted that "compulsion" is a
question of fact, to be decided at the stage of trial and cannot be generalized and decided in the
present case.
(iv) Relying on the case of Nandini Satpathy (supra) and C. Sampath Kumar V. Enforcement
Officer, Enforcement Directorate**, it is submitted that the legal penalties imposed on a person
on his refusal to answer truthfully, cannot be regarded as a compulsion within the meaning of
article 20(3) of the Constitution. Therefore, it is submitted that the contentions of the private
parties that provisions contained in sections 50(3), (4) and 63(2) amount to legal compulsion
violating the fundamental right under article 20(3) of the Constitution, is devoid of any merit.
(v) With regard to the issue of "being a witness against oneself", it is submitted that the
witness can be classified into four types-(i) relevant yet innocent ; (ii) relevant and may have
no incriminatory force ; (iii) incriminatory without being confessional ; and (iv) confessional.
Relying on the
case of Nandini Satpathy (supra), it is submitted that article 20(3) applies to confessions and
self-incriminations, but leaves untouched other relevant facts. Therefore, unless there is an
admission of an offence in clear terms, the statement even if it is gravely incriminatory in
nature, will not amount to a confession*. It is further submitted that apart from above four
categories of witnesses, there can be two other categories, namely, a witness who makes an
admission not amounting to confession and a witness whose statement comprises both
exculpatory and inculpatory statements. Reliance has been placed on the case of Central Bureau
of Investigation V. V. C. Shukla** to state that a statement made by an accused is admissible
in evidence under section 21 of the 1872 Act, if it falls short of a confession. It is, therefore,
submitted that the question whether a statement is a confession or not, is essentially a question
of fact, which cannot be decided in the present case.
(vi) The respondent has further relied on the judgment of the Andhra Pradesh High Court in
Dalmia Cement (Bharat) Limited (supra), wherein it was held that an ECIR cannot be equated
with an FIR. Therefore, the person against whom the summons has been issued under section
50(2) read with section 50(3), is not a person accused of an offence. Hence, section 50 does not
violate article 20(3) of the Constitution. Reliance has been placed on the decision of the Delhi
High Court in Virbhadra Singh (supra) to state that mere registration of an ECIR would not
render any person an accused of the offence of money-laundering. Reliance has also been placed
on Vakamulla Chandrashekhar, wherein it is stated that a Division Bench of the Delhi High Court
held that the person against whom summons has been issued under section 50 of the PMLA
cannot be construed as person accused of an offence, unless a complaint is filed before the
Special Court.
(vii) Replying to the submissions of Mr. Aabad Ponda, learned senior counsel, it is submitted
by the learned Additional Solicitor General that in Ramanlal Bhogilal Shah (supra), there was
already an FIR registered against the accused under the FERA Act, therefore, he stood in the
character of accused person. Whereas, in the case of PMLA, the FIR is registered for the
predicate offence and not for the offence of money-laundering. Therefore, the ratio of Ramanlal
Bhogilal Shah (supra) cannot be applied in the present case as the two offences-predicate
offence and the offence of money-laundering are different.
(viii) With regard to section 25 of the 1872 Act, it is submitted that for the bar contained
under section 25 of the 1872 Act to apply, three things need to be established-(i) confession
(ii) such concession is made to a
* Aghnoo Nagesia V. State of Bihar, AIR 1966 SC 119.
police officer and (iii) the person should be an accused. It is submitted that the officers who
record statements under section 50 of the PMLA are not police officers ; therefore, section 25 of
the 1872 Act will not apply in case the statement is made to ED officers. It is stated that the
statements recorded by police under section 161 of the Cr. P. C. are different than the statement
recorded by the ED officer under section 50(2) of the PMLA. As such, statements are treated as
"evidence" in the proceedings under the Act. It is further stated that section 108 of the 1962 Act
is pari materia to section 50 of the PMLA and the statements recorded therein are considered as
evidence. Reliance has been placed on Tofan Singh (supra), wherein it was held that section 67
of the NDPS Act is different from section 108 of the 1962 Act, in so far as the statements made
therein are evidence as opposed to section 67 of the NDPS Act. Therefore, it is stated that the
same reasoning will apply in this case and as the statements recorded under section 50(2) are
considered as evidence, the ED officer cannot be termed as "police officer".
(ix) Further, reliance has been placed on section 45(1A) of the PMLA to submit that the
section bars investigation of an offence by police officers into the offence of money-laundering
and if the ED officers are held to be police officers, then they would become incompetent to
investigate the offence of money-laundering under the PMLA. It is submitted that in various
decisions of this court, it has been held that the officers who are not empowered to file a
chargesheet are not police officers. To buttress this submission, the reliance has been placed on
Badaku Joti Savant V. State of Mysore*, Ramesh Chandra Mehta (supra), Illias V. Collector of
Customs** State of U. P. V. Durga Prasad and Balkishan A. Devidayal (supra).
(x) It is urged that as the officers of the ED are not empowered to file a chargesheet and
consequently, they cannot be regarded as police officer. After investigation, the ED officers can
only file a complaint before the Special Court under section 44(1)(b) of the PMLA. Further, it is
stated that as per the definition of "complaint" under section 2(d) of the Cr. P. C., a "police
report" cannot be regarded as a "complaint", as they are both mutually exclusive terms. It is
further submitted that a police officer cannot submit a complaint and an ED officer cannot file a
chargesheet. Otherwise, section 155(4) and section 155(2) would be rendered otiose, as in a
case falling under section 155(4) of the Cr. P. C., if the police officer after investigation forms an
opinion that only non-cognisable case is made out, then
* AIR 1966 SC 1746.
AIR 1970 SC 1065.
in such a situation he is required to file a police report in view of provision of section 155(4),
but due to the operation of section 2(d), the same will be treated as a complaint and the police
officer would be treated as a complainant. Also, in a case where magistrate orders the police
officer to investigate a non-cognisable offence under section 155(2) of the Cr. P. C., then in view
of operation of section 155(3) of the Cr. P. C., the police officer would necessarily file
a
chargesheet. However, due to the operation of section 2(d), the chargesheet will be treated as a
complaint and he will be treated as a complainant. It is submitted that in case where a police
officer investigates a non-cognisable offence, the Legislature has, by way of a deeming fiction,
treated the chargesheet as a "complaint", whereas no such fiction applies in the case of officer
investigating a PMLA offence, as he can only file a complaint which does not require any fiction
or deeming provision. Therefore, even in case of non-cognisable offence, the police officer is only
empowered to file a police report, whereas in case of the PMLA offence, the ED officers are only
required to file a complaint which is not to be treated as a chargesheet, otherwise the Legislature
would have provided for a reverse deeming fiction of treating the complaint as a chargesheet.
(xi) Reliance has been placed on CIT V. Calcutta Stock Exchange Association Ltd.* to state
that the word "deemed" shows that the Legislature was deliberately using the fiction of treating
something as something else. Reliance has been placed on the decision of the Delhi High Court
in Lajpat Rai Sehgal V. State**, to state that after investigation of non-cognisable offence the
police officer has to submit a report which is deemed to be a complaint. Reliance has also been
placed on the decision of the Delhi High Court in Narain Singh V. State*** wherein a similar
view has been taken. It is submitted that this court in several cases, has held that the function
of police officers are prevention and detection of a crime. Reliance has been placed on the
decision in Barkat Ram (supra) to urge that the primary function of police officers is to maintain
law and order. The authority empowered to investigate the offence in above mentioned case was
not concerned with the maintenance of law and order and detection and prevention of crime, but
with some other function such as collection and levy of duty on goods or detection and
prevention of smuggling of goods. Notwithstanding the fact that some incidental powers of
search, seizure, arrest and investigation of an offence are also conferred on such officer, he
* (1959) 36 ITR 222 (SC) ; AIR 1959 SC 7
(1983) 5 DRJ 1 ; (1983) 23 DLT 314.
(1986) 10 DRJ 109 ; (1986) 30 DLT 118.
cannot be termed as a police officer as his primary function is to detect and prevent
smuggling of goods so as to protect the State exchequer. Therefore, it is submitted that the
dominant purpose is to be seen. In case of the PMLA, the dominant purpose is prevention of
money-laundering, attachment and confiscation of property involved in money-laundering,
whereas all other matters with which the ED officers are involved, are only incidental matters.
Therefore, as submitted, the ED officers cannot be termed as police officers. The preamble of the
Act and Statement of Objects and Reasons of the Act have been relied upon to state that the
officers of the ED are primarily concerned with the prevention of money-laundering and for
confiscation of property derived from or involved in money-laundering.
(xii) Reliance has been placed on Pareena Swarup V. Union of India* to state that the object
of the PMLA is to bring the proceeds of crime back into the economy. Reliance has also been
placed on the decision of the Delhi High Court in Vakamulla Chandrashekhar (supra) to state
that the offence of money-laundering has both, civil and criminal consequences and the Act
empowers the Adjudicating Authority with the powers of civil court, so as to adjudicate on the
issue of whether any property is involved in money-laundering and to attach and ultimately
confiscate such property.
(xiii) Relying on section 50(4), it is stated that ED officers act judicially under section 50(2),
whereas a police officer recording a statement under section 161 of the Cr. P. C. does not act
judicially. To substantiate the argument, reliance has been placed on Balkishan A. Devidayal
(supra).
(xiv) It is further stated that the proceedings under the PMLA are judicial proceedings, similar
to the proceedings under the 1962 Act under section 108. Therefore, on a parity of reasoning,
the ED officials are not police officers, as held in Balkishan A. Devidayal. It is further submitted
that under section 63(2) of the PMLA, the ED officials are empowered to impose penalty which is
a judicial function, whereas the police officials have no such power. It is also submitted that the
contentions of the private parties that the statement recorded under section 50(2) will have to
comply with the requirements of section 162 of the Cr. P. C., is devoid of any substance, as the
statements recorded under section 50(2) of the PMLA are not statements recorded under section
161 of the Cr. P. C. Under section 50(2) of the PMLA, the ED officer is not a police officer as he is
acting judicially under the provision. The statement recorded under section 50(2) is treated as
evidence, whereas such is not the case with the statement recorded under section 161 of the Cr.
P. C. Statements under section 50(2) are
required to be signed, whereas such is not the case with statements recorded under section
161 of the Cr. P. C. Further, the investigation under the PMLA is different from the investigation
under the Cr. P. C. It is then submitted that as the statements given under section 50 of the
PMLA are required to be signed and are given in the judicial proceeding within the meaning of
sections 193 and 228 of the IPC, therefore, the presumption under section 80 of the 1872 Act
will apply and it shall be presumed that the document is genuine and the circumstances under
which it was taken are true and such evidence, statement or confession was duly taken.
Whereas, section 80 of the 1872 Act cannot have any application under the statements made
under section 161 of the Cr. P. C. To buttress the submission, reliance was placed on the
decisions of this court in Baleshwar Rai V. State of Bihar* and Dipakbhai Jagdishchandra Patel V.
State of Gujarat** Even by applying section 65 of the PMLA, it is stated that the bar of section
162 of the Cr. P. C., cannot be applied to statements made under section 50(2) of the PMLA
because of the inconsistencies shown above. Further, if the Legislature had intended to apply
section 162 of the Cr. P. C., then it would have done so in the Act itself, as it has been done
under the Bihar and Orissa Excise Act, 1915
(xv) It is submitted that the ratio of Tofan Singh (supra), where it was held that the
statement recorded under section 67 of the NDPS Act cannot be used as a confessional
statement for the trial of an offence under the NDPS Act, will not apply to section 50(2) of the
PMLA. It is also submitted that the provisions of the PMLA are materially different from that of
the NDPS Act. In the case of NDPS Act, a regular police officer, as well as, a designated officer,
both are permitted to investigate the offence under the NDPS Act. Whereas, in the case of the
PMLA, there is a bar contained in section 45(1A) of the PMLA which prohibits a police officer from
investigating the offence under the PMLA. In the NDPS Act, because of such provision, sections
161 to 164 of the Cr. P. C., as also section 25 of the 1872 Act, would be applicable making the
recorded statement inadmissible, in case the statements are recorded by a police officer.
However, if the same investigation is conducted by a designated officer other than the police
officer, then such provisions will not apply, making the procedure discriminatory and in violation
of article 14 of the Constitution, which is not the case under the PMLA.
* (1963) 2 SCR 433.
For short, "1915 Act".
(xvi) It is submitted that in case of the NDPS Act, there is no provision of further investigation
by the designated officer. However, if the investigation is made by a police officer, then in that
case he has the power to further investigate under section 173(8) of the Cr. P. C. Such
inconsistency does not occur in the case of the PMLA, as in this case, because of the bar
contained in section 45(1A), the police officers are not entitled to investigate the offence of
money-laundering. And further, the Explanation (ii) to section 44 of the PMLA contemplates
filing of subsequent complaint in case any further investigation is conducted.
(xvii) Another anomaly noted by this court in Tofan Singh (supra) is that when such
designated officer is investigating the offence under the NDPS Act, then he has no power to file
closure report. However, there is no such anomaly present in the PMLA Act because the
investigating authority can file a closure report under the proviso to section 44(1)(b) of the
PMLA.
(xviii) It is further submitted that in Tofan Singh (supra), it was held that if the statement
recorded under section 67 of the NDPS Act is held to be admissible in all situations, then it will
render section 53A of the NDPS Act otiose, whereas the PMLA does not contain any provision
similar to section 53A of the NDPS Act.
(xix) Further, in the case of the NDPS Act, prevention, detection and punishment of crime was
not held to be ancillary function of the Act. However, in the case of the PMLA, the main purpose
is prevention of money- laundering and confiscation of property derived from or involved in
money-laundering.
(xx) Further, the PMLA does not contain any provision which invest the power of an officer in
charge of a police station, including the power to file a chargesheet, in the investigating officer
as contained in the NDPS Act. Moreover, in case of the NDPS Act, the investigating authority is
required to file a chargesheet. However, in case of the PMLA, cognisance is taken on a complaint.
(xxi) Lastly, it is contended that section 50 of the PMLA is almost identical to section 108 of
the 1962 Act. Therefore, the statements made under section 50 are evidence as opposed to
section 67 of the NDPS Act. Hence, section 50(2) of the PMLA cannot be read down as done in
Tofan Singh (supra), in case of section 67 of the NDPS Act.
(xxii) The respondent has demonstrated the legislative history of section 24 of the PMLA and
cited recommendation 3 of the FATF (2003)/ recommendation 4 of FATF (2012) to state that the
FATF had stipulated that the burden of proving the lawful origin of the property shall be on the
accused. In view of the FATF recommendations and the recommendations of the Standing
Committee of Finance (2011-12), comprehensive amendments were made to the provisions of
the PMLA. It is submitted that the Standing Committee of Finance recommended that there
should be adequate safeguards for persons not charged with the offence of money-laundering
therefore section 24 was amended in its present form. It is submitted that the concerns of the
Standing Committee have been incorporated under the provision by using the word "may" in
case of any other person and the word "shall" in case of a person charged with the offence of
money-laundering under section 24 of the PMLA. Therefore, it would be wrong to say that the
provision is not constitutionally valid, as the provision itself contains safeguard for the person
not charged with the offence of money-laundering.
(xxiii) It is submitted that in criminal trials the standard of proof is beyond reasonable doubt.
However, such rule of evidence is neither found in section 101 nor in section 3 of the 1872 Act,
which defines the word "proved". Therefore, it cannot be said that this principle is a principle of
universal application and, therefore, Legislature in appropriate classes of legislations would be
competent to take departure from this principle. It is submitted that when the Legislature enacts
a provision which states that the burden of proof is shifted to the accused then what is actually
done is that standard of proof beyond reasonable doubt is lowered. It is submitted that Professor
Glanville Williams in his book-The Proof of Guilt has also criticized the doctrine of proving the
guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt. It is stated that this principle generally entails the
acquittal of the guilty person which frustrate the investigation of the police, as a result of which
they may resort to improper methods of obtaining convictions, also the law and order gets into
the turmoil.
(xxiv) The respondent admits that the principle of innocence is a human right and forms the
basis of criminal jurisprudence*. Reliance has been placed on Hiten P. Dalal V. Bratindranath
Banerjee**, which dealt with an offence under section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act,
1881** and considered the effect of presumption raised under section 139 thereof, to urge that
the presumptions are rule of evidence and do not conflict with the presumption of innocence.
The prosecution is obliged to prove the case against the accused beyond reasonable doubt.
However, such obligation may be discharged with the help of presumptions of law or fact unless
the
For short, "1881 Act".
accused rebut the presumption by showing the reasonable possibility of non-existence of the
presumed fact. It is stated that there is a need to balance the rights of the accused with the
interest of the society. Reliance is placed on Krishna Janardhan Bhat V. Dattatraya G. Hegde* to
urge that the nature of offence, seriousness and gravity thereof may be taken into consideration
in interdicting the presumption of innocence. Reliance has also been placed on Sucha Singh V.
State of Punjab** to state that departure from traditional rule relating to the burden of proof is
imperative ; otherwise, the offenders in serious offences would be the major beneficiaries and
the society would be the casualty. It is submitted that the PMLA is an Act which tackles a social
evil and does require departure from normal criminal jurisprudence. Reliance has been placed on
P. N. Krishna Lal V. Government of Kerala* to state that the purpose of law should be taken
into consideration while interpreting the law. It is submitted that sometimes harsh remedies are
required, which takes a departure from normal criminal jurisprudence to tackle new and
emerging situations. Further reliance has been placed on the 47th Report of the Law
Commission, 1972, which observed that special efforts are necessary to eliminate the effect of
socio- economic offences and stringent provisions are essential to safeguard the national wealth
and welfare. It is submitted that the PMLA seeks to achieve the goal of deterrence and also
confiscation of proceeds of crime and, therefore, the provision is in line with the 47th Law
Commission Report. It is pointed out that even the general statutes such as the IPC and the
1872 Act also provide for the reverse burden of proof#. It is, therefore, submitted that the
shifting of burden of proof which is nothing but a departure from ordinary criminal jurisprudence
of proving the case beyond reasonable doubt, is not only contained in the special statutes, which
tends to prevent serious crime against the society at large, but is also contained in the
provisions of the IPC and the 1872 Act. Thus, it cannot be said that presumption of innocence is
a constitutional guarantee.
(xxv) It is submitted that to give effect to the object of the NDPS Act, the court in Noor Aga
V. State of Punjab##, upheld the constitutional validity of sections 35 and 54 of the NDPS Act,
which provides presumption against the accused and reverse burden of proof. Reliance has also
been placed on Seema Silk and Sarees V. Directorate of Enforcement# # wherein
the court upheld the challenge to the constitutional validity of section 18 of the FERA, which
provides for reverse burden of proof, to state that a legal provision does not become
unconstitutional merely because it provides for reverse burden of proof. Further Reliance is
placed on Sodhi Transport Co. V. State of U. P.* to state that a rebuttable presumption, which is
a rule of evidence, cannot be said to be unconstitutional because the person concerned has the
opportunity to displace the presumption by leading evidence. It is submitted that section 24 of
the PMLA also provides for rebuttable presumption and, therefore, the accused has the
opportunity to lead evidence so as to displace the presumption against him. Thus, it cannot be
said that section 24 is unreasonable, arbitrary or unconstitutional.
(xxvi) With regard to section 24(a) of the PMLA, it is submitted that two conditions are
required to be satisfied for the presumption under section 24(a) to apply. Firstly, person should
be "charged" with the offence of money-laundering and secondly, there should be "proceeds of
crime". It is only when both the conditions are satisfied, it can be said that the presumption will
operate against the accused.
(xxvii) Reliance has been placed on Union of India V. Prafulla Kumar Samal** to state that for
framing of charges, a prima facie case against the accused has to be made out by the
prosecution*** which means that a grave suspicion should be there against the accused.
Therefore, the requirement of framing of charges against the accused under section 3 of the
PMLA itself acts as a safeguard against the arbitrary exercise of the provision. Secondly, it is
stated that the existence of proceeds of crime will be the foundational fact under section 24(a) of
the Act. It is further submitted by the learned Additional Solicitor General that even when the
presumption against the accused is applied then also the accused will have the opportunity to
rebut the same by leading evidence or by replying adequately under section 313 of the Cr. P. C.
or by cross examining the prosecution witness.
(xxviii) A comparison is drawn between section 24 of the PMLA and section 106 of the 1872
Act to submit that similar results would appear even if the provision like section 24(a) of the
PMLA was not there because of section 106 of the 1872 Act. By way of an illustration, it has been
explained that the results of section 106 and section 24(a) would be the same in a case where
money is lying in a house where incidentally a person is found, then the burden of proving that
the person has nothing to do with the proceeds of crime is on that person itself because of
section 106 of the 1872 Act, which states that when any fact is especially within the knowledge
of any person, the burden of proving that fact is upon him. Reliance has been placed on
Sarbananda Sonowal V. Union of India*, wherein it was held that the facts regarding date of
birth, place of birth, name of parents, place of citizenship and birth, are all facts within the
special personal knowledge of the concerned person and it will be impossible for the State to
lead evidence on aforesaid points. Therefore, any fact which would be impossible for the
prosecution to establish, as is specially and exceptionally within the exclusive knowledge of the
accused, would have to be proved by the accused himself. Therefore, it is submitted that the
shifting of burden of proof under section 24(a) of the PMLA is not violative of article 14 or 21 of
the Constitution of India.
(xxix) It is further pointed out that the contentions of the private parties that the court in
Noor Aga (supra) and Tofan Singh (supra) has read into section 54 of the NDPS Act the
requirement of proving foundational fact of possession, is wholly incorrect and misplaced, as it
would be clear from the bare language of section 54 itself that the possession is the foundational
fact which has to be established and only then the presumption under section 54 of the NDPS
Act will apply.
(xxx) With regard to section 24(b) of the PMLA, it is submitted that it applies to a person who
is not charged with the offence of money-laundering and uses the word "may" instead of "shall".
It is submitted that presumptions falling under the category of "may presume" does not make it
obligatory on the court to regard such fact as proved and it is the discretion of the court to either
regard such fact as proved or may call proof of it. Whereas, presumptions falling under the
category of "shall presume" are mandatory in nature, also known as legal presumptions, and the
court has to regard such fact as proved unless and until it is disproved** It is, therefore,
submitted that presumption contained under section 24(b) is discretionary in nature. It is
submitted that the presumption under section 24(b) can be raised at the stage of bail and other
proceedings, prior to the stage of framing of charges. As before granting bail under the PMLA,
the court
State of Madras V. A. Vaidyanatha Iyer, AIR 1958 SC 61 and M. Narsinga Rao V. State of A. P.
has to be satisfied that the accused is not guilty of the offence ; therefore, the court may
resort to section 24(b) in exercise of its discretion.
(xxxi) Further, it is submitted that the word "authority" under the PMLA refers to the
Adjudicating Authority and not authority under section 48 of the PMLA. It is further submitted
that the arguments of the private parties that section 24(b) of the PMLA is draconian in nature,
is wholly incorrect, as the presumption is discretionary in nature. Foundational fact of proceeds
of crime is condition precedent to the application of the provision and the presumptions can only
be raised before the court or Adjudicating Authority.
(xxxii) Further, while relying on the decision in Pareena Swarup (supra) and Madras Bar
Association V. Union of India* and section 6 of the PMLA, it is stated that Adjudicating Authority
is an independent authority, without prejudice to the fact that the functions of authority is civil
in nature and standard of proof would be preponderance of probabilities and not proof beyond
reasonable doubt in a proceeding before it.
(xxxiii) Repelling the challenge under article 20(1) of the Constitution with regard to the
retrospective applicability of the Act, it is submitted that the Act does not punish or seek to
punish a person for any act committed prior to the PMLA or prior to the addition of the concerned
offence in the Schedule to the PMLA coming into force. It is submitted that article 20(1) of the
Constitution prohibits the making of an ex post facto criminal law, i. e., making an act a crime
for the first time and making that law retrospective. It also prohibits infliction of a penalty
greater than that which might have been inflicted under the law in force when the act was
committed. Reference has been made to Rao Shiv Bahadur Singh V. State of Vindhya Pradesh**
to urge that what is prohibited under article 20(1) is only the conviction or sentence and not trial
thereof. It has been further emphasised that the expression "law in force" used in article 20(1),
refers to the law in fact in existence and in operation at the time of the commission of the
offence, as distinct from the law "deemed" to have become operative by virtue of the power of
Legislature to pass retrospective law.
(xxxiv) In light of the said principles, it is submitted that an offence might be either a "single
act", i. e., an offence which is terminated by a single act, or a "continuing offence", i. e., an act
which does not terminate by a single act, but rather continues to subsist over a period of time. It
is submitted that the offence of money-laundering, as described under section 3 of the PMLA, in
a given case would be a continuing offence, and, thus,
cannot be labelled as having retrospective operation. It is submitted that the objective of the
PMLA is not to punish the accused for the scheduled offence, but rather for the independent
offence of money-laundering committed under section 3 of the Act. The argument proceeds that
an Act cannot be said to be retrospective just because a part of the requisites for its action is
drawn from a time antecedent to its passing*.
(xxxv) The respondent has placed reliance on Mohan Lal V. State of Rajasthan**. In this case,
theft of 10 kgs of opium had taken place prior to the coming into force of the NDPS Act, but
opium was subsequently recovered after the commencement of the NDPS Act. Inter alia, the
conviction under the NDPS Act was challenged on the ground that there can be ex post facto
application of the NDPS Act. This court, while upholding the conviction and rejecting the plea of
article 20(1), observed that what is punishable is the possession of the prohibited article on or
after a particular date when the statute was enacted, making the offence punishable or
enhancing the punishment. It is, thus, submitted that in the case of an offence under the PMLA,
the date of coming into force of the PMLA, i. e., July 1, 2005 or the date when the predicate
offence was committed, is irrelevant if the PMLA offence is committed on a date subsequent to
both the above date. Similarly, reliance is also placed on the decisions of the Supreme Court of
the United States in Samuels V. McCurdy, Sheriff** and Chicago and Alton
Railroad
Company
V.
Henry A. Tranbarger# to restate the aforementioned principles of law. Additionally, our attention
was drawn to the provisions governing period of limitation, namely sections 469# # and 472*#
of the Cr. P. C. It is submitted that as per section 469, in case

# # 469. Commencement of the period of limitation.-(1) The period of limitation, in relation toan
offender, shall commence,-(a) on the date of the offence ; or(b) where the commission of the
offence was not known to the person aggrieved by theoffence or to any police officer, the first day
on which such offence comes to the knowledgeof such person or to any police officer, whichever is
earlier ; or(c) where it is not known by whom the offence was committed, the first day on whichthe
identity of the offender is known to the person aggrieved by the offence or to thepolice officer
making investigation into the offence, whichever is earlier. (2) In computing the said period, the
day from which such period is to be computedshall be excluded.
472. Continuing offence.-In the case of a continuing offence, a fresh period of limitationshall
begin to run at every moment of the time during which the offence continues.
of a single act, the date of commencement of the limitation period is the date on which the
offence was committed. However, the position is different for a continuing offence, inasmuch as,
the date of commencement of the limitation period in such a case would be the date on which
the continuing offence ended*. Reliance has been placed on Gokak Patel Volkart Ltd. V.
Dundayya Gurushiddaiah Hiremath** wherein this court while dealing with section 630 of the
Companies Act, held that the offence of wrongful possession is recurring and continues until the
wrongful possession is put to an end. This court further held that such an offence is committed
over a span of time and the last act of the offence will control or amount to the commencement
of the period of limitation. Thus, the offences involving possession are continuing in nature, and
the period of limitation for such offences would start from the date of cessation of the
possession.
(xxxvi) It is then submitted that the concept of possession is central to the offence of money-
laundering. Inasmuch as, all the six activities recognized under section 3 of the Act involve an
element of possession of proceeds of crime. He further goes on to state that such possession
need not necessarily be actual physical possession, but also may be legal or constructive
possession. To this effect, reliance is placed on Gunwantlal V. State of Madhya Pradesh***,
wherein the concept of constructive possession was recognised by this court. Strong emphasis
has been laid on section 2(1)(fa) # of the Act, which defines the term "beneficial owner", to urge
that the concept of constructive possession is recognised under the Act as well. It is submitted
that possession of proceeds of crime being key to the offence of money, all activities having an
element of possession after July 1, 2005 shall fall within the ambit of the Act irrespective of the
date on which the scheduled offence was committed. For, the offence of money-laundering is a
continuing offence, the cause of action for which renews with every day of possession. Thus, it is
submitted that the argument of the private parties claiming protection of article 20(1) is devoid
of merit.
(xxxvii) At the outset, it is submitted that an ECIR under the PMLA is not required be
registered like an FIR under section 154 of the Cr. P. C. It is further submitted that as per the
scheme of the Cr. P. C., a police officer is mandatorily required to register an FIR under section
154 upon receipt of
* Section 472 of the Cr. P. C.
# 2. Definitions.-(1) In this Act, unless the context otherwise requires,

means an individual who ultimately owns or controls a client of areporting entity or the person on
whose behalf a transaction is being conducted andincludes a person who exercises ultimate
effective control over a juridical person.
information regarding commission of a cognisable offence. However, the PMLA contains no
such provision regarding receipt of information or registration*. To lend support to his
arguments, the learned Additional Solicitor General points out certain differences between
investigation under the Cr. P. C. and the PMLA. Firstly, the nature of "investigation", as
envisaged under section 2(h)* of the Cr. P. C. is different from that under the PMLA, as defined
under section 2(1)(na)** of the PMLA, in so far as the investigation under the Cr. P. C. is
a
proceeding for collection of evidence. Therefore, any proceeding that does not amount to
collection of evidence, cannot amount to investigation, and only upon the registration of the FIR,
can the police officer start investigation. Secondly, it is submitted that an investigation under
the Cr. P. C. is ordinarily required to be conducted by a police officer, or any person so
authorised by a Magistrate. In contrast, section 45(1A)# of the PMLA explicitly bars investigation
by a police officer, save for cases when the officer is specifically authorized by the Central
Government. Thirdly, investigation under the Cr. P. C. necessarily needs to be for purpose of
collecting evidence in relation to cognizable offences for which an FIR under section 154 has
been registered# On the contrary, investigation, i. e., collection of evidence under the PMLA
need not necessarily be in relation to the cognizable offence of money-laundering, but it can also
be for the purposes of attachment, confiscation, formulation of reasons to conduct search or
seizure under section 17, or personal search under section 18, etc. This further implies that
unlike the procedure under the Cr. P. C., where the registration of an FIR is a condition
precedent to initiation of investigation # #, in such cases, the investigation can commence

even prior to the receipt of information pertaining to commission of money-laundering. In this
regard, the learned Additional Solicitor General draws our attention to section 17(1)(iv) and
section 5(1) of the PMLA which empower the Director to collect evidence by way of search and
seizure, and attachment of property respectively. It is submitted that this power to investigate,
conferred upon the Director by these provisions, is based on a "reason to believe" that a person
may be in possession of property related to crime* or proceeds of crime** and can be exercised
at a stage preceding the receipt of information regarding commission of a cognizable offence.
(xxxviii) It is then submitted that the provisions of the Cr. P. C. have limited applicability to
the proceedings under the PMLA. According to section 65 of the PMLA, the provisions of the Cr. P.
C. shall apply to arrest, search and seizure, attachment, confiscation, investigation, prosecution
and all other proceedings under the Act, so long as the same are not inconsistent with the
provisions of the Act. It is the case of the respondents that registration of an FIR does not
amount to collection of evidence, and, thus, is outside the purview of "investigation", as defined
under section 2(1)(na) of the PMLA. Consequently, it is submitted that since the registration of
an FIR does not fall into any of seven categories contemplated under section 65, section 154 of
the Cr. P. C. will not apply to proceedings under the PMLA.
(xxxix) As regards the provision of a copy of the ECIR to the accused, it is submitted that
unlike an FIR which is a statutory mandate, an ECIR is an internal document and, thus, need not
be supplied to the accused. In response to the argument of the private parties that the failure to
supply a copy of the ECIR prejudices the rights of an accused, it is stated that revealing a copy
of the ECIR would defeat the purpose of the Act and would frustrate recovery provisions like
attachment of property. The learned Additional Solicitor General also refutes the submission of
the private parties that a copy of the ECIR would be useful for grant of anticipatory bail. It is
submitted that in cases of offences under the IPC, anticipatory bail can be applied for even prior
to the registration of an FIR***. Moreover, it is often the case that the FIR is registered against
unknown persons, and the FIR, therefore, cannot be said to be an encyclopaedia of all the
facts#.
* Section 17(1)(iv) of the PMLA.
Section 5(1)(a) of the PMLA.
(xl) Next, the learned Additional Solicitor General made submissions on the challenge to
constitutionality of sections 17 and 18 of the PMLA (i. e., the provisions relating to the power of
search and seizure). According to him, section 17 in itself contains sufficient safeguards.
Reference is made to section 17(1), to highlight that only the Director or any other officer not
below the rank of Deputy Director, who are high ranking officials, can authorise a search and that
too only on the basis of a reason to believe of the existence of conditions laid down therein. It is
submitted that the vesting of the power to authorise a search and seizure under section 17 with
the highest responsible authority prevents misuse of the provision. Reliance is placed on Pooran
Mal V. Director of Inspection (Investigation)*, to that effect. This is yet bolstered by the
mandate of having to record the reasons to believe in writing. It is further pointed out that in
terms of section 17(2), the officer conducting the search shall forward a copy of the reasons
recorded and material in his possession to the Adjudicating Authority in a sealed envelope
immediately after the search and seizure. It is submitted that this safeguard ensures that the
reasons so recorded upon a search and seizure and the material in the possession of the
concerned officer is not tampered with. It is also submitted that in terms of section 17(4), the
Authority seizing the records or property shall, within a period of thirty days from the date of
such seizure, file an application with the Adjudicating Authority for the retention of the said
records. Pursuant to such application, the Adjudicating Authority, in terms of section 8, then
issues a show- cause notice to the concerned person whose records or property are seized. Thus,
the concerned person is given ample opportunity to be heard and show cause as to why such
records or property should not be retained.
(xli) Emphasis is laid on section 62 of the PMLA, which provides for a punishment of
imprisonment of up to a period of two years or a fine up to fifty thousand rupees or both for a
vexatious search made without recording reasons in writing. It is submitted that providing a
punishment for a vexatious search is sufficient safeguard against the arbitrary exercise of power
of search by the concerned Authority**.
(xlii) He then went on to illustrate various safeguards contained in section 18 of the Act. It is
submitted that in terms of section 18(2), the Authority shall forward a copy of the reasons
recorded to the Adjudicating Authority in a sealed envelope to ensure that the records of search
and seizure are not tampered with. Other safeguards include the right of the

person to be searched to be taken to a Gazetted Officer or Magistrate before the search, if
such person so requires* ; and the right of the person to be searched to be released if there are
no reasonable grounds for search are found after the person is taken to a Gazetted Officer or
Magistrate* The PMLA also mandates the Authority to call at least two witnesses before a
search and conduct the search before such witnesses The Authority

any
property
during the search of a person is mandated to prepare a list of the record or the property seized
and get the same signed by the witnesses#. A female shall be searched only by a female##
Similar to the mandate of section 17(4), the provisions of section 18(10) also provide the
concerned person whose records or property are seized, an opportunity to show cause as to why
such records or property should not be retained.
(xliii) Lack of safeguards in the Cr. P. C. are also highlighted. With respect to seizures, it is
submitted that the same is governed by section 102 of the Cr. P. C., and empowers a police
officer to seize any property upon a mere suspicion. This is in stark contrast to section 17(1) of
the PMLA which permits seizure only when there is a reason to believe, and such reason is
recorded in writing. With respect to search, it is submitted that section 165 of the Cr. P. C.
practically permits any officer above the rank of constable to exercise such power, as opposed to
section 17 of the PMLA, which confers such power only upon the Director or any other officer not
below the rank of Deputy Director.
(xliv) In an attempt to establish that the power of search and seizure is not arbitrary, our
attention has been drawn to the decisions of this court in Pooran Mal (supra) ; ITO V. Seth
Brothers## and Dr. Partap Singh V. Director of Enforcement, Foreign Exchange Regulation
Act** The learned Additional Solicitor General further defends the power of the Authority to
search the place of a person without an FIR. It is submitted that the PMLA serves a two-fold
purpose of not only being penal, but also preventive in nature. In order to avoid a situation
where the property involved in money- laundering disappears or is disposed of before an FIR is
filed in respect of predicate offence, the PMLA empowers seizure without an FIR. Attention

Section 18(3). The inherent value of such a right has been recognised by this court in State of

is invited to section 17(1)(iv) of the PMLA, which uses the phrase "related to crime", and it is
submitted that the use of these words show that the Authority is empowered to seize such
properties without an FIR in order to ascertain whether such properties pertain to a scheduled
offence or whether such properties are proceeds of crime. The argument of the private parties
that the Authority under the PMLA cannot conduct a search on the same day without conducting
any investigation, is also rebutted by the learned Additional Solicitor General. It is submitted
that in light of the mandate to record the reasons to conduct the search/seizure in writing, such
an apprehension is ill-founded. Rather, a party aggrieved by the sufficiency or lack of such
reasons, always has the option to agitate the same before the Adjudicating Authority, when an
application for the retention of the records seized or frozen is filed.
(xlv) Lastly, it is submitted that by virtue of section 65 of the PMLA, the provisions of the Cr.
P. C. relating to search and seizure cannot be applied to proceedings under the Act. section 65 of
the PMLA states that the provisions of the Cr. P. C. shall apply subject to the condition that the
same are not inconsistent with those of the PMLA. It is submitted that the provisions contained
in sections 17 and 18 are self-contained with adequate safeguards, and will override the
provisions of the Cr. P. C. which are at variance.
(xlvi) In reply to the challenge of the private parties to the applicability of the proviso to rule
3
of the Seizure Rules, 2005, the learned Additional Solicitor General submits that the rules
framed under a statute cannot be ultra vires the statute. Prior to the amendment of section 17,
the proviso to section required that a report be forwarded to the Magistrate under section 157 of
the Cr. P. C. prior to the conduct of a search under section 17. After the amendment, the proviso
was removed, but a similar proviso continues to exists under rule 3 of the aforementioned rules.
Placing reliance on Union of India V. Purushottam*, it is submitted that rules must be
interpreted in a manner which would be in harmony with the parent statute, and, therefore, even
though the rules are unamended, the proviso to rule 3 cannot be read into the Act and is ultra
vires the Act.
(xlvii) The respondent has highlighted the legislative history of sections 5 and 8 of the PMLA.
It is submitted that sub-section (1) of section 5 has been amended four times in the years 2009,
2013, 2015 and 2018 respectively. It is stated that section 5(1) was amended vide the
Prevention of Money-Laundering (Amendment) Act, 2009 and second proviso was
inserted for the first time which made the provision for "immediate attachment" of the
property involved in money-laundering.
(xlviii) It was observed in the Mutual Evaluation Report of the FATF and the Asia Pacific Group
that the confiscation of criminal proceeds depends on conviction of the accused under the
scheduled offence, which gives rise to an apprehension of confiscation proceedings becoming
infructuous if the accused dies during the pendency of criminal proceedings. This technical
irregularity has a negative impact on the effectiveness of the confiscation regime ; therefore,
FATF recommended corrective steps to remove this irregularity. Accordingly, sections 5 and 8
were amended on the recommendation of FATF, as pointed out above.
(xlix) It is submitted that in the Fifty Sixth Report of the Standing Committee on Finance
relating to the 2011 Bill published by the Lok Sabha Secretariat on May 8, 2012, it was proposed
to delete the requirement of framing of charge under the scheduled offence against a person
before a property can be attached from such person, as in a given case a property may come to
rest with someone who has nothing to do with the scheduled offence or even with the offence of
money-laundering.
(I) It was further proposed to make confiscation of property independent of conviction of an
accused under the scheduled offence, as in a given case money-laundering may be done by a
person who has not committed the scheduled offence or property may come to rest with
someone who has not committed any offence. Therefore, to avoid such situations, section 8(5)
was proposed to be amended so as to provide for attachment and confiscation of the proceeds of
crime independent of conviction, so long as the predicate offence and the offence of money-
laundering have taken place and the property in question is involved in money-laundering.
Parliament acting on such recommendations amended sub-section (1) of section 5 vide the
Prevention of Money-Laundering (Amendment) Act, 2012 and deleted the requirement that
attachment can be made only qua the person who has been charged for committing the
scheduled offence. Further, section 8(3)(a) of the PMLA was also amended to provide that on
confirmation, the attachment would continue during the pendency of proceedings related to an
offence under the PMLA or under the corresponding law of any other country. Therefore, it is
averred that sections 5 and 8 of the PMLA, as they now stand, enable the attachment and
dispossession of the persons from the proceeds of crime without being dependent on the
proceedings of the scheduled offence, in consonance with the recommendations of the FATF and
global standards.
(li) Further to show the link between second proviso to section 5 and the scheduled offence, it
is submitted that the prerequisite for the application of "emergency attachment" provision under
second proviso to section 5 of the PMLA is that the Authority concerned must have some material
in its possession showing that such property is involved in money- laundering, which clearly
establishes the link of second proviso with the scheduled offence. Relying on sub-section (5) of
section 8, it is averred that the properties which can be confiscated are properties involved in
money- laundering and also the properties used for the commission of the offence of money-
laundering. It is submitted that the ambit of sub-section (1) of section 5 is very wide, which not
only covers persons who are involved in the commission of scheduled offence, but also any
person in possession of the proceeds of crime, who need not be the person accused of the PMLA
offence or who is being tried for the scheduled offence. It is further submitted that it would not
be correct to say that "any property" of "any person" can be attached by invoking the second
proviso to section 5, as the proviso only deals with the property which is involved in money-
laundering. Further, it is stated that the person whose property is sought to be attached may not
be charged under the scheduled offence. Therefore, it is urged that the scheme of second proviso
is consistent with section 5(1) of the PMLA. It is also submitted that under the second proviso
Parliament has provided various safeguards in the form of conditions that have to be satisfied
before the power under the proviso can be invoked. It is stated that firstly, the power of
provisional attachment can only be exercised by a high-ranking officer ; secondly, such officer
has to record the "reasons to believe" that the property is proceeds of crime or involved in
money-laundering and lastly, he should be satisfied that if the property is not attached
immediately, the confiscation proceedings under the PMLA will get frustrated. Further, it is
submitted that such belief must be formed on the basis of material in the possession of the
officer. It is then submitted that the expression "property involved in money-laundering" under
the second proviso to section 5 is wide enough to cover the proceeds of crime as well. Therefore,
it is submitted that only the property that is involved in the money-laundering can be attached
under the second proviso and not "any property". It is urged that the ambit of second proviso to
section 5 is wider than that of main provision of section 5 itself, as second proviso enables the
attachment of "any property involved in money-laundering", whereas the main provision only
allows the attachment of "proceeds of crime".
(lii) It is contended that although the function of a proviso is to add something or to carve out
an exception on a subject not covered by the
main section, however, in many cases, courts have treated even a proviso as "a substantive
provision conferring substantive powers"* It is further submitted that even section 8(5), on
the
conclusion of the trial, not only permits confiscation of property involved in money-laundering
but also the property used for the commission of the offence of money-laundering. Therefore,
such interpretation of the second proviso to section 5 of the PMLA is consistent with the entire
scheme of the Act.
(liii) The learned Additional Solicitor General has further refuted the argument of the private
parties that the attachment of property equivalent in value of the proceeds of crime can only be
done if the proceeds of crime are situated outside India. It is stated that it is manifest from the
definition of "proceeds of crime" under section 2(1)(u) of the PMLA that the proceeds of crime
would not only cover the concerned property, but also the value of such property. It is further
submitted that the attachment of property under second proviso is in consonance with the object
of the PMLA. Reliance has been placed on Attorney General for India V. Amratlal Prajivandas**,
wherein the court upheld the constitutionality of definition of "illegally acquired property" and
application of SAFEMA to the relatives and associates of detenues. Further, Order 38 Rule 5 of
the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908*** has also been relied upon to state that the attachment of
property can also be done before judgment, so as to secure the subject matter of the suit during
the pendency of the suit#. It is submitted that the object of section 5(1) is similar to that of
Order 38 rule 5 which is to secure the properties from getting disposed of before the confiscation
of such property.
(liv) The respondent has further highlighted the procedural safeguards given under second
proviso to section 5(1) of the PMLA. It is submitted that the Authority under the Act will have to
first apply its mind to the materials on record and record its reasons to believe in writing before
taking any further action. Secondly, the Authority must be satisfied that if property will not be
immediately attached, the confiscation proceedings might get frustrated. Thirdly, it is stated
that order under section 5(1) is only a provisional order which is valid only for 180 days, subject
to the confirmation of Adjudicating Authority. Fourthly, a copy of the order of provisional
attachment is to be forwarded to the Adjudicating Authority in a sealed envelope. Fifthly, the
Authority is mandated to file a complaint

Duties V. Atwill (1973) 1 All ER 576.

before the Adjudicating Authority within 30 days of the order of the provisional attachment.
Sixthly, it is stated that the life of a provisional attachment order is 180 days or the date when
the Adjudicating Authority makes an order under section 8(2) of the PMLA, whichever is earlier.
Seventhly, a show-cause notice is served on the aggrieved person, calling upon such person to
indicate the sources of his income, earning or assets or by means of which he has acquired the
property attached under section 5(1) of the PMLA. Therefore, it is submitted that the PMLA
ensures that the principles of natural justice do not get violated. Eighthly, the noticee will have
the opportunity to produce evidence on which he relies before the Adjudicating Authority.
Ninthly, it is stated that due procedure is followed by the Adjudicating Authority which hear both
the parties before passing any order.
(Iv) Further, under section 8(6) of the PMLA, the Special Court is empowered to release the
property if after the conclusion of the trial it is found that no offence of money-laundering has
taken place or the property is not involved in money-laundering.
(Ivi) Next, the learned Additional Solicitor General highlights the provisions for challenging
the orders passed by the Adjudicating Authority. It is submitted that the order passed by the
Adjudicating Authority is subject to appeal before the Appellate Tribunal. Also, the order passed
by the Tribunal is appealable under section 42 of the PMLA before the High Court on any
question of fact or question of law. Therefore, it is submitted that the ED cannot attach any
property on its whims and fancies. Further, PMLA ensures ample judicial scrutiny of the order of
attachment.
(Ivii) It is submitted that even a third party has the right to challenge the provisional
attachment order under section 8(2) of the PMLA and if the Adjudicating Authority is satisfied
that the property is not involved in money-laundering and the claim of the third party is
legitimate one, then it may release such property from attachment. Reliance has been placed on
Radha Mohan Lakhotia V. Deputy Director, PMLA, Directorate of Enforcement* to state that the
Bombay High Court has even before the amendment of section 5(1), held that a provisional
attachment order can even be passed against the person who is not named as an accused in the
commission of scheduled offence. Further it is stated that the High Courts in the following cases,
while relying on Radha Mohan Lakhotia (supra), have upheld the validity of section 5(1) of the
PMLA : B. Rama Raju V.
Union of India*, Alive Hospitality and Food P. Ltd. V. Union of India. K. Sowbaghya V.
Union of India***, Usha Agarwal V. Union of India# and J. Sekar V. Union of India##.
(Iviii) With regard to the constitutional validity of section 8, it is submitted that "no person
has a right to enjoy the fruits of a property which is the product of crime".
(lix) It is submitted that the possession of the property involved in money-laundering can be
validly taken before the conviction of a person for the offence of money-laundering, as the non-
conviction-based asset forfeiture model, also known as civil forfeiture legislation, is prevalent
even in countries such as United States of America, Italy, Ireland, South Africa, UK, Australia
and certain provinces of Canada. Further, it is stated that the confiscation of property without
conviction under section 8(4) is in consonance with Recommendation No. 3 of FATF
(2003)/Recommendation No. 4 of FATF (2012).
(Ix) It is further submitted that non-conviction-based attachment and taking possession of
property cannot be considered as unconstitutional, since such property can only be confiscated
upon conclusion of trial leading to conviction, as provided under section 8(5) of the PMLA. It is
averred that the judicial oversight of the Adjudicating Authority is an adequate safeguard
provided under the Act.
(Ixi) The respondent has relied on Biswanath Bhattacharya V. Union of India### to urge that
the sovereign would be completely justified in confiscating a property which is obtained by a
person through illegal means*# It is further submitted that the Taking Possession Rules, 2013
provides that before eviction of a person from the concerned property a notice of 10 days' time
has to be served upon him, which is an adequate safeguard provided under the Act as it enables
the aggrieved person to take a suitable action under section 26 of the PMLA.
(Ixii) It is further pointed out that before the confirmation of the attachment order, any
person having an interest in the property have the opportunity of being heard by the
Adjudicating Authority. Therefore, it is submitted that the power conferred by section 8(4) of the
PMLA to
dispossess a person in possession of "proceeds of crime" or "the property involved in money-
laundering" even before the conviction is perfectly valid, reasonable and justified.
(Ixiii) To counter the argument of the private parties that the attachment of the property will
lapse if no proceedings is initiated under the Act by way of filing a complaint before the Special
Court before the expiry of three hundred and sixty-five days of the attachment, it is submitted
that the period of attachment under section 8(3) of the PMLA will be three hundred and sixty-
five days or during the pendency of "any proceedings" which includes any proceeding including
of bail, quashing, etc.
(Ixiv) It is submitted that the expression "pendency of proceedings" relating to an offence
under the PMLA before a court is broad enough to mean any pending proceedings relating to an
offence under the Act*. Therefore, it is stated that even if for some reason a complaint has not
been filed after three hundred and sixty-five days from the date of attachment then such
attachment should not lapse.
(Ixv) It is submitted that when a provisional attachment order is finally confirmed, then no
person can claim any right, title or interest to the proceeds of crime or property involved in
money-laundering. Therefore, only on a conclusion of trial under the Act and upon a finding by
the Special Court that the offence of money-laundering has not taken place or the property is not
involved in money-laundering, an order for release of such property can be made.
(Ixvi) Further, it is stated a person may file frivolous litigations so as to prolong the
proceedings. Therefore, section 8(3)(a) requires a broad construction so as to deny the money-
launderer from enjoying the proceeds of crime. It is stated that the object of the Act is also
manifest from section 8(7) where even after the death of the accused the proceeds of crime or
property involved in money-laundering can be confiscated upon an order of the Special Court.
Therefore, for the abovementioned reasons, it is stated that the expression "during the pendency
of the proceedings" requires a broad construction.

The 2002 Act
19. The Act was enacted to address the urgent need to have a comprehensive legislation, inter
alia, for preventing money-laundering, attachment of proceeds of crime, adjudication and
confiscation thereof including vesting of it in the Central Government, setting up of agencies and
mechanisms for co-ordinating measures for combating money-laundering and also to prosecute the
persons indulging in the process or activity connected with the proceeds of crime. This need was
felt world over owing to the serious threat to the financial systems of the countries, including to
their integrity and sovereignty because of money-laundering. The international community
deliberated over the dispensation to be provided to address the serious threat posed by the process
and activities connected with the proceeds of crime and integrating it with formal financial systems
of the countries. The issues were debated threadbare in the United Nation Convention Against Illicit
Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances, Basle Statement of Principles enunciated in
1989, the FATF established at the summit of seven major industrial nations held in Paris from 14th
to 16th July, 1989, the Political Declaration and Noble Programme of Action adopted by United
Nations General Assembly vide its Resolution No. S-17/2 of February 23, 1990, the United Nations
in the Special Session on countering World Drug Problem Together concluded on the 8th to 10th
June, 1998, urging the State parties to enact a comprehensive legislation. This is evident from the
introduction and Statement of Objects and Reasons accompanying the Bill which became the 2002
Act. The same reads thus :
"Introduction
Money-laundering poses a serious threat not only to the financial systems of countries, but
also to their integrity and sovereignty. To obviate such threats international community has
taken some initiatives. It has been felt that to prevent money-laundering and connected
activities a comprehensive legislation is urgently needed. To achieve this objective the
Prevention of Money-laundering Bill, 1998 was introduced in Parliament. The Bill was referred to
the Standing Committee on Finance, which presented its report on March 4, 1999 to the Lok
Sabha. The Central Government broadly accepted the recommendation of the Standing
Committee and incorporated them in the said Bill along with some other desired changes.
Statement of objects and reasons
It is being realised, world over, that money-laundering poses a serious threat not only to
the financial systems of countries, but also to their integrity and sovereignty. Some of the
initiatives taken by the international community to obviate such threat are outlined below --
(a) the United Nations Convention Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and
Psychotropic Substances, to which India is a party, calls for prevention of laundering of
proceeds of drug crimes and other connected activities and confiscation of proceeds derived
from such offence.
(b) the Base Statement of Principles, enunciated in 1989, outlined basic policies and
procedures that banks should follow in order to assist the law enforcement agencies in
tackling the problem of money- laundering.
(c) the Financial Action Task Force established at the summit of seven major industrial
nations, held in Paris from 14th to 16th July, 1989, to examine the problem of money-
laundering has made forty recommendations, which provide the foundation material for
comprehensive legislation to combat the problem of money-laundering. The
recommendations were classified under various heads. Some of the important heads are-
(i) declaration of laundering of monies carried through serious crimes a criminal
offence ;
(ii) to work out modalities of disclosure by financial institutions regarding reportable
transactions ;
(iii) confiscation of the proceeds of crime ;
(iv) declaring money-laundering to be an extraditable offence ; and
(v) promoting international co-operation in investigation of money-laundering.
(d) the Political Declaration and Global Programme of Action adopted by United Nations
General Assembly by its Resolution No. S- 17/2 of February 23, 1990, inter alia, calls upon the
member States to develop mechanism to prevent financial institutions from being used for
laundering of drug related money and enactment of legislation to prevent such laundering.
(e) the United Nations in the Special Session on countering World Drug Problem Together
concluded on the 8th to 10th June, 1998 has made another declaration regarding the need to
combat money-laundering. India is a signatory to this declaration.
2. In view of an urgent need for the enactment or a comprehensive legislation, inter alia, for
preventing money-laundering and connected activities confiscation of proceeds of crime, setting
up of agencies and mechanisms for co-ordinating measures for combating money-laundering,
etc., the Prevention of Money-Laundering Bill, 1998 was introduced in the Lok Sabha on the
August 4, 1998. The Bill was referred to the Standing Committee on Finance, which presented
its report on the March 4, 1999 to the Lok Sabha. The recommendations of the Standing
Committee accepted by the Central Government are that (a) the expressions 'banking company'
and 'person' may be defined ; (b) in Part I of the Schedule under Indian Penal Code the word
offence under section 477A relating to falsification of accounts should be omitted ; (c)
'knowingly' be inserted in clause 3(b) relating to the definition of money-laundering ; (d) the
banking companies financial institutions and intermediaries should be required to furnish
information of transactions to the Director instead of Commissioner of Income-tax ; (e) the
banking companies should also be brought within the ambit of clause II relating to obligations of
financial institutions and intermediaries ; (f) a definite time-limit of 24 hours should be provided
for producing a person about to be searched or arrested person before the Gazetted Officer or
Magistrate ; (g) the words 'unless otherwise proved to the satisfaction of the authority
concerned" may be inserted in clause 22 relating to presumption on inter-connected
transactions ; (h) vacancy in the office of the Chairperson of an Appellate Tribunal, by reason of
his death, resignation or otherwise, the senior-most member shall act as the Chairperson till the
date on which a new Chairperson appointed in accordance with the provisions of this Act to fill
the vacancy, enters upon his office ; (i) the appellant before the Appellate Tribunal may be
authorised to engage any authorised representative as defined under section 288 of the Income-
tax Act, 1961 ; (j) the punishment for vexatious search and for false information may be
enhanced from three months imprisonment to two years imprisonment, or fine of rupees ten
thousand to fine of rupees fifty thousand or both ; (k) the word 'good faith" may be incorporated
in the clause relating to Bar of legal proceedings. The Central Government have broadly accepted
the above recommendations and made provisions of the said recommendations in the Bill.
3. In addition to above recommendations of the standing committee the Central Government
proposes to (a) relax the conditions
prescribed for grant of bail so that the Court may grant bail to a person who is below sixteen
years of age, or woman, or sick or infirm, (b) levy of fine for default of non-compliance of the
issue of summons, etc., (c) make provisions for having reciprocal arrangement for assistance in
certain matters and procedure for attachment and confiscation of property so as to facilitate the
transfer of funds involved in money-laundering kept outside the country and extradition of the
accused persons from abroad.
4. The Bill seeks to achieve the above objects. (emphasis supplied)
Notably, before coming into force of the 2002 Act, various other legislations were already in
vogue to deal with attachment and confiscation/forfeiture of the proceeds of crime linked to
concerned offences and yet another added recently in 2016, such as :
(a) The Forfeiture Act, 1857 (Repealed in 1922) ;
(b) the Criminal Law Amendment Ordinance, 1944 ;
(c) the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967 (Chapter V inserted in 2013) ;
(d) the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972 (Chapter VIA inserted in 2003)
;
(e) the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (Chapter XXXIV - Disposal of Property) ;
(f) the Smugglers and Foreign Exchange Manipulators (Forfeiture of Property) Act, 1976 ;
(g) the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985 (Chapter VA inserted in
1989) ;
(h) the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988 (section 5(6)) ;
(i) the Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act, 1999 (section 20) (While this is a State
law, it has been adopted by several States, or has served as a model law for other States) ; and
(j) the Anti-Hijacking Act, 2016 (section 19).
As aforesaid, notwithstanding the existing dispensation to deal with proceeds of crime,
Parliament enacted the Act as a result of international commitment to sternly deal with the
menace of money-laundering of proceeds of crime having transnational consequences and on the
financial systems of the countries. The Prevention of Money-laundering Bill was passed by both
the Houses of Parliament and received the assent of President on
January 17, 2003. It came into force on July 1, 2005 titled "The Prevention of Money-
Laundering Act, 2002 (15 of 2003)".
20. The broad framework of the 2002 Act is that it consists of ten chapters. Chapter I deals with
the short title, extent and commencement and definitions. Chapter II deals with offence of money-
laundering. Chapter III deals with the mechanism of attachment, adjudication and confiscation.
Chapter IV deals with obligations of the banking companies, financial institutions and
intermediaries. Chapter V is in respect of steps and safeguards to be taken for issuing summons,
carrying out searches and seizures including power to arrest, presumptions and burden of proof.
Chapter VI deals with the matters concerning Appellate Tribunal. Chapter VII deals with matters
concerning Special Courts. Chapter VIII is regarding the Authorities under the Act and their
jurisdiction and powers. Chapter IX deals with reciprocal arrangement for assistance in certain
matters and procedure for attachment and confiscation of property. Chapter X deals with
miscellaneous and incidental matters. In terms of section 73 in this Chapter, the Central
Government has made rules for carrying out the provisions of the Act. The said rules deal with
different aspects, namely :
(a) The Prevention of Money-Laundering (the Manner of Forwarding a Copy of the Order of
Provisional Attachment of Property along with the Material, and Copy of the Reasons along with
the Material in respect of Survey, to the Adjudicating Authority and its period of Retention)
Rules, 2005 ;
(b) The Prevention of Money-Laundering (Receipt and Management of Confiscated Properties)

(c) The Prevention of Money-Laundering (Maintenance of Records) Rules, 2005 as amended by
(Fifth Amendment) Rules, 2019 ;

Manner of Forwarding the Reasons and Material to the Adjudicating Authority, Impounding and
Custody of Records and the Period of Retention) Rules, 2005 ;

Confirmed by the Adjudicating Authority) Rules, 2013 ;
(m) The Prevention of Money-Laundering (Restoration of Property) Rules, 2016 as amended
by (Amendment) Rules, 2019.
We may further note that the 2002 Act has been amended from time-to- time to address the
exigencies and for the need to strengthen the mechanisms as per the recommendations made
by the international body to address the scourge of laundering of proceeds of crime affecting the
financial systems and also integrity and sovereignty of the country. The list of amending Acts is
as follows :
(a) The Prevention of Money-Laundering (Amendment) Act, 2005 (20 of 2005) (with effect
from July 1, 2005) ;
(b) The Prevention of Money-Laundering (Amendment) Act, 2009 (21 of 2009) (with effect
from June 1, 2009) ;
(c) The Prevention of Money-Laundering (Amendment) Act, 2012 (2 of 2013) (with effect
from February 15, 2013) ;
(d) The Finance Act, 2015 (20 of 2015) (with effect from May 14, 2015) ;

25, 2019) ; and
(k) The Finance (No. 2) Act, 2019 (23 of 2019) (with effect from August 1, 2019).
21. The petitioners have questioned the amendments brought about by Parliament by taking
recourse to the Finance Bill/Money Bill. At the outset, it was made clear to all concerned that the
said ground of challenge will not be examined in the present proceedings as it is pending for
consideration before the larger Bench of this court (seven judges) in view of the reference order
passed in Rojer Mathew (supra). We are conscious of the fact that if that ground of challenge is to
be accepted, it may go to the root of the matter and amendments effected vide Finance Act would
become unconstitutional or ineffective. Despite that, it had become necessary to answer the other
contentions which may otherwise require consideration in the event of the principal ground of
challenge is answered against the petitioners. In any case, until the larger Bench decides that issue
authoritatively, the authorities and the Adjudicating Authority as well as the courts are obliged to
give effect to the amended provisions. Resultantly, the other issues raised in this batch of cases
being recurring and as are involved in large number of cases to be dealt with by the authorities and
the Adjudicating Authority under the Act and the concerned courts on daily basis, including the
Constitutional Courts, it has become necessary to answer the other grounds of challenge in the
meantime. On that understanding, we proceeded with the hearing of the batch of cases before us
to deal with the other challenges regarding the concerned provision(s) being otherwise
unconstitutional and ultra vires.
22. We do not deem it necessary to deal with the factual matrix involved in the concerned case.
For, after answering the issues regarding the validity as dealt with herein, including interpretation
of the concerned provision(s), the petitioners can be relegated to pursue their other remedies (such
as for bail, quashing, discharge, etc.), before the appropriate forum.
Preamble of the 2002 Act
23. The Preamble of the 2002 Act reads thus :
"An Act to prevent money-laundering and to provide for confiscation of property derived from,
or involved in, money-laundering and for matters connected therewith or incidental thereto.
Whereas the Political Declaration and Global Programme of Action, annexed to the resolution S
-17/2 was adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations at its seventeenth special
session on the twenty-third day of February, 1990 ;
And whereas the Political Declaration adopted by the Special Session of the United Nations
General Assembly held on 8th to 10th June, 1998 calls upon the Member States to adopt
national money- laundering legislation and programme ;
And whereas it is considered necessary to implement the aforesaid resolution and the
Declaration."
Even the Preamble of the Act reinforces the background in which the Act has been enacted by
Parliament being commitment of the country to the international community. It is crystal clear
from the Preamble that the Act has been enacted to prevent money-laundering and to provide
for confiscation of property derived from or involved in money-laundering and for matters
connected therewith or incidental thereto. It is neither a pure regulatory legislation nor a pure
penal legislation. It is amalgam of several facets essential to address the scourge of money-
laundering as such. In one sense, it is a sui generis legislation.
24. As aforesaid, it is a comprehensive legislation dealing with all the related issues concerning
prevention of money-laundering, attachment of proceeds of crime, adjudication and confiscation
thereof including vesting of it in the Central Government, setting up of agencies and mechanisms
for co- ordinating measures for combating money-laundering and also to prosecute the persons
indulging in the process or activity connected with the proceeds of crime. While considering the
challenge to the relevant provision(s) of the 2002 Act, we cannot be oblivious to the objects and
reasons for enacting such a special legislation and the seriousness of the issues to be dealt with
thereunder including having transnational implications. Every provision in the 2002 Act will have to
be given its due significance while keeping in mind the legislative intent for providing a special
mechanism to deal with the scourge of money-laundering recognised world over and with the need
to deal with it sternly.
Definition clause
25. Section 2 defines some of the expressions used in the relevant provision(s) of the 2002 Act.
We may usefully refer to some of the expressions defined in this section having bearing on the
matters in issue, namely (as amended from time-to-time)-
"2. Definitions.-(1) In this Act, unless the context otherwise requires,

##Explanation.-Fo the removal of doubts, it is hereby clarified that 'proceeds of crime'

(zb) 'value' means the fair market value of any property on the date of its acquisition by any

such person."
26. We would now elaborate upon the meaning of "investigation" in clause (na) of section 2(1).
It includes all proceedings under the Act conducted by the Director or an authority authorised by
the Central Government under this Act for collection of evidence. The expression "all the
proceedings under this Act" unquestionably refers to the action of attachment, adjudication and
confiscation, as well as actions undertaken by the designated authorities mentioned in Chapter VIII
of
the Act, under Chapter V of the Act, and for facilitating the adjudication by the Adjudicating
Authority referred to in Chapter III to adjudicate the matters in issue, including until the filing of
the complaint by the authority authorised in that behalf before the Special Courts constituted under
Chapter VII of the Act. The expression "proceedings", therefore, need not be given a narrow
meaning only to limit
* Inserted by Act 2 of 2013, section 2(x) (with effect from 15-2-2013, vide S. O. 343(E), dated 8-2

# Substituted by Act 21 of 2009.
it to proceedings before the court or before the Adjudicating Authority as is contended but must be
understood contextually. This is reinforced from the scheme of the Act as it recognises that the
statement recorded by the Director in the course of inquiry, to be deemed to be judicial
proceedings in terms of section 50(4) of the 2002 Act. Needless to underscore that the authorities
referred to in section 48 of the Act are distinct from the Adjudicating Authority referred to in
section 6 of the 2002 Act. The Adjudicating Authority referred to in section 6 is entrusted with the
task of adjudicating the matters in issue for confirmation of the provisional attachment order issued
under section 5 of the 2002 Act, passed by the Authority referred to in section 48 of the Act. The
confirmation of provisional attachment order is done by the Adjudicating Authority under section 8
of the 2002 Act, and if confirmed, the property in question is ordered to be confiscated and then it
would vest in the Central Government as per section 9 of the 2002 Act subject to the outcome of
the trial of the offence under the 2002 Act (i. e., section 3 of offence of money-laundering
punishable under section 4). Suffice it to observe that the expression "proceedings" must be given
expansive meaning to include actions of the authorities (i. e., section 48) and of the Adjudicating
Authority (i. e., section 6), including before the Special Court (i. e., section 43).
27. The task of the Director or an authority authorised by the Central Government under the
2002 Act for the collection of evidence is the intrinsic process of adjudication proceedings. In that,
the evidence so collected by the authorities is placed before the Adjudicating Authority for
determination of the issue as to whether the provisional attachment order issued under section 5
deserves to be confirmed and to direct confiscation of the property in question. The expression
"investigation", therefore, must be regarded as interchangeable with the function of "inquiry" to be
undertaken by the authorities for submitting such evidence before the Adjudicating Authority.
28. In other words, merely because the expression used is "investigation" - which is similar to
the one noted in section 2(h) of the 1973 Code, it does not limit itself to matter of investigation
concerning the offence under the Act and section 3 in particular. It is a different matter that the
material collected during the inquiry by the authorities is utilised to bolster the allegation in the
complaint to be filed against the person from whom the property has been recovered, being the
proceeds of crime. Further, the expression "investigation" used in the 2002 Act is interchangeable
with the function of "inquiry" to be undertaken by the Authorities under the Act, including
collection of evidence for being presented to the Adjudicating
Authority for its consideration for confirmation of provisional attachment order. We need to keep in
mind that the expanse of the provisions of the 2002 Act is of prevention of money-laundering,
attachment of proceeds of crime, adjudication and confiscation thereof, including vesting of it in the
Central Government and also setting up of agency and mechanism for co- ordinating measures for
combating money-laundering.
29. Coming to the next relevant definition is expression "money-laundering", it has the meaning
assigned to it in section 3 of the Act. We would dilate on this aspect while dealing with the purport
of section 3 of the Act a little later.
30. The other relevant definition is "proceeds of crime" in section 2(1)(u) of the 2002 Act. This
definition is common to all actions under the Act, namely, attachment, adjudication and
confiscation being civil in nature as well as prosecution or criminal action. The original provision
prior to amendment vide Finance Act, 2015 and the Finance (No. 2) Act, 2019, took within its
sweep any property (mentioned in section 2(1)(v) of the Act) derived or obtained, directly or
indirectly, by any person "as a result of" criminal activity "relating to" a scheduled offence
(mentioned in section 2(1)(y) read with Schedule to the Act) or the value of any such property.
Vide Finance Act, 2015, it further included such property (being proceeds of crime) which is taken
or held outside the country, then the property equivalent in value held within the country and by
further amendment vide Act 13 of 2018, it also added property which is abroad. By further
amendment vide Finance (No. 2) Act, 2019, Explanation has been added which is obviously a
clarificatory amendment. That is evident from the plain language of the inserted Explanation itself.
The fact that it also includes any property which may, directly or indirectly, be derived as a result of
any criminal activity relatable to scheduled offence does not transcend beyond the original
provision. In that, the word "relating to" (associated with/has to do with) used in the main
provision is a present participle of word "relate" and the word "relatable" is only an adjective. The
thrust of the original provision itself is to indicate that any property is derived or obtained, directly
or indirectly, as a result of criminal activity concerning the scheduled offence, the same be
regarded as proceeds of crime. In other words, property in whatever form mentioned in section 2
(1)(v), is or can be linked to criminal activity relating to or relatable to scheduled offence, must be
regarded as proceeds of crime for the purpose of the 2002 Act. It must follow that the Explanation
inserted in 2019 is merely clarificatory and restatement of the position emerging from the principal
provision (i. e., section 2(1)(u)).
31. The "proceeds of crime" being the core of the ingredients constituting the offence of money-
laundering, that expression needs to be construed strictly. In that, all properties recovered or
attached by the investigating agency in connection with the criminal activity relating to a scheduled
offence under the general law cannot be regarded as proceeds of crime. There may be cases where
the property involved in the commission of scheduled offence attached by the investigating agency
dealing with that offence, cannot be wholly or partly regarded as proceeds of crime within the
meaning of section 2(1)(u) of the 2002 Act-so long as the whole or some portion of the property
has been derived or obtained by any person "as a result of" criminal activity relating to the stated
scheduled offence. To be proceeds of crime, therefore, the property must be derived or obtained,
directly or indirectly, "as a result of" criminal activity relating to a scheduled offence. To put it
differently, the vehicle used in commission of scheduled offence may be attached as property in the
concerned case (crime), it may still not be proceeds of crime within the meaning of section 2(1)(u)
of the 2002 Act. Similarly, possession of unaccounted property acquired by legal means may be
actionable for tax violation and yet, will not be regarded as proceeds of crime unless the concerned
tax legislation prescribes such violation as an offence and such offence is included in the Schedule
of the 2002 Act. For being regarded as proceeds of crime, the property associated with the
scheduled offence must have been derived or obtained by a person "as a result of" criminal activity
relating to the concerned scheduled offence. This distinction must be borne in mind while reckoning
any property referred to in the scheduled offence as proceeds of crime for the purpose of the 2002
Act. Dealing with proceeds of crime by way of any process or activity constitutes offence of money-
laundering under section 3 of the Act.
32. Be it noted that the definition clause includes any property derived or obtained "indirectly"
as well. This would include property derived or obtained from the sale proceeds or in a given case in
lieu of or in exchange of the "property" which had been directly derived or obtained as a result of
criminal activity relating to a scheduled offence. In the context of Explanation added in 2019 to the
definition of expression "proceeds of crime", it would inevitably include other property which may
not have been derived or obtained as a result of any criminal activity relatable to the scheduled
offence. As noticed from the definition, it essentially refers to "any property" including abroad
derived or obtained directly or indirectly. The Explanation added in 2019 in no way travels beyond
that intent of tracking and reaching up to the property derived or obtained directly or indirectly as a
result of criminal activity relating to a scheduled offence. Therefore, the Explanation is in the nature
of clarification and not to increase the width of the main definition "proceeds of crime". The
definition of "property" also contains Explanation which is for the removal of doubts and to clarify
that the term property includes property of any kind used in the commission of an offence under
the 2002 Act or any of the scheduled offences. In the earlier part of this judgment, we have already
noted that every crime property need not be termed as proceeds of crime but the converse may be
true. Additionally, some other property is purchased or derived from the proceeds of crime even
such subsequently acquired property must be regarded as tainted property and actionable under
the Act. For, it would become property for the purpose of taking action under the 2002 Act which is
being used in the commission of offence of money-laundering. Such purposive interpretation would
be necessary to uphold the purposes and objects for enactment of 2002 Act.
33. Tersely put, it is only such property which is derived or obtained, directly or indirectly, as a
result of criminal activity relating to a scheduled offence can be regarded as proceeds of crime. The
authorities under the 2002 Act cannot resort to action against any person for money-laundering on
an assumption that the property recovered by them must be proceeds of crime and that a
scheduled offence has been committed, unless the same is registered with the jurisdictional police
or pending inquiry by way of complaint before the competent forum. For, the expression "derived or
obtained" is indicative of criminal activity relating to a scheduled offence already accomplished.
Similarly, in the event the person named in the criminal activity relating to a scheduled offence is
finally absolved by a court of competent jurisdiction owing to an order of discharge, acquittal or
because of quashing of the criminal case (scheduled offence) against him/her, there can be no
action for money-laundering against such a person or person claiming through him in relation to
the property linked to the stated scheduled offence. This interpretation alone can be countenanced
on the basis of the provisions of the 2002 Act, in particular section 2(1)(u) read with section 3.
Taking any other view would be rewriting of these provisions and disregarding the express
language of definition clause "proceeds of crime", as it obtains as of now.
34. By and large the debate today is restricted to the discrepancy between the word "and",
which features in the original definition, against the "or" in the newly inserted Explanation in
section 3. While the stand of the Government is that there is no requirement under section 3 to
project or claim the proceeds of crime as untainted property. The petitioners have claimed that said
interpretation will be unconstitutional. For, the requirement is that not only does a predicate crime
need to be committed, it in turn needs to generate proceeds of crime and it must also then be
projected as untainted property to qualify for the crime of money-laundering. The general scheme
of the law of this land is that any law which is questioned is presumed to be unblemished and
within the confines of the constitutional principles so laid down within the Constitution. Yet, as the
arguments, challenges laid against the interpretation of the impugned section are so many we find
it necessary to see how India embarked on the framing of the definition of "money-laundering"
under section 3 of the 2002 Act. Thereafter, we will see how Parliament over the years responded to
changes and suggestions from the outside world, notably the FATF. Thus, in seriatim we endeavour
to see the international Conventions which led to the evolution of money-laundering, based on
which the Government decided to enact the law, followed by the FATF recommendations which
have led to the amendments, then the debates in Parliament of India followed by the law of the
land as laid down by this court.
35. For untying the knot, how money-laundering evolved-it is trite to refer to the tenets that
have been laid down in what are commonly referred to as the Palermo and Vienna Conventions. The
first step ever taken towards ridding the world of money-laundering were made in the Vienna
Convention, 1988 wherein under articles 3.1(b)(i), (ii), (c)( (i) to (iv), 3.2 and 3.3, it was held as
follows
"Article 3
Offences and sanctions
1. Each Party shall adopt such measures as may be necessary to establish as criminal offences
under its domestic law, when committed intentionally
(b) (i) The conversion or transfer of property, knowing that such property is derived from any
offence or offences established in accordance with sub-paragraph (a) of this paragraph, or from
an act of participation in such offence or offences, for the purpose of concealing or disguising the
illicit origin of the property or of assisting any person who is involved in the commission of such
an offence or offences to evade the legal consequences of his actions ;
(ii) The concealment or disguise of the true nature, source, location, disposition, movement,
rights with respect to, or ownership of property, knowing that such property is derived from an
offence or offences established in accordance with sub-paragraph (a) of this paragraph or from
an act of participation in such an offence or offences ;
(c) Subject to its constitutional principles and the basic concepts of its legal system
:
(i) The acquisition, possession or use of property, knowing, at the time of receipt, that such
property was derived from an offence or offences established in accordance with sub-paragraph
(a) of this paragraph or from an act of participation in such offence or offences ;
(ii) The possession of equipment or materials or substances listed in Table I and Table II,
knowing that they are being or are to be used in or for the illicit cultivation, production or
(iii) Publicly inciting or inducing others, by any means, to commit any of the offences
established in accordance with this article or to use narcotic drugs or psychotropic substances
illicitly ;
(iv) Participation in, association or conspiracy to commit, attempts to commit and aiding,
abetting, facilitating and counselling the commission of any of the offences established in
accordance with this article.
2. Subject to its constitutional principles and the basic concepts of its legal system, each
Party shall adopt such measures as may be necessary to establish as a criminal offence under its
domestic law, when committed intentionally, the possession, purchase or cultivation of narcotic
drugs or psychotropic substances for personal consumption contrary to the provisions of the
1961 Convention, the 1961 Convention as amended or the 1971 Convention.
(3) Knowledge, intent or purpose required as an element of an offence set forth in paragraph
1 of this article may be inferred from objective factual circumstances." (emphasis supplied)
Similarly, the next important Convention which bolstered the fight against money-laundering
was the Palermo Convention wherein in annexure I it is stated that :
"Article 2 Use of terms
(a) to (d)
(e) 'Proceeds of crime' shall mean any property derived from or obtained, directly or
indirectly, through the commission of an offence ;
(h) "Predicate offence" shall mean any offence as a result of which proceeds have been
generated that may become the subject of an offence as defined in article 6 of this Convention
Article 6 Criminalization of the laundering of proceeds of crime
1. Each State Party shall adopt, in accordance with fundamental principles of its domestic law,
such legislative and other measures as may be necessary to establish as criminal offences, when
committed intentionally :
(a) (i) The conversion or transfer of property, knowing that such property is the proceeds of
crime, for the purpose of concealing or disguising the illicit origin of the property or of helping
any person who is involved in the commission of the predicate offence to evade the legal
consequences of his or her action ;
(ii) The concealment or disguise of the true nature, source, location, disposition, movement or
ownership of or rights with respect to property, knowing that such property is the proceeds of
crime ;
(b) Subject to the basic concepts of its legal system :
(i) The acquisition, possession or use of property, knowing, at the time of receipt, that such
property is the proceeds of crime ;
(ii) Participation in, association with or conspiracy to commit, attempts to commit and aiding,
abetting, facilitating and counselling the commission of any of the offences established in
accordance with this article.
2. For purposes of implementing or applying paragraph 1 of this article :
(a) Each State Party shall seek to apply paragraph 1 of this article to the widest range of
predicate offences ;
(b) Each State Party shall include as predicate offences all serious crime as defined in article 2
of this Convention and the offences established in accordance with articles 5, 8 and 23 of this
Convention. In the case of States Parties whose legislation sets out a list of specific predicate
offences, they shall, at a minimum, include in such list a comprehensive range of offences
associated with organized criminal groups ;
(c) For the purposes of sub-paragraph (b), predicate offences shall include offences
committed both within and outside the jurisdiction of the State Party in question. However,
offences committed outside the jurisdiction of a State Party shall constitute predicate offences
only when the relevant conduct is a criminal offence under the domestic law of the State where
it is committed and would be a criminal
offence under the domestic law of the State Party implementing or applying this article had it
been committed there ;
(d) Each State Party shall furnish copies of its laws that give effect to this article and of any
subsequent changes to such laws or a description thereof to the Secretary-General of the United
Nations ;
(e) If required by fundamental principles of the domestic law of a State Party, it may be
provided that the offences set forth in paragraph 1 of this article do not apply to the persons who
committed the predicate offence
(f) Knowledge, intent or purpose required as an element of an offence set forth in paragraph 1
of this article may be inferred from objective factual circumstances." (emphasis supplied)
Thus, it is clear from a bare reading of two very initial international conventions attempting to
establish a world order to curb money-laundering, gave a very wide interpretation to the concept
of money-laundering. There has been a consensus that acquisition, possession, use, concealing
or disguising the illicit origin of illegitimately obtained money to evade legal consequences would
be money-laundering. Further, concealing and disguising too were clearly a part of money-
laundering and as such there was no bar or understating that pointed to the fact that there was
a
need to project the monies as untainted. This was obviously subject to the fundamental
principles of the domestic law of the countries. However, the growth of the jurisprudence in this
law did not stop or end there. As we progressed into a world equipped with the internet and into
a digital age, criminals found new ways to launder and the law found new ways to tackle them.
In the meanwhile, the FATF was established and it started working towards a goal of preventing
money-laundering. It has since its inception been aimed towards reducing cross border and intra
-State money-laundering activities. In this endeavour, it has made many concerted efforts to
study, understand, develop and mutually evaluate the state of the compliance in countries
towards reducing money-laundering. Today, as we will see, many of the amendments in the
2002 Act are in response to the recommendations of the FATF. Thereafter, forty
recommendations dated June 20, 2003, were made by the FATF which had led to much
deliberations go on to show that all endeavours were to be Vienna and Palermo Conventions
compliant. During the evolution of the jurisprudence on money-laundering, it was found that
India was in fact lacking in some aspects of curbing money-laundering. Hence, the
recommendations were made to
India time and again. It is pertinent also to reproduce the Mutual Evaluation of the Anti-
Money Laundering (AML) and Combating the Financing of Terrorism (CFT) regime of India as
adopted on June 24, 2010 in its recommendations, as it has been shown that it is based on
these observations that the amendment have been made, herein it has been observed thus :
"Recommendation 1.
Consistency with the United Nations Conventions
137. The Vienna and Palermo Conventions require countries to establish a criminal offence for
the following knowing/intentional acts : conversion or transfer of proceeds for specific purposes ;
concealment or disguise of the true nature, source, location, disposition, movement or ownership
of or rights with respect to proceeds ; and-subject to the fundamental/constitutional principles
or basic concepts of the country's legal system-the sole acquisition, possession or use of
proceeds (article 3(1)(b and (c) of the Vienna Convention ; and article 6(1) of the Palermo
Convention against Transnational Organised Crime-the TOC Convention).
138. Section 8A of the NDPS Act offence is an almost faithful transposition of the Vienna
Convention ML provisions. The PMLA takes a different approach by using a terminology that by
its broad wording is intended to generally correspond with the criminal activity targeted by both
the Vienna and Palermo Conventions.
139. As said, the PMLA (section 3) provides that money-laundering is committed where
someone 'directly or indirectly attempts to indulge, knowingly assists or knowingly is a party or
is actually involved in any process or activity connected with the proceeds of crime and
projecting it as untainted property'. The section 3 mens rea threshold is lower than the article
6.1(a) of the TOC Convention in that no specific purpose or intention is required. The substantive
element of 'projecting it as untainted property" carries the notion of knowing disguise, as
required by the Conventions, but does not appear to cover all concealment activity, such as the
physical hiding of the assets.
Recommendation 2
Scope of liability.
Implementation and effectiveness
164. When the PMLA was enacted on July 1, 2005 implementing the Palermo TOC Convention,
it was already clear that the scope of
the law was too restrictive to withstand the test of the relevant international standards. With
the extension of the list of predicate offences under Schedules A and B, and the addition of
Schedule C offences since June 1, 2009 India has made a serious effort to bring the ML
criminalisation of the PMLA in line with the FATF criteria in this respect. It did not do away with
all shortcomings, however.
165. Firstly, it is not clear why the legislator abandoned the NDPS Act approach to define the
ML activity by simply incorporating the relevant Convention language in the domestic law. With
section 3 of the PMLA money-laundering provision, a newly defined ML offence was introduced
differing from the comprehensive qualification of section 8A of the NDPS Act that was not
repealed, resulting in the coexistence of two divergent drug related ML offences.
166. The new definition of the ML offence in section 3 of the PMLA tries to capture all requisite
mental and physical elements of the Convention's ML provision in one overarching sentence. The
mens rea element is the 'knowledge' standard as minimally required by the Conventions. Section
3 of the PMLA does not require a specific intention or purpose, and as such its threshold is lower
than that of article 6.1(a)(i) of the TOC Convention. The provision however falls short on the
following actus reus aspects
(a) The physical element in all cases includes the substantive condition of 'projecting (the
proceeds of crime) as untainted property', so although the broad formulation of 'any process
or activity" covers any conduct involving criminal proceeds, such conduct is only criminalised
as money-laundering when the property is concurrently projected as untainted. While this
'projection' circumstance may correspond with the notion of 'disguise" as in article (a) (ii)
of the TOC Convention, it does not cover acts of physical concealment without any
'projecting' (such as deposit in a safe), even if-as was argued-this act is seen as an attempt
to 'project', quod non.
(b) With the imposition of the 'projecting' condition the PMLA offence does not extend to
the activity of sole 'acquisition, possession or use' of criminal proceeds as stated in article 6
(1)(b)(i) of the TOC Convention, although this would not be contrary to the basic concepts of
the Indian legal system. Only the offences of 'holding drug proceeds (NDPS Act section 68C)
or 'proceeds of terrorism" (UAPA section 21) are unconditional and may be considered to cover
"possession" situations in these specific circumstances. Also, the sections 410 and 411 IPC
"receiving" offence may cover acts of 'acquisition', but these
provisions fall short in respect of the scope of predicate offences, as they only apply to
stolen (or equivalent*) property.

some important and often long-standing legal issues to be
resolved. To that end following measures should be taken
:
The monetary threshold limitation of INR 3 millions for
the Schedule Part B predicate offences should be abolished.
The section 3 PMLA definition of the ML offence should be
brought in line with the Vienna and Palermo Conventions so
as to also fully cover the physical concealment and the sole
acquisition, possession and use of all relevant proceeds of
crime.
The present strict and formalistic interpretation of the
evidentiary requirements in respect of the proof of the
predicate offence should be put to the test of the courts to
develop case law and receive direction on this fundamental
legal issue.
The level of the maximum fine imposable on legal
persons should be raised or left at the discretion of the court
to ensure a more dissuasive effect.
The practice of making a conviction of legal persons
contingent on the concurrent prosecution/conviction of
a
(responsible) natural person should be abandoned."
(emphasis supplied)
Thus, it is clear that certain recommendations were made by the FATF concerning the
definition of money-laundering. It is also clear from public records that India has time and
again, since the inception of the Act, made active efforts to follow and evolve its own laws in line
with the mandates and recommendations of the FATF. Furthermore, it is noteworthy that
*
"Stolen" property includes property derived from extortion, robbery, misappropriation or breach of
trust (IPC section 410).
even in other jurisdictions ; the abovementioned definition has gained a more holistic
approach which is not per se the same as the colloquial term, "money launder" or simply turning
black money into white. In the UK and Spain, possession of criminal proceeds is covered under
the money-laundering, similarly by way of interpretation, the same is the case in Germany and
Italy*. Following these recommendations, amendments were brought about in India. This in turn
led to debates as can be seen from the following speeches which were made in Parliament. We
first note the speech of the then Finance Minister made on December 2, 1999 in the Lok Sabha
at the time of introducing the 1999 Bill, it is as follows :
"
The Foreign Exchange Regulation Act, 1973 primarily made compensatory transactions
(known as Havala) illegal. The basic aim was to ensure that no one contravenes the exchange
control regulations through unofficial channels. The emphasis was, therefore, on violation of
foreign exchange regulations rather than on 'money- laundering'. Money-laundering, that is the
cleansing of proceeds of crimes such as extortion, treason, drug trafficking, gun running, etc.,
poses a serious threat to the integrity and sovereignty of a country and also to its financial
systems. This threat to the nation and its economy has been recognised the world over and
several UN and other international conventions have called upon member countries to take
legislative and other preventive measures to combat the menace of money-laundering. As India
is a signatory to some of these conventions, a committee was set up to examine and suggest a
draft legislation for this purpose. Based on their report, a separate legislation has been
introduced with stringent penal provisions. At the same time, there is a need to consolidate and
amend the law relating to foreign exchange consistent with the liberalisation policies pursued
during the last eight years. While the provisions of Foreign Exchange Management Bill make
foreign exchange contraventions civil wrongs, the offences under the prevention of Money-
Laundering Bill have been made criminal and will attract stringent punishment.
The point I am making is that we have picked up certain offences which are heinous, as I said
in the beginning, which are of very serious nature. We are bringing this legislation on money-
laundering so that receipts from those crimes and properties acquired as a result thereof, are
dealt with under this Act. At the present moment, we have no
*

Maillart, Max Planck Institute, 2020 ed. page 798.
The surest way t legal research!"
legislation which will deal exclusively with this particular subject. So, we are bringing this
Bill." (emphasis supplied)
This speech, thus, set the tone for the years to come in our fight against money-laundering.
This law was enacted in 2002 yet brought into force in 2005. Later, a speech was made by the
then Finance Minister, who had introduced the Prevention of Money-Laundering (Amendment)
Bill, 2012 in the Rajya Sabha on December 17, 2012 :
"Shri P. Chidambaram : Mr. Deputy Chairman, Sir, I am grateful to the hon'ble Members,
especially ten hon'ble Members who have spoken on this Bill and supported the Bill. Naturally,
some questions will arise ; they have arisen. It is my duty to clarify those matters. Sir, firstly,
we must remember that the money-laundering is a very technically-defined offence. It is not the
way we understand 'money-laundering' in a colloquial sense. It is a technically-defined offence.
It postulates that there must be a predicate offence and it is dealing with the proceeds of a
crime. That is the offence of money-laundering. It is more than simply converting black-money
into white or white money into black. That is an offence under the Income-tax Act. There must
be a crime as defined in the Schedule. As a result of that crime, there must be certain proceeds.
It could be cash ; it could be property. And anyone who directly or indirectly indulges or assists
or is involved in any process or activity connected with the proceeds of crime and projects it as
untainted property is guilty of offence of money-laundering. So, it is a very technical offence.
The predicate offences are all listed in the Schedule. Unless there is a predicate offence, there
cannot be an offence of money-laundering. Initially the thinking was unless a person was
convicted of the predicate offence, you cannot convict him of money-laundering. But that
thinking is evolved now. The Financial Action Task Force has now come around to the view that if
the predicate offence has thrown up certain proceeds and you dealt with those proceeds, you
could be found guilty of offence of money-laundering. What we are trying to do is to bring this
law on lines of laws that are commended by FATF and all countries have obliged to bring their
laws on the same lines. I just want to point to some of my friends that this Bill was passed in
2002. In 2002, we felt that these provisions are sufficient. In the working of the law, we found
that the provisions have certain problems. We amended it in 2005. We amended it in 2009. We
still find that there are some problems. The FATF has pointed out some problems. And, we are
amending it in 2012. It is not
finding fault with anyone. All I am trying to say is that this is an evolutionary process. Laws
will evolve in this way, and we are amending it again in 2012." (emphasis supplied)
36. It is seen that there is clear inclination to follow the recommendations of the FATF, made
from time to time. Yet, before we move forward, we must note other statements that were made
before
the
latest
amendment
was
made.
In
the
Statement
RE
Amendment/Background/Justification for amendments to the 2002 Act-pages 226 to 235 of the
debate on the Finance Bill, 2019 it was noted that
"4. It has been experienced that certain doubts are also raised as regards definition of
'offence of money-laundering' included in section 3 of the Act of 2002. It is observed that the
legislative intent and object of the Act of 2002 is wrongly construed as if all the activities as
mentioned therein are required to be present together to constitute the offence of money-
laundering. The intention of the Legislature had always been that a person shall be held to be
guilty of offence of money-laundering if he is found to have directly or indirectly attempted to
indulge or knowingly assisted or knowingly is a party or is actually involved in any one or more
of the process of activity included in section 3 of the Act of 2002. It is also observed that the
original intention of the Legislature is wrongly construed to interpret as if the offence of money-
laundering is a one time instantaneous offence and finishes with its concealment or possession
or acquisition or use of projecting it as untainted property or claiming it as untainted property.
The intention of the Legislature had always been that a person will be held to be guilty of offence
of money-laundering and will be punished as long as person is enjoying the 'proceeds of crime'
by its concealment or possession or acquisition or use or projecting it as untainted property or
claiming it as untainted property or in any manner whatsoever. Accordingly, an Explanation is
proposed to be inserted in section 3 of the Act of 2002 to clarify the above legislative
intent." (emphasis supplied)
Thereafter, the following statement was made on two different occasions* :
"Shrimati Nirmala Sitharaman : The other amendments are into the PMLA, the Act relating to
black money. On that, I would like to assure the Members regarding the kind of amendments. In
fact, I
*
Seventeenth Series, Volume III, First Session, 2019/1941 (Saka) No. 24, Thursday, July 18,
2019/Ashadha 27, 1941 (Saka).
would like to mention, well before that, the number of amendments, which are coming
through for the PMLA, which is of 2002 vintage. Eight are being proposed by us. Of the eight, six
are only explanations to the existing clause. The clause itself is not being changed. We are only
coming with explanations. These explanations are being brought into the Act because of
pleading in the courts by some of those who are accused and because of some kind of a
confusion or a grey area or an ambiguity which might exist. Therefore, the amendment is not
amendment of the clause itself. It is more explaining the clause.
Shrimati Nirmala Sitharaman : More important is the amendment to the PMLA ; the
Prevention of Money-Laundering Act. There are, one or two, a couple of amendments which are
being made to the PMLA, which I just want to elaborate a bit so that the hon'ble Members know
what is that we are doing to the PMLA. They are all explanatory changes that we are bringing in.
Of the eight different changes that we are bringing into the PMLA, six relate to explanatory notes
because we find that in the courts, many of those offenders under the PMLA-if there are two
cases happening-try to club both the cases although they may be materially different and seek
of a bail. Therefore, what happens is, a case which has a different procedural matter is also
clubbed together with the case which is not procedural and at the end of the day, the law does
not get invoked in its true letter and spirit. So, such changes in the definition and explanatory
matters have been done in the PMLA. One little proviso which was not really relevant has been
removed and another which is being brought in again is more to make it clearer so that PMLA,
when invoked, becomes far more effective. So, these are the points on the PMLA- related
matters. (emphasis supplied)
It is seen that even though there were multiple arguments in respect of the definition of
section 34**, yet we chose to implement the said definition in a particular way. Later it was
realised by the Government and Parliament that with the passage of time and the development
of anti-money laundering jurisprudence world over, certain changes were to be made in the
definition of money-laundering. We do not find it prudent or necessary to run into arguments of
application of international law, as it is clear that the intentions of the successive Governments
have been the same since

day one of signing the international Conventions. It is only in light of this perception and
understanding of the legislation that we have been implementing the recommendations of the
FATF. However, we note that there has been a constant flow of thought from the FATF
recommendations, directly into our polity, which has pushed the money-laundering legislation
forward. Thus, there can be no doubt as to the bona fides of the Legislature in implementing an
understating of section 3 that will help not only stop but prevent money-laundering by nipping it
in the bud.
Section 3 of the 2002 Act
37. Coming to section 3 of the 2002 Act, the same defines the offence of money-laundering. The
expression "money-laundering", ordinarily, means the process or activity of placement, layering
and finally integrating the tainted property in the formal economy of the country. However, section
3 has a wider reach. The offence, as defined, captures every process and activity in dealing with the
proceeds of crime, directly or indirectly, and not limited to the happening of the final act of
integration of tainted property in the formal economy to constitute an act of money-laundering.
This is amply clear from the original provision, which has been further clarified by insertion of
Explanation vide Finance (No. 2) Act, 2019. Section 3, as amended, reads thus :
"3. Offence of money-laundering.-Whosoever directly or indirectly attempts to indulge or
knowingly assists or knowingly is a party or is actually involved in any process or activity
connected with the *[proceeds of crime including its concealment, possession, acquisition or use

continues till such time a person is directly or indirectly enjoying the proceeds of crime by its
concealment or possession or acquisition or use or projecting it as untainted property or
claiming it as untainted property in any manner whatsoever."
This section was first amended vide Act 2 of 2013. The expression "proceeds of crime and
projecting" was substituted by expression "proceeds of crime including its concealment,
possession, acquisition or use and projecting or claiming". We are not so much concerned
with this change introduced vide Act 2 of 2013. In other words, the provision as it stood prior
to amendment vide Finance (No. 2) Act, 2019 remained as it is. Upon breaking-up of this
provision, it would clearly indicate that-it is an offence of money-laundering, in the event of
direct or indirect attempt to indulge or knowingly assist or being knowingly party or being
actually involved in "any process or activity" connected with the proceeds of crime. The latter
part of the provision is only an elaboration of the different process or activity connected with
the proceeds of crime, such as its concealment, possession, acquisition, use, or projecting it
as untainted property or claiming it to be as untainted property. This position stands clarified
by way of Explanation inserted in 2019. If the argument of the petitioners is to be accepted,
that projecting or claiming the property as untainted property is the quintessential ingredient
of the offence of money-laundering, that would whittle down the sweep of section 3. Whereas,
the expression "including" is a pointer to the preceding part of the section which refers to the
essential ingredient of "process or activity" connected with the proceeds of crime. The
Explanation inserted by way of amendment of 2019, therefore, has clarified the word "and"
preceding the expression "projecting or claiming" as "or". That being only clarificatory,
whether introduced by way of Finance Bill or otherwise, would make no difference to the main
original provision as it existed prior to 2019 amendment. Indeed, there has been some debate
in Parliament about the need to retain the clause of projecting or claiming the property as
untainted property. However, the Explanation inserted by way of amendment of 2019 was
only to restate the stand taken by India in the proceedings before the FATF, as recorded in its
8th Follow-Up Report Mutual Evaluation of India June 2013 under heading "Core
Recommendations". This stand had to be taken by India
notwithstanding the amendment of 2013 vide Act 2 of 2013 (with effect from February 15,
2013) and Explanation offered by the then Minister of Finance during his address in
Parliament on December 17, 2012 as noted above*. Suffice it to note that the municipal
law
(Act of 2002) had been amended from time to time to incorporate the concerns and
recommendations noted by the international body. We may usefully refer to the Core
Recommendations of the FATF concerning India of June 2013, which reads thus :

(emphasis supplied)
38. To put it differently, the section as it stood prior to 2019 had itself incorporated the
expression "including", which is indicative of reference made to the different process or activity
connected with the proceeds of crime. Thus, the principal provision (as also the Explanation)
predicates that if a person is found to be directly or indirectly involved in any process or activity
connected with the proceeds of crime must be held guilty of offence of money-laundering. If the
interpretation set forth by the petitioners was to be accepted, it would follow that it is only upon
projecting or claiming the property in question as untainted property, the offence would be
complete. This would undermine the efficacy of the legislative intent behind section 3 of the Act
and also will be in disregard of the view expressed by the FATF in connection with the occurrence of
the word "and" preceding the expres
sion "projecting or claiming" therein. This court in Pratap Singh V. State of Jharkhand*, enunciated
that the international treaties, covenants and conventions although may not be a part of municipal
law, the same be referred to and followed by the courts having regard to the fact that India is a
party to the said treaties. This court went on to observe that the Constitution of India and other
ongoing statutes have been read consistently with the rules of international law. It is also observed
that the Constitution of India and the enactments made by Parliament must necessarily be
understood in the context of the present-day scenario and having regard to the international
treaties and convention as our constitution takes note of the institutions of the world community
which had been created. In Apparel Export Promotion Council V. A. K. Chopra** the court observed
that domestic courts are under an obligation to give due regard to the international conventions
and norms for construing the domestic laws, more so, when there is no inconsistency between
them and there is a void in domestic law. This view has been restated in Ms. Githa Hariharan
(supra), as also in People's Union for Civil Liberties (supra) and National Legal Services Authority V.
Union of India*
39. In the Core Recommendations of the FATF referred to above, the same clearly mention that
the word "and" in section 3 of the 2002 Act would not be fully in line with the Vienna and Palermo
Conventions. This doubt has been ably responded and elucidated by India to the international body
by referring to the jurisprudence as evolved in India to interpret the word "and" as "or" in the
context of the legislative intent-to reckon any (every) process or activity connected with the
proceeds of crime constituting offence of money-laundering. To buttress the stand taken by India
before the FATF, reliance has been justly placed on reported decisions of this court amongst other
Sanjay Dutt (supra), which had occasion to deal with the expression "arms and ammunition"
occurring in section 5 of the TADA Act. The court noted that if it is to be read conjunctively because
of word "and", the object of prohibiting unauthorised possession of the forbidden arms and
ammunition would be easily frustrated by the simple device of one person carrying the forbidden
arms and his accomplice carrying its ammunition so that neither is covered under section 5 when
any one of them carrying more would be so liable. The principle underlying this analysis by the
Constitution Bench must apply proprio vigore to the interpretation of section 3 of the 2002 Act. To
the same end, this court in the case
of Ishwar Singh Bindra V. State of U. Joint Director of Mines Safety (supra) and Gujarat Urja
Vikas Nigam Ltd. V. Essar Power Ltd.**, interpreted the word "and" in the concerned legislation(s)
as word "or" to give full effect to the legislative intent.
40. The Explanation as inserted in 2019, therefore, does not entail in expanding the purport of
section 3 as it stood prior to 2019, but is only clarificatory in nature. Inasmuch as section 3 is
widely worded with a view to not only investigate the offence of money-laundering but also to
prevent and regulate that offence. This provision plainly indicates that any (every) process or
activity connected with the proceeds of crime results in offence of money-laundering. Projecting or
claiming the proceeds of crime as untainted property, in itself, is an attempt to indulge in or being
involved in money-laundering, just as knowingly concealing, possessing, acquiring or using of
proceeds of crime, directly or indirectly. This is reinforced by the statement presented along with
the Finance Bill, 2019 before Parliament on July 18, 2019 as noted above*
41. Independent of the above, we have no hesitation in construing the expression "and" in
section 3 as "or", to give full play to the said provision so as to include "every" process or activity
indulged into by anyone, including projecting or claiming the property as untainted property to
constitute an offence of money-laundering on its own. The act of projecting or claiming proceeds of
crime to be untainted property presupposes that the person is in possession of or is using the same
(proceeds of crime), also an independent activity constituting offence of money-laundering. In
other words, it is not open to read the different activities conjunctively because of the word "and".
If that interpretation is accepted, the effectiveness of section 3 of the 2002 Act can be easily
frustrated by the simple device of one person possessing proceeds of crime and his accomplice
would indulge in projecting or claiming it to be untainted property so that neither is covered under
section 3 of the 2002 Act.
42. From the bare language of section 3 of the 2002 Act, it is amply clear that the offence of
money-laundering is an independent offence regarding the process or activity connected with the
proceeds of crime which had been derived or obtained as a result of criminal activity relating to or
in relation to a scheduled offence. The process or activity can be in any form-be it one of
concealment, possession, acquisition, use of proceeds of crime as much as projecting it as
untainted property or claiming it to be so.
* (1969) 1 SCR 219.
See paragraph 36 of this judgment.
Thus, involvement in any one of such process or activity connected with the proceeds of crime
would constitute offence of money-laundering. This offence otherwise has nothing to do with the
criminal activity relating to a scheduled offence-except the proceeds of crime derived or obtained
as a result of that crime.
43. Needless to mention that such process or activity can be indulged in only after the property
is derived or obtained as a result of criminal activity (a scheduled offence). It would be an offence
of money-laundering to indulge in or to assist or being party to the process or activity connected
with the proceeds of crime ; and such process or activity in a given fact situation may be a
continuing offence, irrespective of the date and time of commission of the scheduled offence. In
other words, the criminal activity may have been committed before the same had been notified as
scheduled offence for the purpose of the 2002 Act, but if a person has indulged in or continues to
indulge directly or indirectly in dealing with proceeds of crime, derived or obtained from such
criminal activity even after it has been notified as scheduled offence, may be liable to be
prosecuted for offence of money-laundering under the 2002 Act-for continuing to possess or
conceal the proceeds of crime (fully or in part) or retaining possession thereof or uses it in trenches
until fully exhausted. The offence of money-laundering is not dependent on or linked to the date on
which the scheduled offence or if we may say so the predicate offence has been committed. The
relevant date is the date on which the person indulges in the process or activity connected with
such proceeds of crime. These ingredients are intrinsic in the original provision (section 3, as
amended until 2013 and were in force till July 31, 2019) ; and the same has been merely explained
and clarified by way of Explanation vide the Finance (No. 2) Act, 2019. Thus understood, inclusion
of clause (ii) in Explanation inserted in 2019 is of no consequence as it does not alter or enlarge the
scope of section 3 at all.
44. As mentioned earlier, the rudimentary understanding of "money-laundering" is that there
are three generally accepted stages to money-laundering, they are :
(a) Placement : which is to move the funds from direct association of the crime.
(b) Layering : which is disguising the trail to foil pursuit.
(c) Integration : which is making the money available to the criminal from what seem to be
legitimate sources.
45. It is common experience world over that money-laundering can be a threat to the good
functioning of a financial system. However, it is also the most suitable mode for the criminals to
deal in such money. It is the means of livelihood of drug dealers, terrorist, white collar criminals
and so on. Tainted money breeds discontent in any society and in turn leads to more crime and civil
unrest. Thus, the onus on the Government and the people to identify and seize such money is
heavy. If there are any proactive steps towards such a cause, we cannot but facilitate the good
steps. However, passions aside we must first balance the law to be able to save the basic tenets of
the fundamental rights and laws of this country. After all, condemning an innocent man is a bigger
misfortune than letting a criminal go.
46. On a bare reading of section 3, we find no difficulty in encapsulating the true ambit, given
the various arguments advanced. Thus, in the conspectus of things it must follow that the
interpretation put forth by the respondent will further the purposes and objectives behind the 2002
Act and also adequately address the recommendations and doubts of the international body whilst
keeping in mind the constitutional limits. It would, therefore, be just to sustain the argument that
the amendment by way of the Explanation has been brought about only to clarify the already
present words, "any" and "including" which manifests the true meaning of the definition and
clarifies the mist around its true nature.
47. We may profitably advert to the judgment in Seaford Court Estates Ltd. (supra), which
states :
"The question for decision in this case is whether we are at liberty to extend the ordinary
meaning of 'burden' so as to include a contingent burden of the kind I have described. Now this
court has already held that this sub-section is to be liberally construed so as to give effect to the
governing principles embodied in the legislation (Winchester Court Ltd. V. Miller*) ; and I think
we should do the same. Whenever a statute comes up for consideration it must be remembered
that it is not within human powers to foresee the manifold sets of facts which may arise, and,
even if it were, it is not possible to provide for them in terms free from all ambiguity. The
English language is not an instrument of mathematical precision. Our literature would be much
the poorer if it were. This is where the draftsmen of Acts of Parliament have often been unfairly
criticized. A judge, believing himself to be fettered by the supposed rule that he must look to the
language and nothing else, laments that the draftsmen have not provided for this or that, or
have been guilty of some or other ambiguity. It would certainly save the judges trouble if Acts of
Parliament were drafted with divine prescience and perfect clarity. In the absence of it,
* [1944] KB 734.
when a defect appears a judge cannot simply fold his hands and blame the draftsman. He
must set to work on the constructive task of finding the intention of Parliament, and he must do
this not only from the language of the statute, but also from a consideration of the social
conditions which gave rise to it, and of the mischief which it was passed to remedy, and then he
must supplement the written word so as to give 'force and life" to the intention of the
Legislature. That was clearly laid down by the resolution of the judges in Heydon's case*, and it
is the safest guide today. Good practical advice on the subject was given about the same time
by Plowden in his second volume Eyston V. Studd**. Put into homely metaphor it is this : A
judge should ask himself the question : If the makers of the Act had themselves come across
this ruck in the texture of it, how would they have straightened it out ? He must then do as they
would have done. A judge must not alter the material of which it is woven, but he can and
should iron out the creases." (emphasis supplied)
48. Let us now also refer to the various cases that have been pressed into service by the
petitioners. The same deal with the proposition as to the scope of an Explanation and the limits up
to which it can stretch. Yet given the present scenario, we cannot find a strong footing to rely on
the same in understating section 3 of the 2002 Act as it stands today. Reference has been made to
K. P. Varghese (supra) wherein the court noted the Heydon's case (supra) and to the fact that the
speech of the mover of the bill can explain the reason for introduction of the bill and help ascertain
the mischief sought to be remedied, the objects and purposes of the legislation. Similarly,
reference has been made to Hardev Motor Transport V. State of M. P. and Martin Lottery
Agencies Ltd. (supra), which states that the role of an Explanation in the Schedule of the Act
cannot defeat the main provision of the Act. Even otherwise, an Explanation cannot enlarge the
scope and effect of a provision. Reference is also made to S. Sundaram Pillai V. V. R.
Pattabiraman#, which reads thus :
"50. In Bihta Co-operative Development and Cane Marketing Union Ltd. V. Bank of Bihar
Ltd.# this court observed thus
* (1584) 3 Co. Rep. 7a.
(1574) 2 Plowden 465.
# # (1967) 37 Comp Cas 98 (SC) ; (1967) 1 SCR 848 ; AIR 1967 SC 389.
The Explanation must be read so as to harmonise with and clear up any ambiguity in the
main section. It should not be so construed as to widen the ambit of the section
53. Thus, from a conspectus of the authorities referred to above, it is manifest that the object
of an Explanation to a statutory provision is-
(a) to explain the meaning and intendment of the Act itself,
(b) where there is any obscurity or vagueness in the main enactment, to clarify the same
so as to make it consistent with the dominant object which it seems to subserve,
(c) to provide an additional support to the dominant object of the Act in order to make it
meaningful and purposeful,
(d) an Explanation cannot in any way interfere with or change the enactment or any part
thereof but where some gap is left which is relevant for the purpose of the Explanation, in
order to suppress the mischief and advance the object of the Act it can help or assist the
court in interpreting the true purport and intendment of the enactment, and
(e) it cannot, however, take away a statutory right with which any person under a statute
has been clothed or set at naught the working of an Act by becoming an hindrance in the
interpretation of the same." (emphasis supplied)
However, in the present case we find that the Explanation only sets forth in motion to clear
the mist around the main definition, if any. It is not to widen the ambit of section 3 of the
2002 Act as such. Further, the meaning ascribed to the expression "and" to be read as "or" is
in consonance with the contemporary thinking of the international community and in
consonance with the Vienna and Palermo Conventions.
49. Reference has also been made to judgments which refer to the purport of side notes in the
interpretation of a statute in Thakurain Balraj Kunwar V. Rae Jagatpal Singh*, Nalinakhya Bysack V.
Shyam Sunder Haldar**, Chandroji Rao V. CIT***, Board of Muslim Wakfs V. Radha Kishan#, Tara
Prasad Singh V. Union of India## Sakshi V. Union of India### Guntaiah V.
AIR 1953 SC 148.
Hambamma* and C. Gupta V. Glaxo-Smithkline Pharmaceuticals Ltd. However, we find them of
no use in the present case as we have already held that the Explanation only goes on to clarify the
main or original provision. Other cases, which are of no help to the present issue, are the cases of
D. R. Fraser and Co. Ltd. V. Minister of National Revenue** Tofan Singh (supra) and Ashok
Munilal Jain (supra). Reference has also been made to Nikesh Tarachand Shah (supra). However,
there the questions raised were not in respect of the meaning of money-laundering and pertinently
the amendment has come post the judgment, hence, will have no real bearing, unless it can be
shown that the amendment is in some other way contrary to the Indian law.
50. We also cannot countenance the argument made in light of possible harassment of innocent
persons. It is noted that to the 1999 Bill, the Select Committee of the Rajya Sabha had pointed out
that if even mere possession of money/property out of proceeds of crime were to be punishable
then :
"The Committee finds that sub-clauses (a) and (c) viewed .in the context of the provisions
contained in clause 23 of the Bill may lead to harassment of innocent persons who bona fide and
unknowingly deal with the persons who have committed the offence of money-laundering and
enter into transactions with them. Such persons purchasing property born out of proceeds of
crime without having any inkling whatsoever about that are liable to be prosecuted if the sub-
clauses (a) and (c) remain in the Bill in the existing form.
The fact of the matter is that these sub-clauses do not provide any protection or defence to
this category of persons." (emphasis supplied)
Accordingly, the phrase "and projecting it as untainted property" was added the initial
definition in the 2002 Act. However, it can also be inferred from here that since the initial
strokes of drafting the Act, the intention was always to have a preventive Act and not simply a
money-laundering (penal) Act. Today, if one dives deep into the financial systems, anywhere in
the world, it is seen that once a financial mastermind can integrate the illegitimate money into
the bloodstream of an economy, it is almost indistinguishable. In fact, the money can be simply
wired abroad at one click of the mouse. It is also well known that once this money leaves the
country, it
is almost impossible to get it back. Hence, a simplistic argument or the view that section 3
should only find force once the money has been laundered, does not commend to us. That has
never been the intention of Parliament nor the international Conventions.
51. We may also note that argument that removing the necessity of projection from the
definition will render the predicate offence and money- laundering indistinguishable. This, in our
view, is ill founded and fallacious. This plea cannot hold water for the simple reason that the
scheduled offences in the 2002 Act as it stands (amended up to date) are independent criminal
acts. It is only when money is generated as a result of such acts that the 2002 Act steps in as soon
as proceeds of crime are involved in any process or activity. Dealing with such proceeds of crime
can be in any form-being process or activity. Thus, even assisting in the process or activity is a
part of the crime of money-laundering. We must keep in mind that for being liable to suffer legal
consequences of ones action of indulging in the process or activity, is sufficient and not only upon
projection of the ill-gotten money as untainted money. Many members of a crime syndicate could
then simply keep the money with them for years to come, the hands of the law in such a situation
cannot be bound and stopped from proceeding against such person, if information of such
The surest way t legal research!"
illegitimate monies is revealed even from an unknown source.
52. The next question is : whether the offence under section 3 is a standalone offence ? Indeed,
it is dependent on the wrongful and illegal gain of property as a result of criminal activity relating
to a scheduled offence. Nevertheless, it is concerning the process or activity connected with such
property, which constitutes offence of money-laundering. The property must qualify the definition
of "proceeds of crime" under section 2(1)(u) of the 2002 Act. As observed earlier, all or whole of
the crime property linked to scheduled offence need not be regarded as proceeds of crime, but all
properties qualifying the definition of "proceeds of crime" under section 2(1)(u) will necessarily be
crime properties. Indeed, in the event of acquittal of the person concerned or being absolved from
allegation of criminal activity relating to scheduled offence, and if it is established in the court of
law that the crime property in the concerned case has been rightfully owned and possessed by him,
such a property by no stretch of imagination can be termed as crime property and ex-consequenti
proceeds of crime within the meaning of section 2(1)(u) as it stands today. On the other hand, in
the trial in connection with the scheduled offence, the court would be obliged to direct return of
such property as belonging to him. It would be then paradoxical to still regard such property as
proceeds of crime despite such adjudication by a court of competent jurisdiction. It is well within
the jurisdiction of the concerned court trying the scheduled offence to pronounce on that matter.
53. Be it noted that the authority of the Authorised Officer under the 2002 Act to prosecute any
person for offence of money-laundering gets triggered only if there exists proceeds of crime within
the meaning of section 2(1)(u) of the 2002 Act and further it is involved in any process or activity.
Not even in a case of existence of undisclosed income and irrespective of its volume, the definition
of "proceeds of crime" under section 2(1)(u) will get attracted, unless the property has been
derived or obtained as a result of criminal activity relating to a scheduled offence. It is possible that
in a given case after the discovery of huge volume of undisclosed property, the authorised officer
may be advised to send information to the jurisdictional police (under section 66(2) of the 2002
Act) for registration of a scheduled offence contemporaneously, including for further investigation in
a pending case, if any. On receipt of such information, the jurisdictional police would be obliged to
register the case by way of FIR if it is a cognizable offence or as a non-cognizable offence (NC
case), as the case may be. If the offence so reported is a scheduled offence, only in that
eventuality, the property recovered by the authorised officer would partake the colour of proceeds
of crime under section 2(1)(u) of the 2002 Act, enabling him to take further action under the Act in
that regard.
54. Even though, the 2002 Act is a complete Code in itself, it is only in respect of matters
connected with offence of money-laundering, and for that, existence of proceeds of crime within the
meaning of section 2(1)(u) of the Act is quintessential. Absent existence of proceeds of crime, as
aforesaid, the authorities under the 2002 Act cannot step in or initiate any prosecution.
55. In other words, the Authority under the 2002 Act, is to prosecute a person for offence of
money-laundering only if it has reason to believe, which is required to be recorded in writing that
the person is in possession of "proceeds of crime". Only if that belief is further supported by
tangible and credible evidence indicative of involvement of the person concerned in any process or
activity connected with the proceeds of crime, action under the Act can be taken forward for
attachment and confiscation of proceeds of crime and until vesting thereof in the Central
Government, such process initiated would be a standalone process.
Section 5 of the 2002 Act
56. Section 5 forms part of Chapter III dealing with attachment, adjudication and confiscation.
This provision empowers the Director or officer not below the rank of Deputy Director authorised by
the Director for the purposes of attachment of property involved in money-laundering. Such
authorised officer is expected to act only if he has reason to believe that any person is in possession
of proceeds of crime. This belief has to be formed on the basis of material in his possession and the
reasons therefor are required to be recorded in writing. In addition, he must be convinced that such
proceeds of crime are likely to be concealed, transferred or dealt with in any manner which is likely
to result in frustrating any proceedings concerning confiscation thereof under the 2002 Act. Section
5 as amended reads thus :

(5) The Director or any other officer who provisionally attaches any property under sub-
section (1) shall, within a period of thirty days from such attachment, file a complaint stating

From the plain language of this provision, it is evident that several in- built safeguards have
been provided by Parliament while enacting the 2002 Act. This provision has been amended vide
Act 21 of 2009, Act 2 of 2013, Finance Act, 2015 and Act 13 of 2018, to strengthen the
mechanism keeping in mind the scheme of the 2002 Act and the need to prevent and regulate
the activity of money-laundering. As regards the amendments made vide Act 21 of 2009 and Act
2 of 2013, the same are not matters in issue in these cases. The challenge is essentially to the
amendment effected in the second proviso in sub-section (1), vide Finance Act, 2015.
57. Be that as it may, as aforesaid, sub-section (1) delineates sufficient safeguards to be
adhered to by the authorised officer before issuing provisional attachment order in respect of
proceeds of crime. It is only upon recording satisfaction regarding the twin requirements referred to
in sub-section (1), the authorised officer can proceed to issue order of provisional attachment of
such proceeds of crime. Before issuing a formal order, the authorised officer has to form his opinion
and delineate the reasons for such belief to be recorded in writing, which indeed is not on the basis
of assumption, but on the basis of material in his possession. The order of provisional attachment
is, thus, the outcome of such satisfaction already recorded by the authorised officer. Notably, the
provisional order of attachment operates for a fixed duration not exceeding one hundred and eighty
days from the date of the order. This is yet another safeguard provisioned in the 2002 Act itself.
58. As per the first proviso, in ordinary situation, no order of provisional attachment can be
issued until a report has been forwarded to a magistrate under section 173 of the 1973 Code in
relation to the scheduled offence, or a complaint has been filed by a person authorised to
investigate the offence mentioned in that Schedule, before a magistrate or court for taking
cognizance of the scheduled offence, as the case may be. It further provides that a similar report or
complaint has been made or filed under the corresponding law of any other country. In other
words, filing of police report or a private complaint in relation to the scheduled offence had been
made a precondition for issuing an order of provisional attachment.
59. The second proviso, as it existed prior to the Finance Act, 2015, had predicated that
notwithstanding anything contained in clause (b) of sub- section (1) any property of any person
may be attached in the same manner and satisfaction to be recorded that non-attachment of
property likely to frustrate any proceeding under the 2002 Act. By amendment vide the Finance
Act, 2015, the words "clause (b)" occurring in the second proviso came to be substituted to read
words "first proviso". This is the limited change, but an effective one to give full play to the
legislative intent regarding prevention and regulation of process or activity concerning proceeds of
crime entailing in offence of money-laundering. Prior to the amendment, the first proviso was
rightly perceived as an impediment. In that, to invoke the action of even provisional attachment
order, registration of scheduled offence and completion or substantial progress in investigation
thereof were made essential. This was notwithstanding the urgency involved in securing the
proceeds of crime for being eventually confiscated and vesting in the Central Government. Because
of the time lag and the advantage or opportunities available to the person concerned to manipulate
the proceeds of crime, the amendment of 2015 had been brought about to overcome the
impediment and empower the Director or any other officer not below the rank of Deputy Director
authorised by him to proceed to issue provisional attachment order. In terms of the second proviso,
the authorised officer has to record satisfaction and reason for his belief in writing on the basis of
material in his possession that the property (proceeds of crime) involved in money-laundering if not
attached "immediately", would frustrate proceedings under the 2002 Act. This is a further
safeguard provided in view of the urgency felt by the competent authority to secure the property to
effectively prevent and regulate the offence of money-laundering. In other words, the authorised
officer cannot resort to action of provisional attachment of property (proceeds of crime)
mechanically. Thus, there are in-built safeguards provided in the main provision as well as the
second proviso to be fulfilled up to the highest ranking ED official, before invoking such urgent or
"immediate" action. We fail to understand as to how such a provision can be said to be irrelevant
much less manifestly arbitrary, in the context of the purposes and objects behind the enactment of
the 2002 Act. Such provision would strengthen the mechanism of prevention and regulation of
process or activity resulting into commission of money-laundering offence and also, to ensure that
the proceeds of crime are properly dealt with as ordained by the 2002 Act, including for vesting in
the Central Government.
60. As a matter of fact, prior to amendment of 2015, the first proviso acted as an impediment
for taking such urgent measure even by the authorised officer, who is no less than the rank of
Deputy Director. We must hasten to add that the nuanced distinction must be kept in mind that to
initiate "prosecution" for offence under section 3 of the Act registration of scheduled offence is a
prerequisite, but for initiating action of "provisional attachment" under section 5 there need not be
a
pre-registered criminal case in connection with scheduled offence. This is because the machinery
provisions cannot be construed in a manner which would eventually frustrate the proceedings under
the 2002 Act. Such dispensation alone can secure the proceeds of crime including prevent and
regulate the commission of offence of money-laundering. The authorised officer would, thus, be
expected to and, also in a given case, justified in acting with utmost speed to ensure that the
proceeds of crime/property is available for being proceeded with appropriately under the 2002 Act
so as not to frustrate any proceedings envisaged by the 2002 Act. In case the scheduled offence is
not already registered by the jurisdictional police or complaint filed before the magistrate, it is open
to the authorised officer to still proceed under section 5 of the 2002 Act whilst contemporaneously
sending information to the jurisdictional police under section 66(2) of the 2002 Act for registering
FIR in respect of cognizable offence or report regarding non-cognizable offence and if the
jurisdictional police fails to respond appropriately to such information, the authorised officer under
the 2002 Act can take recourse to appropriate remedy, as may be permissible in law to ensure that
the culprits do not go unpunished and the proceeds of crime are secured and dealt with as per the
dispensation provided for in the 2002 Act. Suffice it to observe that the amendment effected in
2015 in the second proviso has reasonable nexus with the object sought to be achieved by the
2002 Act.
61. The third proviso in section 5(1) of the 2002 Act is another safeguard introduced vide Act 13
of 2018 about the manner in which period of one hundred and eighty days need to be reckoned
thereby providing for fixed tenure of the provisional attachment order. Before the expiry of the
statutory period relating to the provisional attachment order, the Director or any other officer not
below the rank of Deputy Director immediately after attachment under sub-section (1) is obliged to
forward a copy of the provisional attachment order to the three-member adjudicating authority
(appointed under section 6(1) of the 2002 Act, headed by, amongst other, person qualified for
appointment as District Judge), in a sealed envelope under section 5(2), which is required to be
retained by the adjudicating authority for the period as prescribed under the rules framed in that
regard. This ensures the fairness in the action as also accountability of the authority passing
provisional attachment order. Further, in terms of section 5(3), the provisional attachment order
ceases to operate on the date of an order passed by the adjudicating authority under section 8(3)
or the expiry of the period specified in sub-section (1), whichever is earlier. In addition, under
section 5(5) the authorised officer is obliged to file a complaint before the adjudicating authority
within a period of thirty days from such provisional attachment. Going by the scheme of the 2002
Act and section 5 thereof in particular, it is amply clear that sufficient safeguards have been
provided for as preconditions for invoking the powers of emergency attachment in the form of
provisional attachment.
62. The background in which the amendment of 2013 became necessary can be culled out from
the report titled "Anti-Money-Laundering and Combating the Financing of Terrorism" dated June 25,
2010. The relevant paragraphs of the said report read thus :
"143. It is no formal and express legal condition that a conviction for the predicate offence is
required as a precondition to prosecute money-laundering, although some practitioners the
assessment team met with felt that only a conviction would satisfactorily meet the evidentiary
requirements. The definition of property in the PMLA (see supra) however requires property to
be-related to a scheduled offence. Consequently, the section 3 ML offence not being an-all
crimes offence, in the absence of case law, it is generally interpreted as requiring at the very
minimum positive proof of the specific predicate offence before a conviction for money-
laundering can be obtained, be it for third party or self-laundering.
144. Similarly, under section 8A of the NDPS Act, although it is debatable that the person
charged with money-laundering needs to have been convicted of a predicate offence, the
positive and formal proof of a nexus with a drug related predicate offence is essential.
168. The linkage and interaction of the ML offence with a specific predicate criminality is
historically very tight in the Indian AML regime. The concept of stand-alone money-laundering is
quite strange to the practitioners, who cannot conceive pursuing money- laundering as a sui
generis autonomous offence. Some interlocutors were even of the (arguably erroneous) opinion
that only a conviction for the predicate criminality would effectively satisfy the evidential
requirements. As said, this attitude is largely due to the general
practice in India to start a ML investigation only on the basis of a predicate offence case. Even
if the ML investigation since recently can run concurrently with the predicate offence enquiry,
there is no inter- agency MOU or arrangement to deal with evidentiary issues between the
various agencies in investigating predicates and ML offences. Also, the way the interaction
between the law enforcement agencies is presently structured carries the risk that ML
prosecutions could be delayed while the other predicate offence investigation agencies try to
secure convictions.
175. Although recently an increased focus on the ML aspect and use of the ML provisions is to
be acknowledged, there are still some important and often long-standing legal issues to be
resolved. To that end following measures should be taken :
-The monetary threshold limitation of INR 3 millions for the Schedule Part B predicate
offences should be abolished.
-The section 3 PMLA definition of the ML offence should be brought in line with the vienna
and palermo conventions so as to also fully cover the physical concealment and the sole
acquisition, possession and use of all relevant proceeds of crime.
-The present strict and formalistic interpretation of the evidentiary requirements in
respect of the proof of the predicate offence should be put to the test of the courts to develop
case law and receive direction on this fundamental legal issue.
-The level of the maximum fine imposable on legal persons should be raised or left at the
discretion of the court to ensure a more dissuasive effect.
-The practice of making a conviction of legal persons contingent on the concurrent
prosecution/conviction of a (responsible) natural person should be abandoned.
-Consider the abolishment of the redundant section 8A NDPS Act drug-related ML offence
or, if maintained, bring the sanctions at a level comparable to that of the PMLA offence.
233. Confiscation under Chapter III of the PMLA is only possible when it relates to-proceeds
of crime as defined in section 2(1)(u), i. e., resulting from a scheduled offence, and when there
is a conviction of such scheduled (predicate) offence. In addition, in such cases, only proceeds of
the predicate offence can be confiscated and not the proceeds of the ML offence itself.
234. The predicate offence conviction condition creates fundamental difficulties when trying to
confiscate the proceeds of crime in the absence of a conviction of a predicate offence, particularly
in a stand- alone ML case, where the laundered assets become the corpus delicti and should be
forfeitable as such. In the international context, the predicate conviction requirement also
seriously affects the capacity to recover criminal assets where the predicate offence has occurred
outside India and the proceeds are subsequently laundered in India (see also comments in
section 2.1 above).
235. The definition of proceeds of crime and property in the PMLA are broad enough to allow
for confiscation of property derived directly or indirectly from proceeds of crime relating to a
scheduled (predicate) offence, including income, profits and other benefits from the proceeds of
crime. These definitions also allow for value confiscation, regardless of whether the property is
held or owned by a criminal or a third party. As section 65 of the PMLA refers to the rules in Cr.
P. C., instrumentalities and intended instrumentalities can be confiscated in accordance with
sections 102 and 451 of the Cr. P. C. However, there is no case law in this respect.
236. Also, the procedural provisions of Chapter III make confiscation of the proceeds of crime
contingent on a prior seizure of attachment of the property by the adjudicating authority, and
consequently substantially limit the possibilities for confiscation under the PMLA.
'General comments"
244. Since confiscation is linked to a conviction it is not possible to confiscate criminal
proceeds when the defendant has died during the criminal proceedings. However, it is possible
to attach and dispose of any property of a proclaimed offender when that person has absconded.
The absence of a regulation when the defendant has died may have a negative impact on the
effectiveness of the confiscation regime in place in India."
In view of the observations made in said Report, the FATF made recommendations as
follows :
"2.3.3 Compliance with Recommendations 3
Rating
Summary of factors relative to S. 2.3 underlying overall rating
R.3
PC
Confiscation of property laundered is not covered in the relevant -legislation

confiscated.
There are no clear provisions and procedures on how to deal with the assets in
the case of criminal proceedings when the suspect died.
Concerns based on the limited number of confiscations in relation to ML/FT
offences."
64. As a sequel to these recommendations of FATF and the observations in the stated report,
section 5 came to be amended vide Act 2 of 2013. In this connection, it may be useful to refer to
the Fifty Sixth Report of the Standing Committee on Finance relating to the 2011 Bill, which reads
thus :
"5. Amendment in provisions implemented by the Enforcement Directorate
(i) Attachment of property : The present Act in section 5 stipulates that the person from
whom property is attached must 'have been charged of having committed a scheduled
offence'. It is proposed to be deleted as property may come to rest with someone, who has
nothing to do with the scheduled offence or even the money-laundering offence. Procedure for
attachment is at present done as provided in the Second Schedule to the Income-tax Act,
1961. Now it is proposed in section 5(1) that the procedure will be prescribed separately.
Time for adjudicating authority to confirm attachment of property by ED has been proposed to
be increased from 150 days to 180 days.
(iii) Making confiscation independent of conviction : At present attachment of property
becomes final under section 8(3) 'after the guilt of the person is proved in the trial court and
order of such trial court becomes final'. Problems are faced in such cases where money-
laundering has been done by a person who has not committed the scheduled offence or where
property has come to rest with someone who has not committed any offence. Therefore, it is
proposed to amend section 8(5) to provide for attachment and confiscation of the proceeds of
crime, even if there is no conviction, so long as it is proved that predicate offence and money-
laundering offence have taken place and the property in question (i. e., the proceeds of crime)
is involved in money-laundering.
However, the MER 2010 highlighted certain deficiencies in the AML legislation which
adversely affected the ratings on a few FATF recommendations. The areas are broadly
summarized below :-
(a) Commodities market out of the ambit of PMLA.
(b) DNFBP sector not subjected to PMLA (except Casino).
(c) Effectiveness concerns due to absence of ML conviction.
(d) Identification and verification of beneficial ownership of legal persons.
(e) Ineffective sanctions regime for non-compliance. India has suggested an action plan
with short, medium and long-term objectives to address the specific issues raised in the
MER 2010 that includes proposed amendments in the PMLA." (emphasis supplied)
65. As aforesaid, in this backdrop the amendment Act 2 of 2013 came into being. Considering
the purport of the amended provisions and the experience of implementing/enforcement agencies,
further changes became necessary to strengthen the mechanism regarding prevention of money-
laundering. It is not right in assuming that the attachment of property (provisional) under the
second proviso, as amended, has no link with the scheduled offence. Inasmuch as section 5(1)
envisages that such an action can be initiated only on the basis of material in possession of the
authorised officer indicative of any person being in possession of proceeds of crime. The
precondition for being proceeds of crime is that the property has been derived or obtained, directly
or indirectly, by any person as a result of criminal activity relating to a scheduled offence. The
sweep of section 5(1) is not limited to the accused named in the criminal activity relating to a
scheduled offence. It would apply to any person (not necessarily being accused in the scheduled
offence), if he is involved in any process or activity connected with the proceeds of crime. Such a
person besides facing the consequence of provisional attachment order, may end up in being
named as accused in the complaint to be filed by the authorised officer concerning offence under
section 3 of the 2002 Act.
66. Be it noted that the attachment must be only in respect of property which appears to be
proceeds of crime and not all the properties belonging to concerned person who would eventually
face the action of confiscation of proceeds of crime, including prosecution for offence of money-
laundering. As mentioned earlier, the relevant date for initiating action under the 2002 Act-be it of
attachment and confiscation or prosecution, is linked to the inclusion of the offence as scheduled
offence and of carrying on the process or activity in connection with the proceeds of crime after
such date. The pivot moves around the date of carrying on the process and activity connected with
the proceeds of crime ; and not the date on which the property has been derived or obtained by the
person concerned as a result of any criminal activity relating to or relatable to the scheduled
offence.
67. The argument of the petitioners that the second proviso permits emergency attachment in
disregard of the safeguard provided in the first proviso regarding filing of report (charge-sheet)
clearly overlooks that the second proviso contains non obstante clause and, being an exceptional
situation, warrants "immediate" action so that the property is not likely to frustrate any proceeding
under the 2002 Act. Concededly, there is stipulation fastened upon the authorised officer to record
in writing reasons for his belief on the basis of material in his possession that such "immediate"
action is indispensable. This stipulation has reasonable nexus with the purposes and objects sought
to be achieved by the 2002 Act.
68. It was also urged before us that the attachment of property must be equivalent in value of
the proceeds of crime only if the proceeds of crime are situated outside India. This argument, in our
opinion, is tenuous. For, the definition of "proceeds of crime" is wide enough to not only refer to the
property derived or obtained as a result of criminal activity relating to a scheduled offence, but also
of the value of any such property. If the property is taken or held outside the country, even in such
a case, the property equivalent in value held within the country or abroad can be proceeded with.
The definition of "property" as in section 2(1)(v) is equally wide enough to encompass the value of
the property of proceeds of crime. Such interpretation would further the legislative intent in
recovery of the proceeds of crime and vesting it in the Central Government for effective prevention
of money-laundering.
69. We find force in the stand taken by the Union of India that the objectives of enacting the
2002 Act was the attachment and confiscation of proceeds of crime which is the quintessence so as
to combat the evil of money-laundering. The second proviso, therefore, addresses the broad
objectives of the 2002 Act to reach the proceeds of crime in whosoever's name they are kept or by
whosoever they are held. To buttress this argument, reliance has been placed on the dictum in
Attorney General for India (supra) and Raman Tech. and Process Engg. Co. V. Solanki Traders*
70. The procedural safeguards provided in respect of provisional attachment are effective
measures to protect the interest of the person concerned who is being proceeded with under the
2002 Act, in the following manner as rightly indicated by the Union of India :
(i) For invoking the second proviso, the Director or any officer not below the rank of Deputy
Director will have to first apply his mind to the materials on record before recording in writing his
reasons to believe is certainly a sufficient safeguard to the invocation of the powers under the
second proviso to section 5(1) of the 2002 Act.
(ii) There has to be a satisfaction that if the property involved in money-laundering or
"proceeds of crime" are not attached "immediately", such non-attachment might frustrate the
confiscation proceedings under the 2002 Act.
(iii) The order passed under section 5(1) of the 2002 Act is only provisional in nature. The life
of this provisional attachment order passed under section 5(1) of the 2002 Act is only for 180
days, subject to confirmation by an independent adjudicating authority.
(iv) Under section 5(2) officer passing provisional attachment order has to immediately
forward a copy of this order to the adjudicating authority in a sealed envelope.
(v) Under section 5(5) of the 2002 Act, the officer making such order must file a complaint
before the adjudicating authority within 30 days of the order of provisional attachment being
made.
(vi) Section 5(3) of the 2002 Act provides that the provisional attachment order shall cease to
have effect on the expiry of the period specified in section 5(1), i. e., 180 days or on the date
when the adjudicating authority makes an order under section 8(2), whichever is earlier.
(vii) Under section 8(1), once the officer making the provisional attachment order files a
complaint and if the adjudicating authority "has a reason to believe that any person has
committed an offence under section 3 or is in possession of the proceeds of crime", the
adjudicating authority may serve a show-cause notice of not less than 30 days on such person
calling upon him to indicate the sources of his income, earning or assets or by means of which
he has acquired the property attached under section 5(1) of the 2002 Act.
(viii) The above show-cause notice would require the noticee to produce evidence on which he
relies and other relevant information and particulars to show cause why all or any of the property
"should not be declared to be the properties involved in money-laundering and confiscated by
the Central Government".
(ix) Section 8(2) requires the adjudicating authority to consider the reply to the show-cause
notice issued under section 8(1) of the 2002 Act. The section further provides to hear the
aggrieved person as well as the
officer issuing the order of provisional attachment and also take into account "all relevant
materials placed on record before the adjudicating authority". After following the above
procedure, the adjudicating authority will record its finding whether all the properties referred to
in the show- cause notice are involved in money-laundering or not.
(x) While passing order under section 8(2) read with section 8(3) there are two possibilities
which might happen
(a) the adjudicating authority may confirm the order of provisional attachment, in which
case again, the confirmation will continue only up to
(i) the period of investigation not exceeding 365 days, or
(ii) till the pendency of any proceedings relating to any offence under the 2002 Act or
under the correspondina law of anv other country before the competent court of criminal
jurisdiction outside India.
(b) the adjudicating authority may disagree and not confirm the provisional attachment, in
which case attachment over the property ceases.
(xi) Under section 8(4) of the 2002 Act, upon confirmation of the order of provisional
attachment, the Director or other officer authorized by him shall take the possession of property
attached.
(xii) Under section 8(5) of the 2002 Act, on the conclusion of a trial for an offence under the
2002 Act if the special court finds that the offence of money-laundering has been committed it
will order that the property involved in money-laundering or the property which has been
involved in the commission of the offence of money-laundering shall stand confiscated to the
Central Government.
(xiii) However, under section 8(6) if the special court on the conclusion of the trial finds that
no offence of money-laundering has taken place or the property is not involved in money-
laundering it will release the property which has been attached to the person entitled to receive
it.
(xiv) Under section 8(7), if the trial before the special court cannot be conducted because of
the death of the accused or because the accused is declared proclaimed offender, then the
special court on an application of the Director or a person claiming to be entitled to possession of
a property in respect of which an order under section 8(3) is passed either to confiscate the
property or release the property to the claimant, after considering the material before it.
(xv) Under section 8(8), when a property is confiscated, special court may direct the Central
Government to restore the property to a person with the legitimate interest in the property, who
may have suffered a quantifiable loss as a result of money-laundering. Provided that the person
must
not have been involved in money-laundering and must have acted in a good faith and has
suffered a considerable loss despite taking all reasonable precautions.
(xvi) The order passed by the adjudicating authority is also subject to appeal before the
Appellate Tribunal which is constituted under section 25 of the 2002 Act. Thus, the adjudicating
authority is not the final authority under the 2002 Act as far as the attachment of proceeds of
crime or property involved in money-laundering is concerned.
(xvii) Any person aggrieved of an order confirming the provisional attachment order can file
an appeal before the Appellate Tribunal under section 26(1) of the 2002 Act. The Appellate
Tribunal on receipt of an appeal after giving the parties an opportunity of being heard will pass
an order as it thinks fit either confirming or modifying or setting aside the provisional
attachment order appealed against.
(xviii) Further, the order passed by the Appellate Tribunal is further appealable before the
High Court under section 42 of the 2002 Act on any question of fact or question of law arising
out of the order passed by the Appellate Tribunal.
It is, thus, clear that the provision in the form of section 5 provides for a balancing
arrangement to secure the interest of the person as well as to ensure that the proceeds of crime
remain available for being dealt with in the manner provided by the 2002 Act. This provision, in
our opinion, has reasonable nexus with the objects sought to be achieved by the 2002 Act in
preventing and regulating money-laundering effectively. The constitutional validity including
interpretation of section 5 has already been answered against the petitioners by different High
Courts*. We do not wish to dilate on those decisions for the view already expressed hitherto.
Section 8 of the 2002 Act
71. This section is part of Chapter III dealing with attachment, adjudication and confiscation. It
provides for the procedure and safeguards to be adhered to by the authorities referred to in section
48 and in particular the adjudicating authority appointed by the Central Government under section
6, for dealing with the complaint filed by the authorised officer under section 5(5) of the 2002 Act
or applications made under section 17(4) or 18(10) of the 2002 Act. This is a wholesome provision,

interest of the person concerned, but affording him/her fair opportunity during the adjudication
process. This section, as amended from time to time and as applicable to the present cases, reads
thus :
"8. Adjudication.-(1) On receipt of a complaint under sub-section (5) of section 5, or
applications made under sub-section (4) of section 17 or under sub-section (10) of section 18, if
the adjudicating authority has reason to believe that any person has committed an *(offence
under section 3 or is in possession of proceeds of crime), he may serve a notice of not less than
thirty days on such person calling upon him to indicate the sources of his income, earning or
assets, out of which or by means of which he has acquired the property attached under sub-
section (1) of section 5, or, seized *(or frozen) under section 17 or section 18, the evidence on
which he relies and other relevant information and particulars, and to show cause why all or any
of such properties should not be declared to be the properties involved in money-laundering and
confiscated by the Central Government :
Provided that where a notice under this sub-section specifies any property as being held by
a person on behalf of any other person, a copy of such notice shall also be served upon such
other person :
Provided further that where such property is held jointly by more than one person, such
notice shall be served to all persons holding such property.
(2) The adjudicating authority shall, after-
(a) considering the reply, if any, to the notice issued under sub- section (1) ;
(b) hearing the aggrieved person and the Director or any other officer authorised by him
in this behalf ; and
(c) taking into account all relevant materials placed on record before him,
by an order, record a finding whether all or any of the properties referred to in the notice
issued under sub-section (1) are involved in money-laundering :
Provided that if the property is claimed by a person, other than a person to whom the
notice had been issued, such person shall also be

be prescribed, may also direct the Central Government to restore such confiscated property
or part thereof of a claimant with a legitimate interest in the property, who may have suffered
a quantifiable loss as a result of the offence of money-laundering :
Provided that the special court shall not consider such claim unless it is satisfied that
the claimant has acted in good faith and has suffered the loss despite having taken all
reasonable precautions and is not involved in the offence of money-laundering
*Provided further that the special court may, if it thinks fit, consider the claim of the
claimant for the purposes of restoration of such properties during the trial of the case in
such manner as may be prescribed."
72. The grievance of the petitioners in respect of this provision is broadly about the period
of
attachment specified under section 8(3)(a) and the modality of taking possession of the property
under section 8(4) of the 2002 Act. As a result, we will confine our discussion to the dispensation
provided in the stated sub-sections. Reverting to sub-section (3), it postulates that where the
adjudicating authority records a finding whether all or any of the properties referred to in the show-
cause notice issued under sub-section (1) by the adjudicating authority consequent to receipt of a
complaint/application that the property in question is involved in money- laundering, he shall, by
an order in writing confirm the attachment (provisional) of property made under section 5(1) or
retention of property or record seized or frozen under section 17 or section 18, and direct
continuation of the attachment or retention or freezing of the concerned property for a period not
exceeding three hundred and sixty-five days or the pendency of the proceedings relating to any
offence under the 2002 Act before a court or under the corresponding law of any country outside
India and become final after an order of confiscation is passed under sub-section (5) or sub-section
(7) of section 8 or section 58B or section 60(2A) by the special court. The Explanation added
thereat vide Act 7 of 2019 stipulates the method of computing the period of three hundred and
sixty-five days after reckoning the stay order of the court, if any. The argument proceeds that the
period of attachment mentioned in section 8(3)(a) of the 2002 Act does not clearly provide for the
consequence of non-filing of the complaint within three hundred and sixty-five days from the date
of attachment (provisional). This argument clearly overlooks the obligation on the Director or any
other officer who provisionally attaches any property under section
* Inserted by Act 13 of 2018, section 208(c)(ii) (with effect from April 19, 2018, vide G. S. .383
(E), dated April 19, 2018).
5(1), to file a complaint stating the fact of such attachment before the adjudicating authority within
thirty days in terms of section 5(5) of the 2002 Act. Concededly, filing of complaint before the
adjudicating authority in terms of section 5(5) within thirty days from the provisional attachment
for confirmation of such order of provisional attachment is different than the complaint to be filed
before the special court under section 44(1)(b) for initiating criminal action regarding offence of
money-laundering punishable under section 4 of the 2002 Act. Furthermore, the provisional
attachment would operate only for a period of one hundred and eighty days from the date of order
passed under section 5(1) of the 2002 Act in terms of that provision. Whereas, section 8(3) refers
to the period of three hundred and sixty-five days from the passing of the order under sub-section
(2) of section 8 by the adjudicating authority and confirming the provisional attachment order and
the order of confirmation of attachment operates until the confiscation order is passed or becomes
final in terms of order passed under section 8(5) or 8(7) or 58B or 60(2A) by the special court. The
order of confirmation of attachment could also last during the pendency of the proceedings relating
to the offence of money-laundering under the 2002 Act, or before the competent court of criminal
jurisdiction outside India, as the case may be. We need not elaborate on this aspect any further
and leave the parties to agitate this aspect in appropriate proceedings as it is not about the
constitutional validity of the provision as such.
73. The other grievance of the petitioners is in reference to the stipulation in sub-section (4) of
The surest way t legal research!"
section 8 providing for taking possession of the property. This provision ought to be invoked only in
exceptional situation keeping in mind the peculiar facts of the case. In that, merely because the
provisional attachment order passed under section 5(1) is confirmed, it does not follow that the
property stands confiscated ; and until an order of confiscation is formally passed, there is no
reason to hasten the process of taking possession of such property. The principle set out in section
5(4) of the 2002 Act needs to be extended even after confirmation of provisional attachment order
until a formal confiscation order is passed. section 5(4) clearly states that nothing in section 5
including the order of provisional attachment shall prevent the person interested in the enjoyment
of immovable property attached under sub-section (1) from such enjoyment. The need to take
possession of the attached property would arise only for giving effect to the order of confiscation.
This is also because sub-section (6) of section 8 postulates that where on conclusion of a trial under
the 2002 Act which is obviously in respect of offence of money-laundering, the special court finds
that the offence of money-laundering has not taken place or the property is not involved in money-
laundering, it shall order release of such property to the person entitled to receive it. Once the
possession of the property is taken in terms of sub-section (4) and the finding in favour of the
person is rendered by the special court thereafter and during the interregnum if the property
changes hands and title vest in some third party, it would result in civil consequences even to third
party. That is certainly avoidable unless it is absolutely necessary in the peculiar facts of a
particular case so as to invoke the option available under sub-section (4) of section 8.
74. Indisputably, statutory Rules have been framed by the Central Government in exercise of
powers under section 73 of the 2002 Act regarding the manner of taking possession of attached or
frozen properties confirmed by the adjudicating authority in 2013, and also regarding restoration of
confiscated property in 2019. Suffice it to observe that direction under section 8(4) for taking
possession of the property in question before a formal order of confiscation is passed merely on the
basis of confirmation of provisional attachment order, should be an exception and not a rule. That
issue will have to be considered on case-to-case basis. Upon such harmonious construction of the
relevant provisions, it is not possible to countenance challenge to the validity of sub-section (4) of
section 8 of the 2002 Act.
75. The learned counsel appearing for the Union of India, had invited our attention to the
recommendations made by FATF in 2003 and 2012 to justify the provision under consideration. The
fact that non-conviction based confiscation model is permissible, it does not warrant an extreme
and drastic action of physical dispossession of the person from the property in every case-which
can be industrial/commercial/business and also residential property, until a formal order of
confiscation is passed under section 8(5) or 8(7) of the 2002 Act. As demonstrated earlier, it is
possible that the special court in the trial concerning money-laundering offence may eventually
decide the issue in favour of the person in possession of the property as not being proceeds of
crime or for any other valid ground. Before such order is passed by the special court, it would be a
case of serious miscarriage of justice, if not abuse of process to take physical possession of the
property held by such person. Further, it would serve no purpose by hastening the process of
taking possession of the property and then returning the same back to the same person at a later
date pursuant to the order passed by the court of competent jurisdiction. Moreover, for the view
taken by us while interpretating section 3 of the 2002 Act regarding the offence of money-
laundering, it can proceed only if it is established that the person has directly or indirectly derived
or obtained proceeds of crime as a result of criminal activity relating to or relatable to a scheduled
offence or was involved in any process or activity connected with proceeds of crime.
76. It is unfathomable as to how the action of confiscation can be resorted to in respect of
property in the event of his acquittal or discharge in connection with the scheduled offence.
Resultantly, we would sum up by observing that the provision in the form of section 8(4) can be
resorted to only by way of an exception and not as a rule. The analogy drawn by the Union of India
on the basis of decisions of this court in Divisional Forest Officer V. G. V. Sudhakar Rao*, Biswanath
Bhattacharya (supra), Yogendra Kumar Jaiswal V. State of Bihar**, will be of no avail in the context
of the scheme of attachment, confiscation and vesting of proceeds of crime in the Central
Government provided for in the 2002 Act.
Searches and seizures
77. After having traversed through the provisions of Chapters I to III, we may now turn to other
contentious provision in Chapter V of the 2002 Act, dealing with summons, searches and seizures,
etc. Section 16 provides for power of survey bestowed upon the authorities under the 2002 Act.
They have been empowered to enter upon any place within the limits of the area assigned to them
or in respect of which, has been specifically authorised for the purposes of section 16 by the
competent authority, for inspection of records or other matters, in the event, it has reason to
believe on the basis of material in possession that an offence under section 3 of the 2002 Act has
been committed. However, when it comes to search and seizure, section 17 of the 2002 Act permits
only the Director or any other officer not below the rank of Deputy Director authorised by him to
exercise that power on the basis of information in his possession and having reason to believe that
any person has committed some act which constitutes money-laundering or is in possession of
proceeds of crime involved in money-laundering, including the records and property relating to
money-laundering. Section 17 of the 2002 Act, as amended, reads thus :
"17. Search and seizure.-(1) Where **the Director or any other officer not below the rank of
Deputy Director authorised by him for the purposes of this section, on the basis of information in
his possession, has reason to believe (the reason for such belief to be recorded in writing) that
any person-
(i) has committed any act which constitutes money-laundering, or

**(iv) is in possession of any property related to crime,
then, subject to the rules made in this behalf, he may authorise any officer subordinate to
him to-
(a) enter and search any building, place, vessel, vehicle or aircraft where he has reason
to suspect that such records or proceeds of crime are kept ;
(b) break open the lock of any door, box, locker, safe, almirah or other receptacle for
exercising the powers conferred by clause (a) where the keys thereof are not available ;
(c) seize any record or property found as a result of such search ;
(d) place marks of identification on such record or

or

(e) make a note or an inventory of such record or property ;
(f) examine on oath any person, who is found to be in possession or control of any
record or property, in respect of all matters relevant for the purposes of any investigation
under this Act :

21 of 2009,section 7(ii) (with effect from June 1, 2009). The proviso, before omission,
stood asunder :"Provided that no search shall be conducted unless, in relation to the
scheduled offence,a report has been forwarded to a magistrate under section 157 of the
Code of CriminalProcedure, 1973 (2 of 1974) or a complaint has been filed by a person,

*(1A) Where it is not practicable to seize such record or property, the officer authorised
under sub-section (1), may make an order to freeze such property whereupon the property

making such order, and a copy of such order shall be served on the person concerned :
Provided that if, at any time before its confiscation under sub-section (5) or sub-section (7)

frozen property, the officer authorised under sub-section (1) may seize such property.

As noticed from the amended provision, it has been amended vide Act 21 of 2009, Act 2 of
2013 and finally by the Finance (No. 2) Act, 2019. The challenge is essentially in respect
of
deletion of proviso vide Finance (No. 2) Act, 2019-which provides that no search shall be
conducted unless, in relation to the scheduled offence, a report has been forwarded to a
magistrate under section 157 of the 1973 Code or a complaint has been filed by a person,
authorised to investigate the offence mentioned in the Schedule, before a magistrate or court for
taking cognizance of the scheduled offence, as the case may be, or in cases where such report is
not required to be forwarded, a similar report of information received or otherwise has been
submitted by an officer authorised to investigate a scheduled offence to an officer not below the
rank of Additional Secretary to the Government of India or equivalent being Head of the Office or

Ministry or Department or Unit, as the case may be, or any other officer who may be authorised
by the Central Government, by notification, for this purpose. Further, the challenge is about no
safeguards, as provided under the 1973 Code regarding searches and seizures, have been
envisaged and that such drastic power is being exercised without a formal FIR registered or
complaint filed in respect of scheduled offence. The provision is, therefore, unconstitutional.
78. These challenges have been rightly refuted by the Union of India on the argument that the
2002 Act is a self-contained Code and the dispensation envisaged thereunder, must prevail in
terms of section 71* of the 2002 Act, which predicates that the provisions of the 2002 Act have
effect notwithstanding anything inconsistent therewith contained in any other law for the time
being in force, which includes the provisions of the 1973 Code. Even section 65** of the 2002 Act
predicates that the provisions of the 1973 Code shall apply, insofar as they are not inconsistent
with the provisions of the 2002 Act in respect of arrest, search and seizure, attachment,
confiscation, investigation, prosecution and all other proceedings under the 2002 Act. To bolster
this submission, reliance is also placed on sections
* 71. Act to have overriding effect.-The provisions of this Act shall have effect notwithstanding
anything inconsistent therewith contained in any other law for the time being in force.
65. Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 to apply.-The provisions of the Code of
CriminalProcedure, 1973 (2 of 1974) shall apply, insofar as they are not inconsistent with the
provisionsof this Act, to arrest, search and seizure, attachment, confiscation
investigation, prosecution and all other proceedings under this Act.
4. Trial of offences under the Indian Penal Code and other laws.-(1) All offences under
theIndia Penal Code (45 of 1860) shall be investigated, inquired into, tried, and otherwisedealt
with according to the provisions hereinafter contained.(2) All offences under any other law shall be
investigated, inquired into, tried, and otherwisedealt with according to the same provisions, but
subject to any enactment for thetime being in force regulating the manner or place of investigating,
inquiring into, tryingor otherwise dealing with such offences.
and 5* of the 1973 Code. Section 4(2) pertains to offences under other laws (other than IPC) which
are required to be investigated, inquired into, tried, and otherwise dealt with according to the same
provisions, but subject to any enactment for the time being in force regulating the manner or place
of investigating, inquiring into, trying or otherwise dealing with such offences. Similarly, section 5
of the 1973 Code envisages that nothing in the 1973 Code shall, in the absence of a specific
provision to the contrary, affect any special or local law for the time being in force, or any special
jurisdiction or power conferred, or any special form of procedure prescribed, by any other law for
the time being in force.
79. Undoubtedly, the 2002 Act is a special self-contained law ; and section 17 is a provision,
specifically dealing with the matters concerning searches and seizures in connection with the
offence of money-laundering to be inquired into and the proceeds of crime dealt with under the
2002 Act. We have already noted in the earlier part of this judgment that before resorting to action
of provisional attachment, registration of scheduled offence or complaint filed in that regard, is not
a precondition. The authorised officer can still invoke power of issuing order of provisional
attachment and contemporaneously send information to the jurisdictional police about the
commission of scheduled offence and generation of property as a result of criminal activity relating
to a scheduled offence, which is being made subject matter of provisional attachment. Even in the
matter of searches and seizures under the 2002 Act, that power can be exercised only by the
Director or any other officer not below the rank of Deputy Director authorised by him. They are not
only high-ranking officials, but have to be fully satisfied that there is reason to believe on the basis
of information in their possession about commission of offence of money-laundering or possession
of proceeds of crime involved in money-laundering. Such reason(s) to believe is required to be
recorded in writing and contemporaneously forwarded to the adjudicating authority along with the
material in his possession in a sealed envelope to be preserved by the adjudicating authority for
period as is prescribed under the Rules framed in that regard. Such are the in-built safeguards
provided in the 2002 Act. The proviso as it existed prior to 2019 was obviously corresponding to the
stipulation in the first proviso in section 5. However, for strengthening the mechanism, including
regarding prevention of money-laundering, Parliament in its wisdom deemed it appropriate to drop
the proviso in sub-section (1) of section 17
* 5. Saving.-Nothing contained in this Code shall, in the absence of a specific provision tothe
contrary, affect any special or local law for the time being in force, or any special jurisdictionor
power conferred, or any special from of procedure prescribed, by any other lawfor the time being in
force.
of the 2002 Act, thereby dispensing with the condition that no search shall be conducted unless in
relation to the scheduled offence a report has been forwarded to a magistrate under section 157 of
the 1973 Code or a complaint has been filed before a magistrate in regard to such offence. As it is
indisputable that the 2002 Act is a special Act and is a self-contained Code regarding the subject of
searches and seizures in connection with the offence of money-laundering under the 2002 Act,
coupled with the fact that the purpose and object of the 2002 Act is prevention of money-
laundering ; and the offence of money-laundering being an independent offence concerning the
process and activity connected with the proceeds of crime, the deletion of the first proviso has
reasonable nexus with the objects sought to be achieved by the 2002 Act for strengthening the
mechanism of prevention of money-laundering and to secure the proceeds of crime for being dealt
with appropriately under the 2002 Act.
80. As aforementioned, section 17 provides for in-built safeguards, not only mandating exercise
of power by high ranking officials, of the rank of Director (not below the rank of Additional
Secretary to the Government of India who is appointed by a Committee chaired by the Central
Vigilance Commissioner in terms of section 25 of the CVC Act) or Deputy Director authorised by the
Director in that regard, but also to adhere to other stipulations of recording of reasons regarding
the belief formed on the basis of information in his possession about commission of offence of
money-laundering and possession of proceeds of crime involved in money-laundering. Further, such
recorded reasons along with the materials is required to be forwarded to the three-member
adjudicating authority (appointed under section 6 of the 2002 Act headed by a person qualified for
appointment as District Judge) in a sealed cover to be preserved for specified period, thus,
guaranteeing fairness, transparency and accountability regarding the entire process of search and
seizure. This is unlike the provision in the 1973 Code where any police officer including the head
constable can proceed to search and seize records or property merely on the basis of allegation or
suspicion of commission of a scheduled offence.
81. Concededly, the 2002 Act provides for an inquiry to be conducted by the authorities and
with power to collect evidence for being submitted to the adjudicating authority for consideration of
confirmation of provisional attachment order passed by the authorities in respect of properties
being proceeds of crime involved in the offence of money-laundering. In that sense, the provisions
in 2002 Act are not only to investigate into the offence of money-laundering, but more importantly
to prevent money-
laundering and to provide for confiscation of property related to money- laundering and matters
connected therewith and incidental thereto.
82. The process of searches and seizures under the 2002 Act are, therefore, not only for the
purposes of inquiring into the offence of money-laundering, but also for the purposes of prevention
of money-laundering. This is markedly distinct from the process of investigating into a scheduled
offence.
83. It is pertinent to note that if the action taken by the authority under the 2002 Act, including
regarding searches and seizures, is eventually found to be without reasons recorded in writing,
would entail punishment for vexatious search under section 62 of the 2002 Act. Such being the
stringent safeguards provided under section 17 of the 2002 Act and Rules framed regarding the
process of searches and seizures concerning the offence of money-laundering and for prevention of
money-laundering including attachment of proceeds of crime, it is unfathomable as to how the
challenge under consideration can be countenanced. We may usefully advert to the decision of
Constitution Bench of this court in Pooran Mal (supra), which had dealt with similar power
entrusted to the Director of Inspection or the Commissioner under the Income-tax Act, 1961 (also
see Income-tax Officer, Special Investigation Circle-B, Meerut (supra)). To the same end is the
decision in R. S. Seth Gopikisan Agarwal V. R. N. Sen, Assistant Collector of Customs*, dealing with
sections 105 and 136 of the Customs Act. In the case of Dr. Partap Singh (supra), this court upheld
the dispensation provided in section 37 of the FERA by adopting purposive interpretation to give
full play to the legislative intent and negating the argument regarding incorporation of the
provisions of the 1973 Code by pen and ink in that section, as is the argument advanced before us.
84. As noticed earlier, in terms of section 17(2) of the 2002 Act immediately after the search
and seizure, the authority conducting the search is obliged to forward a copy of the reasons
recorded and materials in his possession to the adjudicating authority in a sealed envelope. This
sealed envelope is required to be preserved for period as specified under the Rules framed in that
regard so that it is not tempered with in any manner and to ensure fairness of the procedure
including accountability of the authority. Not only that, in terms of section 7(4) of the 2002 Act
the authority seizing the record or property is obliged to submit an application before the
adjudicating authority within a period of thirty days therefrom for the retention of the said record
and adjudicating authority in turn gives opportunity to be heard by issuing show-cause notice to
the person concerned before
* (1967) 2 SCR 340.
passing order of retention of record or property, as the case may be, under the 2002 Act and the
Rules framed therefor. The authorities carrying out search and seizure is also made accountable by
providing for punishment under section 62 of the 2002 Act for vexatious search and giving false
information. All these in-built safeguards prevent arbitrary exercise or misuse of power by the
authorities appointed under the 2002 Act.
85. The emphasis placed on section 102 of the 1973 Code regarding seizure procedure by the
petitioners, is of no avail. That provision does not provide for any safeguard prior to a seizure as is
provided under section 17 of the 2002 Act and the Rules framed thereunder. As noted earlier, it can
be made even by a head constable as the expression used is "any police officer" that too merely on
the basis of an allegation or suspicion of commission of an offence. In case of search, section 165 of
the 1973 Code empowers the officer in-charge of a police station or a police officer making an
investigation to take recourse to that in the event he has reasonable grounds for believing that it
would be necessary to do so for investigating into any offence. This power can be exercised by any
police officer (irrespective of his rank) investigating into an offence. Suffice it to observe that the
power of search and seizure entrusted to the authorities under section 17 of the 2002 Act, is a
special self-contained provision and is different from the general provisions in the 1973 Code,
which, therefore, ought to prevail in terms of section 71 of the 2002 Act. Further, in view of the in-
built safeguards and stringent stipulations to be adhered to by the authorities under the 2002 Act,
it ought to be regarded as reasonable provision having nexus with the purposes and objects sought
to be achieved by the 2002 Act. It is certainly not an arbitrary power at all.
86. It was urged that rule 3(2) proviso in the 2005 Rules regarding forms, search and seizure or
freezing and the manner of forwarding the reasons and material to the adjudicating authority,
impounding and custody of records and the period of retention, remained unamended despite
deletion of the proviso in section 17(1) of the 2002 Act vide Finance (No. 2) Act, 2019. In the first
place, it is unfathomable that the effect of amending Act is being questioned on the basis of
unamended rule. It is well-settled that if the rule is not consistent with the provisions of the Act,
the amended provisions in the Act must prevail. The statute cannot be declared ultra vires on the
basis of rule framed under the statute. The precondition in the proviso in rule 3(2) cannot be read
into section 17 of the 2002 Act, more so contrary to the legislative intent in deleting the proviso in
section 17(1) of the 2002 Act. In any case, it is open to the Central Government to take necessary
corrective steps to obviate confusion caused on account of the subject proviso, if any.
Search of persons
87. The subject of search of persons is dealt with in section 18 of the 2002 Act forming part of
Chapter V. Even in respect of this provision, the challenge is essentially founded on the deletion of
proviso in sub-section (1) of section 18 vide Finance (No. 2) Act, 2019 which was pari materia with
the proviso in section 17(1) of the 2002 Act-stipulating that no search of any person shall be
made unless in relation to the scheduled offence a report has been forwarded to a magistrate under
section 157 of the 1973 Code, etc. Section 18, as amended reads thus :
"18. Search of persons.-(1) If an authority, authorised in this behalf by the Central
Government by general or special order, has reason to believe (the reason for such belief to be
recorded in writing) that any person has secreted about his person or in anything under his
possession, ownership or control, any record or proceeds of crime which may be useful for or
relevant to any proceedings under this Act, he may search that person and seize such record or
property which may be useful for or relevant to any proceedings under this Act :
*[.. .]
(2) The authority, who has been authorised under sub-section (1) shall, immediately after
search and seizure, forward a copy of the reasons so recorded along with material in his
possession, referred to in that sub-section, to the adjudicating authority in a sealed envelope,
in the manner, as may be prescribed and such adjudicating authority shall keep such reasons
and material for such period, as may be prescribed.
*
Proviso omitted by the Finance (No. 2) Act, 2019, section 198 (with effect from August 1,2019).
Earlier the proviso was inserted by Act 21 of 2009, section 8(i) (with effect fromJune 1, 2009) and
substituted by Act 2 of 2013, section 15 (with effect from February 15,2013, vide S. O. 343(E),
dated February 8, 2013). The proviso, before omission, stood asunder "Provided that no search of
any person shall be made unless, in relation to the scheduledoffence, a report has been forwarded
to a Magistrate under section 157 of the Code ofCriminal Procedure, 1973 (2 of 1974) or a
complaint has been filed by a person, authorisedto investigate the offence mentioned in the
Schedule, before a magistrate or courtfor taking cognizance of the scheduled offence, as the case
may be, or in cases wheresuch report is not required to be forwarded, a similar report of
information received orotherwise has been submitted by an officer authorised to investigate a
scheduled offenceto an officer not below the rank of Additional Secretary to the Government of
India orequivalent being head of the office or Ministry or Department or Unit, as the case maybe, or
any other officer who may be authorised by the Central Government, by notification, for this
purpose".
(3) Where an authority is about to search any person, he shall, if such person so requires,
take such person within twenty-four hours to the nearest Gazetted Officer, superior in rank to
him, or a Magistrate :
Provided that the period of twenty-four hours shall exclude the time necessary for the
journey undertaken to take such person to the nearest Gazetted Officer, superior in rank to
him, or magistrate's court.
(4) If the requisition under sub-section (3) is made, the authority shall not detain the
person for more than twenty-four hours prior to taking him before the Gazetted Officer,
superior in rank to him, or the Magistrate referred to in that sub-section :
Provided that the period of twenty-four hours shall exclude the time necessary for the
journey from the place of detention to the office of the Gazetted Officer, superior in rank to
him, or the magistrate's court.
(5) The Gazetted Officer or the magistrate before whom any such person is brought shall, if
he sees no reasonable ground for search, forthwith discharge such person but otherwise shall
direct that search be made.
(6) Before making the search under sub-section (1) or sub-section (5), the authority shall
call upon two or more persons to attend and witness the search, and the search shall be made
in the presence of such persons.
(7) The authority shall prepare a list of record or property seized in the course of the search
and obtain the signatures of the witnesses on the list.
(8) No female shall be searched by any one except a female.
(9) The authority shall record the statement of the person searched under sub-section (1)
or sub-section (5) in respect of the records or proceeds of crime found or seized in the course
of the search :
*[...]
* Proviso omitted by Act 21 of 2009, section 8(ii) (with effect from June 1, 2009). Proviso,befor
omission, stood as under :"Provided that no search of any person shall be made unless, in relation
to an offenceunder (a) Paragraph 1 of Part A or Paragraph 1 or Paragraph 2 or Paragraph 3 or
Paragraph 4 orParagraph 5 of Part B of the Schedule, a report has been forwarded to a
Magistrateunder section 173 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (2 of 1974) ; or(b) Paragraph
2 of Part A of the Schedule, a police report or a complaint has been filedfor taking cognizance of an
offence by the special court constituted under sub-section(1) of section 36 of the Narcotic Drugs
and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985 (61 of1985)."
(10) The authority, seizing any record or property under sub-section (1) shall, within a
period of thirty days from such seizure, file an application requesting for retention of such
record or property, before the adjudicating authority."
For the reasons noted to negate the challenge to the deletion of proviso in section 17(1) of
the 2002 Act, the same would apply with full force for rejecting the same argument in respect
of deletion of proviso in section 18(1) of the 2002 Act. Suffice it to observe that even under
section 18 of the 2002 Act, the Authority authorised to exercise power of search of person is
obliged to adhere to identical in-built safeguards as in the case of exercise of power under
section 17 of the 2002 Act. In addition to the similar safeguards in terms of section 18(3) of
the 2002 Act, the authority is obliged to take the person who is about to be searched to a
Gazetted Officer or a magistrate before the search of such person is carried out. The
Constitution Bench of this court while dealing with similar provisions of NDPS Act in State of
Punjab V. Baldev Singh* upheld the search of person procedure being a fair and reasonable
procedure. In paragraph 25 of the said decision, this court observed as follows :
"25. To be searched before a Gazetted Officer or a Magistrate, if the suspect so requires, is
an extremely valuable right which the legislature has given to the person concerned having
regard to the grave consequences that may entail the possession of illicit articles under the
NDPS Act. It appears to have been incorporated in the Act keeping in view the severity of the
punishment. The rationale behind the provision is even otherwise manifest. The search before
a Gazetted Officer or a Magistrate would impart much more authenticity and creditworthiness
to the search and seizure proceeding. It would also verily strengthen the prosecution case.
There is, thus, no justification for the empowered officer, who goes to search the person, on
prior information, to effect the search, of not informing the person concerned of the existence
of his right to have his search conducted before a Gazetted Officer or a Magistrate, so as to
enable him to avail of that right. It is, however, not necessary to give the information to the
person to be searched about his right in writing. It is sufficient if such information is
communicated to the person concerned orally and as far as possible in the presence of some
independent and respectable persons witnessing the arrest and search. The prosecution must,
however, at the trial, establish that the empowered officer had
conveyed the information to the person concerned of his right of being searched in the
presence of a Magistrate or a Gazetted Officer, at the time of the intended search. Courts have
to be satisfied at the trial of the case about due compliance with the requirements provided in
section 50. No presumption under section 54 of the Act can be raised against an accused,
unless the prosecution establishes it to the satisfaction of the court, that the requirements of
section 50 were duly complied with."
Additionally, under section 18(5) of the 2002 Act, if the person to be searched is taken to a
Gazetted Officer or the Magistrate, then such Officer or Magistrate may release the person if
there is no ground for search and under section 18(6), the Authority is obliged to call at least
two witnesses to attend to witness the search, in whose presence, the search is to be carried
out. In terms of section 18(7), the Authority seizing any property during the search of such a
person has to prepare a list of the record or the property seized which is required to be signed
by the witnesses to ensure that no tempering thereof takes place later on. In case, search of a
female is to be carried out, in terms of section 18(8), it could be done only by a female.
Significantly, the Authority seizing any record or property during the search of the person, is
obliged to submit an application to the Adjudicating Authority within thirty days for
permitting retention of record or property. On such application, the Adjudicating Authority
gives opportunity of hearing to the person concerned as to why record or property should not
be retained in terms of section 18(10). Such in-built safeguards are provided to secure the
interest of the person being subjected to search, at the same time for strengthening the
mechanism regarding prevention of money-laundering and attachment of proceeds of crime.
Merely because section 165 of the 1973 Code provides for a different mechanism regarding
search by the police officer, that will be of no consequence for dealing with the
inquiry/investigation and adjudication including prosecution under the 2002 Act. Suffice it to
observe that the provision in the form of section 18, as amended, is a special provision and is
certainly not arbitrary much less manifestly arbitrary. Instead, we hold that the amended
provision in section 18 has reasonable nexus with the purposes and objects sought to be
achieved by the 2002 Act of prevention of money-laundering and attachment and confiscation
of property (proceeds of crime) involved in money- laundering, as also prosecution against
the person concerned for offence of money-laundering under section 3 of the 2002 Act.
Arrest
88. Section 19 of the 2002 Act postulates the manner in which arrest of person involved in
money-laundering can be effected. Sub-section (1) of section 19 envisages that the Director,
Deputy Director, Assistant Director, or any other officer authorised in this behalf by the Central
Government, if has material in his possession giving rise to reason to believe that any person has
been guilty of an offence punishable under the 2002 Act, he may arrest such person. Besides the
power being invested in high-ranking officials, section 19 provides for in-built safeguards to be
adhered to by the authorised officers, such as of recording reasons for the belief regarding the
involvement of person in the offence of money-laundering. That has to be recorded in writing and
while effecting arrest of the person, the grounds for such arrest are informed to that person.
Further, the authorised officer has to forward a copy of the order, along with the material in his
possession, in a sealed cover to the Adjudicating Authority, who in turn is obliged to preserve the
same for the prescribed period as per the Rules. This safeguard is to ensure fairness, objectivity
and accountability of the authorised officer in forming opinion as recorded in writing regarding the
necessity to arrest the person being involved in offence of money-laundering. Not only that, it is
also the obligation of the authorised officer to produce the person so arrested before the Special
Court or Judicial Magistrate or a Metropolitan Magistrate, as the case may be, within twenty-four
hours. This production is also to comply with the requirement of section 167 of the 1973 Code.
There is nothing in section 19, which is contrary to the requirement of production under section 167
of the 1973 Code, but being an express statutory requirement under the 2002 Act in terms of
section 19(3), it has to be complied by the authorised officer. Section 19, as amended from time to
time, reads thus :
"19. Power to arrest.-(1) If the Director, Deputy Director, Assistant Director or any other officer
authorised in this behalf by the Central Government by general or special order, has on the basis of
material in his possession, reason to believe (the reason for such belief to be recorded in writing)
that any person has been guilty of an offence punishable under this Act, he may arrest such person
and shall, as soon as may be, inform him of the grounds for such arrest.
(2) The Director, Deputy Director, Assistant Director or any other officer shall, immediately after
arrest of such person under sub-section (1), forward a copy of the order along with the material in
his possession, referred to in that sub-section, to the Adjudicating
Authority in a sealed envelope, in the manner, as may be prescribed and such Adjudicating
Authority shall keep such order and material for such period, as may be prescribed.
(3) Every person arrested under sub-section (1) shall, within twenty-four hours, be taken to a
*Special Court or Judicial Magistrate or a Metropolitan Magistrate, as the case may be, having
jurisdiction :
Provided that the period of twentv-four hours shall exclude the time necessary for the journev from
The surest way't legal research!"
the place of arrest to the **Special Court or Magistrate's Court."
88. In the context of this provision, the challenge is that in absence of any formal complaint
being filed, arrest under section 19 is being made by the authorised officers. Whereas, the purport
of section 167 of the 1973 Code would suggest that the person can be arrested by the jurisdictional
police without warrant under section 41 of the 1973 Code only upon registration of a complaint
under section 154 of the 1973 Code in connection with cognizable offence or pursuant to the order
of the court. Even, in case of arrest pursuant to the order of the court, a formal complaint against
such person accusing him of being involved in commission of an offence is essential. Moreover, the
person produced before the court would be at a loss to know the grounds for arrest unless a formal
FIR or complaint is filed accusing him about his involvement in the commission of an offence. The
provision if interpreted to permit the authorised officer to arrest someone being involved in the
commission of offence of money-laundering without a formal complaint against him, would be ex
facie manifestly arbitrary and unconstitutional.
89. This argument clearly overlooks the overall scheme of the 2002 Act. As noticed earlier, it is a
comprehensive legislation, not limited to provide for prosecution of person involved in the offence
of money-laundering, but mainly intended to prevent money-laundering activity and confiscate the
proceeds of crime involved in money-laundering. It also provides for prosecuting the person
involved in such activity constituting offence of money-laundering. In other words, this legislation
is an amalgam of different facets including setting up of agencies and mechanisms for co-
ordinating measures for combating money-laundering. Chapter III is a provision to effectuate these
purposes and objectives by attachment,
* Inserted by Act 13 of 2018, section 208(d)(i) (w.e.f. 19-4-2018, vide G. S. R. 383(E), dated 19th
April, 2018).
Inserted by Act 13 of 2018, section 208(d)(ii) (w.e.f. 19-4-2018, vide G. S. R. 383(E), dated
19th April, 2018).
adjudication and confiscation. The adjudication is done by the Adjudicating Authority to confirm the
order of provisional attachment in respect of proceeds of crime involved in money-laundering. For
accomplishing that objective, the authorities appointed under Chapter VIII have been authorised to
make inquiry into all matters by way of survey, searches and seizures of records and property.
These provisions in no way invest power in the Authorities referred to in Chapter VIII of the 2002
Act to maintain law and order or for that matter, purely investigating into a criminal offence. The
inquiry preceding filing of the complaint by the authorities under the 2002 Act, may have the
semblance of an investigation conducted by them. However, it is essentially an inquiry to collect
evidence to facilitate the Adjudicating Authority to decide on the confirmation of provisional
attachment order, including to pass order of confiscation, as a result of which, the proceeds of
crime would vest in the Central Government in terms of section 9 of the 2002 Act. In other words,
the role of the Authorities appointed under Chapter VIII of the 2002 Act is such that they are
tasked with dual role of conducting inquiry and collect evidence to facilitate adjudication
proceedings before the Adjudicating Authority in exercise of powers conferred upon them under
Chapters III and V of the 2002 Act and also to use the same materials to bolster the allegation
against the person concerned by way of a formal complaint to be filed for offence of money-
laundering under the 2002 Act before the Special Court, if the fact situation so warrant. It is not as
if after every inquiry prosecution is launched against all persons found to be involved in the
commission of offence of money-laundering. It is also not unusual to provide for arrest of a person
during such inquiry before filing of a complaint for indulging in alleged criminal activity. The
respondent has rightly adverted to somewhat similar provisions in other legislations, such as
section 35 of FERA and section 102 of Customs Act including the decisions of this court upholding
such power of arrest at the inquiry stage bestowed in the Authorities in the respective legislations.
In Ramesh Chandra Mehta (supra), the Constitution Bench of this court enunciated that section
104 of the Customs Act confers power to arrest upon the Custom Officer if he has reason to believe
that any person in India or within the Indian Customs waters has been guilty of an offence
punishable under section 135 of that Act. Again, in the case of Padam Narain Aggarwal (supra),
while dealing with the provisions of the Customs Act, it noted that the term "arrest" has neither
been defined in the 1973 Code nor in the Indian Penal Code, 1860 nor in any other enactment
dealing with offences. This word has been derived from the French word "arrater" meaning "to stop
or stay". It signifies a restraint of a person. It is,
thus, obliging the person to be obedient to law. Further, arrest may be defined as "the execution of
the command of a court of law or of a duly authorised officer". Even, this decision recognises the
power of the authorised officer to cause arrest during the inquiry to be conducted under the
concerned legislations. While adverting to the safeguards provided under that legislation before
effecting such arrest, the court noted as follows :
"Safeguards against abuse of power
36. From the above discussion, it is amply clear that power to arrest a person by a Customs Officer
is statutory in character and cannot be interfered with. Such power of arrest can be exercised only
in those cases where the Customs Officer has "reason to believe" that a person has been guilty of
an offence punishable under section 132, 133, 135, 135A or 136 of the Act. Thus, the power must
be exercised on objective facts of commission of an offence enumerated and the Customs Officer
has reason to believe that a person sought to be arrested has been guilty of commission of such
offence. The power to arrest thus is circumscribed by objective considerations and cannot be
exercised on whims, caprice or fancy of the officer.
37. The section* also obliges the Customs Officer to inform the person arrested of the grounds of
arrest as soon as may be. The law requires such person to be produced before a Magistrate without
unnecessary delay.
38. The law thus, on the one hand, allows a Customs Officer to exercise power to arrest a person
who has committed certain offences, and on the other hand, takes due care to ensure individual
freedom and liberty by laying down norms and providing safeguards so that the power of arrest is
not abused or misused by the authorities
" (emphasis supplied)
The safeguards provided in the 2002 Act and the preconditions to be fulfilled by the authorised
officer before effecting arrest, as contained in section 19 of the 2002 Act, are equally stringent and
of higher standard. Those safeguards ensure that the authorised officers do not act arbitrarily, but
make them accountable for their judgment about the necessity to arrest any person as being
involved in the commission of offence of money-laundering even before filing of the complaint
before the Special Court under section 44(1)(b) of the 2002 Act in that regard. If the action of the
authorised officer is found to be vexatious, he can be proceeded with and
* Ed. : Section 104 of the Customs Act, 1962.
inflicted with punishment specified under section 62 of the 2002 Act. The safeguards to be adhered
to by the jurisdictional police officer before effecting arrest as stipulated in the 1973 Code, are
certainly not comparable. Suffice it to observe that this power has been given to the high-ranking
officials with further conditions to ensure that there is objectivity and their own accountability in
resorting to arrest of a person even before a formal complaint is filed under section 44(1)(b) of the
2002 Act. Investing of power in the high-ranking officials in this regard has stood the test of
reasonableness in Premium Granites (supra), wherein the court restated the position that
requirement of giving reasons for exercise of power by itself excludes chances of arbitrariness.
Further, in Sukhwinder Pal Bipan Kumar (supra), the court restated the position that where the
discretion to apply the provisions of a particular statute is left with the Government or one of the
highest officers, it will be presumed that the discretion vested in such highest authority will not be
abused. Additionally, the Central Government has framed Rules under section 73 in 2005,
regarding the forms and the manner of forwarding a copy of order of arrest of a person along with
the material to the Adjudicating Authority and the period of its retention. In yet another decision in
Ahmed Noormohmed Bhatti (supra), this court opined that the provision cannot be held to be
unreasonable or arbitrary and, therefore, unconstitutional merely because the authority vested with
the power may abuse his authority. (Also see Manzoor Ali Khan (supra)).
90. Considering the above, we have no hesitation in upholding the validity of section 19 of the
2002 Act. We reject the grounds pressed into service to declare section 19 of the 2002 Act as
unconstitutional. On the other hand, we hold that such a provision has reasonable nexus with the
purposes and objects sought to be achieved by the 2002 Act of prevention of money- laundering
and confiscation of proceeds of crime involved in money-laundering, including to prosecute persons
involved in the process or activity connected with the proceeds of crime so as to ensure that the
proceeds of crime are not dealt with in any manner which may result in frustrating any proceedings
relating to confiscation thereof.
90. Burden of proof
91. The validity of section 24 of the 2002 Act has been assailed. This section has been amended
in 2013 vide Act 2 of 2013. Before that amendment, it read thus :
"24. Burden of proof.- When a person is accused of having committed the offence under section 3,
the burden of proving that proceeds of crime are untainted property shall be on the accused."
The amendment of 2013 was necessitated because of the recommendations made by FATF in 2012,
wherein it was noted that the countries should adopt measures similar to those set forth in the
Vienna Convention, Palermo Convention and Terrorist Financing Convention. The Objects and
Reasons for effecting amendment as appended to the Amendment Bill read thus
:
"The Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002 was enacted to prevent money-laundering and to
provide for confiscation of property derived from, or involved in, money-laundering and for matters
connected therewith or incidental thereto. The aforesaid Act also addresses the international
obligations under the Political Declaration and Global Programme of Action adopted by General
Assembly of the United Nations to prevent money-laundering. The Act was amended in the year
2005 and 2009 to remove the difficulties arisen in implementation of the Act.
The problem of money-laundering is no longer restricted to the geo-political boundaries of any
country. It is a global menace that cannot be contained by any nation alone. In view of this, India
has become a member of the Financial Action Task Force and Asia Pacific Group on money-
laundering, which are committed to the effective implementation and enforcement of
internationally accepted standards against money-laundering and the financing of terrorism.
Consequent to the submission of an action plan to the Financial Action Task Force to bring anti
money-laundering legislation of India at par with the international standards and to obviate some
of the deficiencies in the Act that have been experienced by the implementing agencies, the need
to amend the Prevention of Money-Laundering Act, 2002 became necessary."
The Amendment Bill had proposed substitution of section 24 as under :
"24. In any proceedings relating to proceeds of crime under this Act, unless the contrary is proved,
it shall be presumed that such proceeds of crime is involved in money-laundering."
The Standing Committee of Finance then made some recommendations as follows :
"The Committee recommend that the prescribed onus of proof that the property in question is not
out of proceeds of money-laundering crime, being not only on the accused but also on anyone who
is in possession of the proceeds of crime, should be subject to adequate safeguards to protect the
innocent."
Finally, the provision came to be amended by Act 2 of 2013 which came into force with effect from
February 15, 2013 and reads thus :
"*24. Burden of proof.- In any proceeding relating to proceeds of crime under this Act,-
(a) in the case of a person charged with the offence of money- laundering under section 3, the
authority or court shall, unless the contrary is proved, presume that such proceeds of crime are
involved in money-laundering ; and
(b) in the case of any other person the Authority or court, may presume that such proceeds of
crime are involved in money-laundering."
From the plain language of the amended provision, which is subject matter of assail in these cases
being unconstitutional, clearly indicates that it concerns (all) proceeding(s) relating to proceeds of
crime under the 2002 Act. The expression "proceeding" has not been defined in the 2002 Act or the
1973 Code. However, in the setting in which it has been placed in this provision, as rightly argued
by the learned Additional Solicitor General for the Union of India, it must relate to the proceeding
before the Adjudicating Authority or the Special Court. The proceeding before the authorities
(referred to in Chapter VIII) relates to action taken regarding prevention of offence of money-
laundering and ordering provisional attachment of property derived or obtained, directly or
indirectly, by any person as a result of criminal activity relating to a scheduled offence ; and to
inquire into all matters connected therewith and collect evidence to be presented before the
Adjudicating Authority for consideration of application regarding confirmation of provisional
attachment order as per section 8 of the 2002 Act. This provision (section 24) must, however,
apply to proceeding before the Adjudicating Authority regarding confirmation of provisional
attachment order and eventually for ordering confiscation of the attached property for vesting in
the Central Government under section 9 of the 2002 Act. This is reinforced from the purport of
section 23 of the 2002 Act. Further, it would also apply to proceeding before the Special Court
empowered to try the offence of money-laundering under section 3 of the 2002 Act upon
presentation of a complaint by the authority authorised as per section 44(1)(b) of the 2002 Act.
92. It is, thus, clear that this special provision regarding burden of proof in any proceeding
relating to proceeds of crime under this Act would apply to stated proceeding before the
Adjudicating Authority and not limited to the
*
Substituted by Act 2 of 2013, section 19, for section 24 (w.e.f. 15-2-2013, vide S. O. 343(E),
dated 8-2-2013).
proceeding before the Special Court. That is evident from the plain language, indicative of
applicability of the provision to "any" proceeding before the "Authority" or the "Court". The
expression "Authority" occurring in this provision must be given its proper meaning indicative of
the Adjudicating Authority appointed under section 6 of the 2002 Act to adjudicate on matters
concerning confirmation of provisional attachment order and eventual confiscation and vesting of
the property, if the fact situation so warrant. It is an independent body, free from the control of the
Executive*. It is ordained to deal with civil aspects of the action of attachment and confiscation of
the proceeds of crime and not about the criminality of the offence under section 3 of the 2002 Act.
When this provision is made applicable to the proceeding before the Authority, it would not be
necessary to follow the strict principle of standard of proof beyond reasonable doubt, as applicable
in criminal trials. That principle will have no bearing on the proceeding before the Authority.
However, when the same evidence and provision is relied upon in the proceeding before the Special
Court regarding trial of offence of money-laundering under section 3 of the 2002 Act, it would have
a different connotation in the context of a criminal trial.
93. Be that as it may, this section 24 deals with two situations. The first part concerns the
person charged with the offence of money-laundering under section 3. The second part [clause (b)]
concerns any other person. Taking the second part first, such other person would obviously mean a
person not charged with the offence of money-laundering under section 3 of the 2002 Act. The two
parts, in one sense, are mutually exclusive. If a person is charged with the offence of money-
laundering under section 3 of the 2002 Act owing to a complaint filed by the authority authorised
before the Special Court, clause (a) would trigger in. As regards the second category [clause (b)) of
person, the expression used is "may presume". Whereas, qua the first category [covered under
clause (a)] the expression used is "shall, unless the contrary is proved, presume". In this category,
if a charge is already framed against the person for having committed offence of money-laundering,
it would presuppose that the court framing charge against him was prima facie convinced that the
materials placed before it had disclosed grave suspicion against such person. In such a case, once
the issue of admissibility of materials supporting the factum of grave suspicion about the
involvement of the person in the commission of crime under the 2002 Act, is accepted, in law, the
burden must shift on the person concerned to dispel that suspicion. It would then not be a case of
reversal of burden of proof as such, but one of shifting of burden on him to show that
no offence of money-laundering had been committed and, in any case, the property (proceeds of
crime) was not involved in money-laundering.
Before we proceed to analyse the efficacy of section 24 of the 2002 Act, it may be appropriate to
visit the definition of expressions in the Evidence Act, relevant to answer the issue of standard of
proof in any proceeding. In the interpretation clause, section 3 of the Evidence Act, expression
"fact" has been defined as follows :
"3. Interpretation clause.-In this Act the following words and expressions are used in the following
senses, unless a contrary intention appears from the context
"Fact'.-'Fact' means and includes-
(1) any thing, state of things, or relation of things, capable of being perceived by the senses ;
(2) any mental condition of which any person is conscious."
We need not dilate on the expression "relevant", "facts in issue" and "document". We may usefully
advert to the definition of "evidence", which reads thus :
"3. Interpretation clause.-In this Act the following words and expressions are used in the following
senses, unless a contrary intention appears from the context :
"Evidence'.-'Evidence means and includes-
(1) all statements which the court permits or requires to be made before it by witnesses, in relation
to matters of fact under inquiry,
such statements are called oral evidence ;
(2) *all documents including electronic records produced for the inspection of the court,
such documents are called documentary evidence."
The other relevant definitions are :
"3. Interpretation clause.-In this Act the following words and expressions are used in the following
senses, unless a contrary intention appears from the context
'Proved'.-A fact is said to be proved when, after considering the matters before it, the court either
believes it to exist, or considers its existence so probable that a prudent man ought, under the
circumstances of the particular case, to act upon the supposition that it exists.
*
Substituted by Act 21 of 2000, section 92 and Sch.II-1(a), for "all documents produced for the
inspection of the court" (w.e.f. 17-10-2000).
'Disproved'.-A fact is said to be disproved when, after considering the matters before it, the court
either believes that it does not exist, or considers its non-existence so probable that a prudent man
ought, under the circumstances of the particular case, to act upon the supposition that it does not
exist.
'Not proved' fact is said not to be proved when it is neither proved nor disproved
4. 'May presume'.-Whenever it is provided by this Act that the court may presume a fact, it may
either regard such fact as proved, unless and until it is disproved, or may call for proof of it.
'Shall presume'.-Whenever it is directed by this Act that the court shall presume a fact, it shall
regard such fact as proved, unless and until it is disproved.
'Conclusive proof'.-w one fact is declared by this Act to be conclusive proof of another, the
court shall, on proof of the one fact, regard the other as proved, and shall not allow evidence to be
given for the purpose of disproving it."
As aforementioned, standard of proof varies depending on the nature of proceedings. In civil
actions, it can be preponderance of probability but in criminal actions, unless the law provides to
the contrary, the onus is on the prosecution to establish the allegations and facts in issue beyond
reasonable doubt. Furthermore, the burden or onus of establishing the facts in issue, keeps on
shifting and is on the party who asserts a particular fact.
95. Indeed, in a criminal trial, the principle of innocence of the accused/ offender is regarded as
a human right-as held by this court in Narendra Singh V. State of M. P.* However, that
presumption can be interdicted by a law made by the Parliament/Legislature. It is well-settled that
statutory provisions regarding presumptions are nothing but rule of evidence. As observed by this
court in State of West Bengal V. Mir Mohammad Omar**, the pristine rule that the burden of proof
is on the prosecution to prove the guilt of the accused should not be taken as a fossilised doctrine
as though it admits no process of intelligent reasoning. The court went on to observe that the
doctrine of presumption is not alien to such a rule, nor would it impair the temper of the rule. On
the other hand, if the traditional Rule relating to burden of proof of the prosecution is allowed to be
wrapped in pedantic coverage, the offenders in serious offences would be the major beneficiaries
and the society would be the casualty. This observation has
been quoted with approval in Sucha Singh (supra). In the latter judgment, the court relying upon
other decisions including in Shambu Nath Mehra V. State of Ajmer*, noted that the provisions, such
as section 106** of the Evidence Act, is not intended to relieve the prosecution of its burden to
prove the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt, but the section would apply to cases
where the prosecution has succeeded in proving facts for which a reasonable inference can be
drawn regarding the existence of certain other facts, unless the accused by virtue of special
knowledge regarding such facts failed to offer any explanation which might drive the court to draw
a different inference. The court quoted with approval paragraph 33 of the decision in Shambu Nath
Mehra (supra), which reads thus :
"33. Presumption of fact is an inference as to the existence of one fact from the existence of some
other facts, unless the truth of such inference is disproved. Presumption of fact is a rule in law of
evidence that a fact otherwise doubtful may be inferred from certain other proved facts. When
inferring the existence of a fact from other set of proved facts, the court exercises a process of
reasoning and reaches a logical conclusion as the most probable position. The above principle has
gained legislative recognition in India when section 114 is incorporated in the Evidence Act. It
empowers the court to presume the existence of any fact which it thinks likely to have happened.
In that process the court shall have regard to the common course of natural events, human
conduct, etc. in relation to the facts of the case." (emphasis supplied)
On similar lines, this court in Hiten P. Dalal (supra), in paragraphs 22 and 23 observed thus :
"22. Because both sections 138 and 139 require that the court "shall presume" the liability of the
drawer of the cheques for the amounts for which the cheques are drawn, as noted in State of
Madras V. A. Vaidyanatha Iyer it is obligatory on the court to raise this presumption in every case
where the factual basis for the raising of the presumption had been established. "It introduces an
exception to the general rule as to the burden of proof in criminal cases and shifts the onus on to
the accused." (Ibid. at p. 65, para 14.) Such a presumption is a presumption of law, as
distinguished from a pre
* AIR 1956 SC 404.
106. Burden of proving fact especially within knowledge.-When any fact is especially within the
knowledge of any person, the burden of proving that fact is upon him.
AIR 1958 SC 61.
sumption of fact which describes provisions by which the court "may presume" a certain state of
affairs. Presumptions are rules of evidence and do not conflict with the presumption of innocence,
because by the latter, all that is meant is that the prosecution is obliged to prove the case against
the accused beyond reasonable doubt. The obligation on the prosecution may be discharged with
the help of presumptions of law or fact unless the accused adduces evidence showing the
reasonable possibility of the non-existence of the presumed fact.
23. In other words, provided the facts required to form the basis of a presumption of law exist, no
discretion is left with the court but to draw the statutory conclusion, but this does not preclude the
person against whom the presumption is drawn from rebutting it and proving the contrary. A fact is
said to be proved when,
'after considering the matters before it, the court either believes it to exist, or considers its
existence so probable that a prudent man ought, under the circumstances of the particular case, to
act upon the supposition that it exists'*.
Therefore, the rebuttal does not have to be conclusively established but such evidence must be
adduced before the court in support of the defence that the court must either believe the defence
to exist or consider its existence to be reasonably probable, the standard of reasonability being that
of the 'prudent man'." (emphasis supplied)
The respondents have rightly invited our attention to several other statutes** providing for shifting
of the burden of proof on the accused, as in the case of section 24 of the 2002 Act. The
constitutional validity of similar provisions has been upheld by this court from time to time. In the
case of Noor Aga (supra), it has been observed that the court while interpreting the provision, such
as section 24 of the 2002 Act, must keep in mind that the concerned Act has been the outcome of
the mandate contained in the inter
* Section 3, Evidence Act.

national convention, as is the case on hand. Further, only because the burden of proof under certain
circumstances is placed on the accused, the same, by itself would not render the legal provision
unconstitutional. The question whether the burden on the accused is a legal burden or an
evidentiary burden, would depend on the statute and its purport and object. Indeed, it must pass
the test of the doctrine of proportionality. In any case, as the burden on the accused would be only
an evidentiary burden, it can be discharged by the accused by producing evidence regarding the
facts within his personal knowledge. Again, in the case of Seema Silk and Sarees (supra), this court
restated that a legal provision does not become unconstitutional only because it provides for
reverse burden as it is only a rule of evidence. So long as the accused is entitled to show that he
has not violated the provisions of the Act, such a legal provision cannot be regarded as
unconstitutional. For, the accused is then entitled to rebut the presumption.
96. Suffice it to observe that the change effected in section 24 of the 2002 Act is the outcome of
the mandate of international Conventions and recommendations made in that regard. Further,
keeping in mind the legislative scheme and the purposes and objects sought to be achieved by the
2002 Act coupled with the fact that the person charged or any other person involved in money-
laundering, would get opportunity to disclose information and evidence to rebut the legal
presumption in respect of facts within his personal knowledge during the proceeding before the
Authority or the Special Court, by no stretch of imagination, provision in the form of section 24 of
the 2002 Act, can be regarded as unconstitutional. It has reasonable nexus with the purposes and
objects sought to be achieved by the 2002 Act. In any case, it cannot be perceived as manifestly
arbitrary as is sought to be urged before us.
97. Be that as it may, we may now proceed to decipher the purport of section 24 of the 2002
Act. In the first place, it must be noticed that the legal presumption in either case is about the
involvement of proceeds of crime in money-laundering. This fact becomes relevant, only if, the
prosecution or the authorities have succeeded in establishing at least three basic or foundational
facts. First, that the criminal activity relating to a scheduled offence has been committed. Second,
that the property in question has been derived or obtained, directly or indirectly, by any person as
a result of that criminal activity. Third, the person concerned is, directly or indirectly, involved in
any process or activity connected with the said property being proceeds of crime. On establishing
the fact that there existed proceeds of crime and the person concerned was involved in any process
or activity connected therewith, itself, constitutes offence of money-laundering. The nature of
process or activity has now been elaborated in the form of Explanation inserted vide Finance (No.
2) Act, 2019. On establishing these foundational facts in terms of section 24 of the 2002 Act, a
legal presumption would arise that such proceeds of crime are involved in money-laundering. The
fact that the person concerned had no causal connection with such proceeds of crime and he is able
to disprove the fact about his involvement in any process or activity connected therewith, by
producing evidence in that regard, the legal presumption would stand rebutted.
98. The person falling under the first category being person charged with the offence of money-
laundering, presupposes that a formal complaint has already been filed against him by the
authority authorised naming him as an accused in the commission of offence of money-laundering.
As observed in P. N. Krishna Lal (supra), the court cannot be oblivious about the purpose of the
law. Further, the special provisions or the special enactments as in this case is required to tackle
new situations created by human proclivity to amass wealth at the altar of formal financial system
of the country including its sovereignty and integrity. While dealing with such provision, reading it
down would also defeat the legislative intent.
99. Be it noted that the legal presumption under section 24(a) of the 2002 Act, would apply
when the person is charged with the offence of money- laundering and his direct or indirect
involvement in any process or activity connected with the proceeds of crime, is established. The
existence of proceeds of crime is, therefore, a foundational fact, to be established by the
prosecution, including the involvement of the person in any process or activity connected therewith.
Once these foundational facts are established by the prosecution, the onus must then shift on the
person facing charge of offence of money-laundering-to rebut the legal presumption that the
proceeds of crime are not involved in money-laundering, by producing evidence which is within his
personal knowledge. In other words, the expression "presume" is not conclusive. It also does not
follow that the legal presumption that the proceeds of crime are involved in money-laundering is to
be invoked by the Authority or the court, without providing an opportunity to the person to rebut
the same by leading evidence within his personal knowledge*.
100. Such onus also flows from the purport of section 106 of the Evidence Act. Whereby, he
must rebut the legal presumption in the manner he chooses to do and as is permissible in law,
including by replying under section 313 of the 1973 Code or even by cross-examining prosecution
witnesses. The person would get enough opportunity in the proceeding before
the Authority or the court, as the case may be. He may be able to discharge his burden by showing
that he is not involved in any process or activity connected with the proceeds of crime. In any case,
in terms of section 114* of the Evidence Act, it is open to the court to presume the existence of any
fact which it thinks likely to have happened, regard being had to the common course of natural
events, human conduct, and public and private business, in their relation to the facts of the
particular case. Considering the above, the provision under consideration [section 24(a)] by no
standards can be said to be unreasonable much less manifestly arbitrary and unconstitutional.
101. Reverting to section 24(b) of the 2002 Act, that concerns person other than the person
charged with the offence of money-laundering under section 3 of the 2002 Act. In his case, the
expression used in clause (b) is "may presume". This is essentially a factual presumption or
discretionary presumption as expounded by this court in A. Vaidyanatha Iyer (supra). In paragraph
14 of the decision, the court noted the marked distinction between the words "shall presume" and
"may presume" as follows :
"(14).
Therefore where it is proved that a gratification has been accepted, then the presumption
shall at once arise under the section. It introduces an exception to the general rule as to the burden
of proof in criminal cases and shifts the onus on to the accused. It may here be mentioned that the
legislature has chosen to use the words 'shall presume" and not 'may presume', the former a
presumption of law and latter of fact. Both these phrases have been defined in the Indian Evidence
Act, no doubt for the purpose of that Act, but section 4 of the Prevention of Corruption Act is in pari
materia with the Evidence Act because it deals with a branch of law of evidence, e.g.,
presumptions, and therefore should have the same meaning. 'Shall presume" has been defined in
the Evidence Act as follows :
'Whenever it is directed by this Act that the court shall presume a fact, it shall regard such fact as
proved unless and until it is disproved."
It is a presumption of law and therefore it is obligatory on the court to raise this presumption in
every case brought under section 4 of the Prevention of Corruption Act because unlike the case of
presumption
* 114. Court may presume existence of certain facts. The court may presume the existence ofany
fact which it thinks likely to have happened, regard being had to the common courseof natural
events, human conduct and public and private business, in their relation to thefacts of the
particular case.
of fact, presumptions of law constitute a branch of jurisprudence. " (emphasis supplied)
Again, in the case of M. Narsinga Rao V. State of A. P.* the court observed in paragraphs 13 and
17 as follows :
"13. Before proceeding further, we may point out that the expressions 'may presume' and 'shall
presume' are defined in section 4 of the Evidence Act. The presumptions falling under the former
category are compendiously known as 'factual presumptions' or 'discretionary presumptions" and
those falling under the latter as 'legal presumptions" or 'compulsory presumptions'. When the
expression 'shall be presumed' is employed in section 20(1) of the Act it must have the same
import of compulsion.
17. Presumption is an inference of a certain fact drawn from other proved facts. While inferring the
existence of a fact from another, the court is only applying a process of intelligent reasoning which
the mind of a prudent man would do under similar circumstances. Presumption is not the final
conclusion to be drawn from other facts. But it could as well be final if it remains undisturbed later.
Presumption in law of evidence is a rule indicating the stage of shifting the burden of proof. From a
certain fact or facts the court can draw an inference and that would remain until such inference is
either disproved or dispelled." (emphasis supplied)
Notably, the legal presumption in the context of section 24(b) of the 2002 Act is attracted once the
foundational fact of existence of proceeds of crime and the link of such person therewith in the
process or activity is established by the prosecution. The stated legal presumption can be invoked
in the proceeding before the Adjudicating Authority or the court, as the case may be. The legal
presumption is about the fact that the proceeds of crime are involved in money-laundering which,
however, can be rebutted by the person by producing evidence within his personal knowledge.
102. Be it noted that the presumption under section 24(b) of the 2002 Act is not a mandatory
legal presumption, unlike in the case falling under the other category, namely section 24(a). If the
person has not been charged with the offence of money-laundering, the legal presumption under
section 24(b) can be invoked by the Adjudicating Authority or the court, as the case may be. More
or less, same logic as already noted while dealing with the efficacy of section 24(a) of the 2002 Act,
would apply even to the category of person covered by section 24(b), in equal measure.
103. We, therefore, hold that the provision under consideration namely section 24 has
reasonable nexus with the purposes and objects sought to be achieved by the 2002 Act and cannot
be regarded as manifestly arbitrary or unconstitutional.
Special Courts
104. The expression "Special Court" has been defined in section 2(1)(z), which in turn refers to
section 43. Section 43 reads thus
"Chapter VII
Special Courts
43. Special Courts.-(1) The Central Government, in consultation with the Chief Justice of the High
Court, shall, for trial of offence punishable under section 4, by notification, designate one or more
courts of Session as Special Court or Special Courts for such area or areas or for such case or class
or group of cases as may be specified in the notification.
Explanation.-In this sub-section, 'High Court' means the High Court of the State in which a
Sessions Court designated as Special Court was functioning immediately before such designation.
(2) While trying an offence under this Act, a Special Court shall also try an offence, other than an
offence referred to in sub-section (1), with which the accused may, under the Code of Criminal
Procedure, 1973 (2 of 1974), be charged at the same trial."
The Special Courts established under section 43 of the 2002 Act are empowered to try the offences
under the 2002 Act. Section 44 bestows that power in the Special Courts. The same reads thus :
"44. Offences triable by Special Courts.-(1) Notwithstanding anything contained in the Code of
Criminal Procedure, 1973 (2 of 1974),-
*(a) an offence punishable under section 4 and any scheduled offence connected to the offence
under that section shall be triable by the Special Court constituted for the area in which the offence
has been committed :

dated 8-2-2013). Clause (a) before substitution, stood as under :"(a) the scheduled offence and
offence punishable under section 4 shall be triable onlyby the Special Court constituted for the area
in which the offence has been committed : Provided that the Special Court, trying a scheduled
offence before the commencement ofthis Act, shall continue to try such scheduled offence ; or"
Provided that the Special Court, trying a scheduled offence before the commencement of this Act,
shall continue to try such scheduled offence ; or
(b) a Special Court may, *[.. .] upon a complaint made by an authority authorised in this behalf
under this Act take **[cognizance of offence under section 3, without the accused being committed
to it for trial :
***Provided that after conclusion of investigation, if no offence of money-laundering is made out
requiring filing of such complaint, the said authority shall submit a closure report before the Special
Court ; or
#(c) if the court which has taken cognizance of the scheduled offence is other than the Special
Court which has taken cognizance of the complaint of the offence of money-laundering under sub-
clause (b), it shall, on an application by the authority authorised to file a complaint under this Act,
commit the case relating to the scheduled offence to the Special Court and the Special Court shall,
on receipt of such case proceed to deal with it from the stage at which it is committed.
(d) a Special Court while trying the scheduled offence or the offence of money-laundering shall hold
trial in accordance with the provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (2 of 1974) as it
applies to a trial before a court of Session.
##Explanation.-Fo the removal of doubts, it is clarified that,- -
(i) the jurisdiction of the Special Court while dealing with the offence under this Act, during
investigation, enquiry or trial under this Act, shall not be dependent upon any orders passed in
respect of the scheduled offence, and the trial of both sets of offences by the same court shall not
be construed as joint trial ;
(ii) the complaint shall be deemed to include any subsequent complaint in respect of further
investigation that may be conducted to bring any further evidence, oral or documentary, against
any accused

(2) Nothing contained in this section shall be deemed to affect the special powers of the High Court

Court may exercise such powers including the power under clause (b) of sub-section (1) of that
section as if the reference to "Magistrate" in that section includes also a reference to a "Special
Court" designated under section 43."
This provision opens with a non-obstante clause making it clear that the dispensation provided
therein is notwithstanding anything contained in the 1973 Code regarding the matters provided
therein in relation to trials concerning offence of money-laundering to be conducted by the Special
Court. This provision has undergone amendment vide Act 20 of 2005, Act 2 of 2013 and Finance
(No. 2) Act, 2019. In the present set of matters, we are essentially concerned with the provision as
obtaining after Act 2 of 2013 and the subsequent amendment vide the Finance (No. 2) Act, 2019.
To begin with, clause (a) in sub-section (1) of section 44, as existed prior to amendment Act 2 of
2013, stood thus :
"44. Offences triable by Special Courts.-(1) Notwithstanding anything contained in the Code of
Criminal Procedure, 1973 (2 of 1974),-
(a) the scheduled offence and offence punishable under section 4 shall be triable only by the
Special Court constituted for the area in which the offence has been committed
:
Provided that the Special Court, trying a scheduled offence before the commencement of this Act,
shall continue to try such scheduled offence ; or."
Post amendment of 2013 and as applicable to this date, clause (a) reads thus :
"44. Offences triable by Special Courts.-(1) Notwithstanding anything contained in the Code of
Criminal Procedure, 1973 (2 of 1974),-
*(a) an offence punishable under section 4 and any scheduled offence connected to the offence
under that section shall be triable by the Special Court constituted for the area in which the offence
has been committed :
* Substituted by Act 2 of 2013, section 21(i), for clause (a) (w.e.f. 15-2-2013, vide S. O. 343(E),
dated 8-2-2013).
Provided that the Special Court, trying a scheduled offence before the commencement of this Act,
shall continue to try such scheduled offence ; or"
The amendment of 2013 in fact clarifies the dispensation to be followed in regard to trials
concerning offence of money-laundering under this Act and the trial in relation to scheduled offence
including before the Special Court trying such (scheduled) offence. By virtue of this clause, the
trials regarding the offence of money-laundering need to proceed before the Special Court
constituted for the area in which the offence of money-laundering has been committed. In case the
scheduled offence is triable by Special Court under the special enactment elsewhere, the provision,
as amended, makes it amply clear that both the trials after coming into effect of this Act need to
proceed independently, but in the area where the offence of money-laundering has been
committed.
105. In that, the offence of money-laundering ought to proceed for trial only before the Special
Court designated to try money-laundering offences where the offence of money-laundering has
been committed. This is a special enactment and being a later law, would prevail over any other
law for the time being in force in terms of section 71 of the 2002 Act.
106. The proviso in clause (a) of sub-section (1) of section 44, is in the nature of an exception.
It predicates that before the commencement of this Act, if the Special Court elsewhere was already
trying the scheduled offence, shall continue to try the same. Prima facie, it is possible to take the
view that the effect of this proviso, which has come in 2013, may have retrospective effect.
However, no specific case has been brought to our notice wherein the effect of such amendment is
required to be examined. Accordingly, it is not necessary to dilate on this aspect any further.
107. This stipulation, however, will have to be regarded as directory provision. We say so
because in a given case, the offence of money-laundering may have been committed at place X,
which may be in one State, but the property which is subject matter of money-laundering may
have been derived or obtained, directly or indirectly, as a result of criminal activity relating to a
scheduled offence committed at more than one place including in multiple States throughout the
country. In such a case, it will not be open to the Special Court at place X to transfer all other cases
in the area (even outside the State). If the provision is to be interpreted otherwise, it would have
serious consequences on the trials which are pending in connection with the scheduled offences
including before the Special Court elsewhere. This provision, therefore, needs to be read down to
mean that as far as possible, the trial of scheduled offence before the Special Court under the
concerned law, if in different area, that Special Court may continue to try such scheduled offence.
For, the trial of the scheduled offence and the trial in connection with the money-laundering are in
any way required to proceed independently. That is because, the offence of money- laundering by
itself is an independent offence in respect of the process and activity connected with the proceeds
of crime which may have been derived or obtained, directly or indirectly, by any person as a result
of criminal activity relating to a scheduled offence.
108. The stipulation in clause (b) of sub-section (1) of section 44 has been amended vide Act 20
of 2005, Act 2 of 2013 and the Finance (No. 2) Act, 2019. Consequent to amendment of 2013, the
clause (b) read thus :
"44. Offences triable by Special Courts.-(1) Notwithstanding anything contained in the Code of
Criminal Procedure, 1973 (2 of 1974),
(b) a Special Court may, * .] upon a complaint made by an authority authorised in this behalf
under this Act take **cognizance of offence under section 3, without the accused being committed
to it for trial ;"
Later, a proviso came to be inserted vide Finance (No. 2) Act, 2019, which reads thus :
"44. Offences triable by Special Courts.-(1) Notwithstanding anything contained in the Code of
Criminal Procedure, 1973 (2 of 1974),-
**Provided that after conclusion of investigation, if no offence of money-laundering is made out
requiring filing of such complaint, the said authority shall submit a closure report before the Special
Court ; or"
Clause (b) of sub-section (1) of section 44 before amendment of 2019 envisaged that the Special
Court upon a complaint made by any authority authorised in this behalf under this Act, could take
cognizance of offence of money-laundering under section 3 of the 2002 Act without the accused
being committed to it for trial. This would mean that if the accused was already in custody and
facing trial in respect of a scheduled offence elsewhere and is not required to be produced before
the Special Court
* The words "upon perusal of police report of the facts which constitute an offence under this Act
or" omitted by Act 20 of 2005, section 6 (w.e.f. 1-7-2005).
Substituted by Act 2 of 2013, section 21(ii), for "cognizance of the offence for which theaccused

(PMLA) at the time of taking cognizance on the complaint filed by the authority authorised. This
provision again must be regarded as directory or a discretionary provision and the Special Court
trying the offence of money-laundering need not insist for producing the accused before it at the
time of taking cognizance of offence of money-laundering, provided no prejudice is caused to such
accused. The expression "committed" occurring in this clause can be also construed as "produced".
If so understood, we fail to comprehend as to how this provision violates any right of the accused,
much less constitutional rights.
109. Coming to the proviso inserted in this clause [section 44(1)(b)] vide Finance (No. 2) Act,
2019, is, in fact, an enabling provision. It permits the Authority authorised to file a closure report
before the Special Court in case it is of the opinion that no offence of money-laundering has been
made out, requiring filing of such complaint. This provision is only to dispel the doubt that in the
event the person has been arrested by the officer authorised under section 19 of this Act on the
basis of material in his possession and having reason to believe and recorded in writing of being
guilty of an offence punishable under this Act, but after the inquiry done by him in exercise of
powers under Chapters V and VIII of the 2002 Act, he forms an opinion that no offence of money-
laundering is made out, requiring filing of complaint, it is open to him to file a closure report before
the Special Court disclosing that position. The proviso would, thus, come into play in such cases
where the complaint is yet to be filed owing to the pendency of inquiry before the authorities,
under Chapters V and VIII of the 2002 Act. In that view of the matter and more so keeping in mind
the purposes and objects behind the enactment of 2002 Act, such a provision must be regarded as
having reasonable nexus with the purposes and objects sought to be achieved by the 2002 Act.
The surest way t legal research!"
Accordingly, for the view taken by us, we do not find any dichotomy in these provisions, much less
being manifestly arbitrary or unconstitutional.
110. We now revert to clause (c) of sub-section (1) of section 44 of the 2002 Act. The same has
undergone amendment vide Act 2 of 2013 and post that amendment, it reads thus :
"44. Offences triable by Special Courts.-(1) Notwithstanding anything contained in the Code of
Criminal Procedure, 1973 (2 of 1974),
*(c) if the court which has taken cognizance of the scheduled offence is other than the Special
Court which has taken cognizance of
*
Inserted by Act 2 of 2013, section 21(iii) (w.e.f. 15-2-2013, vide S. O. 343(E), dated 8-2-2013).
the complaint of the offence of money-laundering under sub-clause (b), it shall, on an application
by the authority authorised to file a complaint under this Act, commit the case relating to the
scheduled offence to the Special Court and the Special Court shall, on receipt of such case proceed
to deal with it from the stage at which it is committed."
We must reconcile this provision with clause (a) of sub-section (1) of section 44. That provision has
already been elaborated in the earlier part of this judgment and read down to mean that it is an
enabling and discretionary provision. The same consideration must be kept in mind by the Special
Court while considering the application filed in terms of this clause. For, this clause also recognises
that the trial of scheduled offence and the trial concerning offence of money-laundering need to
proceed independently, even though it may be tried by the same Special Court as both are distinct
and independent offences. In that, the offence of money-laundering is and can be only in relation
to the process or activity connected with proceeds of crime and has nothing to do with the criminal
activity relating to a scheduled offence as such.
111. In the context of this provision, it was emphatically argued before us by the petitioners
that it would take away one right of appeal, otherwise available under the 1973 Code. Resultantly,
section 44(1)(c) of the 2002 Act in particular, is unconstitutional. To buttress this submission,
reliance has been placed on the dictum in A. R. Antulay (supra). However, this ground need not
detain us in view of the just stand taken by the learned Additional Solicitor General appearing for
Union of India relying on the decision of this court in State V. Kalyan Singh*, which has considered
similar challenge. The latter decision has distinguished the exposition in A. R. Antulay (supra). In
that, the core issue considered in A. R. Antulay (supra) was whether the High Court was competent
to transfer the criminal trial pending before the Special Court dealing with the offence of PC Act, to
itself by invoking powers under section 407 of the 1973 Code. The court answered the same in the
negative and held that such power does not exist in the High Court and it would inevitably violate
article 21 of the Constitution. However, we are dealing with the dispensation provided by the law
made by the Parliament in the form of 2002 Act. This being a special legislation and keeping in
view the purport of sections 65 and 71 of the 2002 Act, it is not possible to countenance the
ground of challenge under consideration. We may usefully refer to paragraph 28 of Kalyan Singh
(supra), which reads thus :
"28. In the present case, the power of transfer is being exercised to transfer a case from one
Special Judge to another Special Judge, and not to the High Court. The fact that one Special
Judge happens to be a Magistrate, whereas the other Special Judge has committed the case to a
court of Session would not make any difference as, as has been stated hereinabove, even a right
of appeal from a Magistrate to the Sessions Court, and from the Sessions Court to the High Court
could be taken away under the procedure established by law, i. e., by virtue of section 407(1)
and (8) if the case is required to be transferred from the Magistrate at Rae Bareilly to the High
Court itself. Hence, under section 407, even if 2 tiers of appeal are done away with, there is no
infraction of article 21 as such taking away of the right of appeal is expressly contemplated by
section 407(1)(iv) read with section 407(8). In the circumstances, Antulay (supra) judgment
which dealt with the right of a substantive appeal from a Special Judge to the High Court being
taken away by an order of transfer contrary to the non-obstante clause in section 7(1) of the
Criminal Law Amendment Act, 1952 would not apply in the facts and circumstances before
The surest way t legal research!"
us." (emphasis supplied)
Applying the principle underlying this decision, we have no hesitation in rejecting the
challenge to section 44 as unconstitutional being violative of articles 14, 20(3) and 21 of the
Constitution.
112. Reverting to clause (d) of sub-section (1) of section 44, it postulates that a Special Court
while trying the scheduled offence or offence of money- laundering shall hold trial in accordance
with the provisions of the 1973 Code as it applies to a trial before a court of sessions. Going by the
plain language of this provision, no fault can be found for conducting trial in the respective cases in
the same manner as provided in the 1973 Code. However, the grievance is about the insertion of
Explanation vide Finance (No. 2) Act, 2019. As a matter of fact, this insertion is only a clarificatory
provision, as is evident from the opening statement of the provision which says that "for the
removal of doubts, it is clarified that". None of the clauses inserted by this amendment travel
beyond the principal provision contained in clause (d). Clause (i) of the Explanation enunciates that
the jurisdiction of the Special Court while dealing with the offence being tried under this Act, shall
not be dependent upon any orders passed in respect of the scheduled offence, and the trial of both
sets of offences by the same court shall not be construed as joint trials. This, in fact, is reiteration
of the earlier part of the same section, which envisages that even though both the trials may
proceed before the same Special Court, it must be tried separately as per the provisions of the
1973 Code. In so far as clause (ii) of the Explanation, at the first glance, it does give an impression
that the same is unconnected with the earlier part of the section. However, on closer scrutiny of
this provision, it is noted that the same is only an enabling provision permitting to take on record
material regarding further investigation against any accused person involved in respect of offence
of money-laundering for which complaint has already been filed, whether he has been named in the
complaint or not. Such a provision, in fact, is a wholesome provision to ensure that no person
involved in the commission of offence of money-laundering must go unpunished. It is always open
to the Authority authorised to seek permission of the court during the trial of the complaint in
respect of which cognizance has already been taken by the court to bring on record further
evidence which request can be dealt with by the Special Court in accordance with law keeping in
mind the provisions of the 1973 Code as well. It is also open to the Authority authorised to file a
fresh complaint against the person who has not been named as accused in the complaint already
filed in respect of same offence of money- laundering, including to request the court to proceed
against such other person appearing to be guilty of offence under section 319 of the 1973 Code,
which otherwise would apply to such a trial.
113. The petitioners may be justified in making grievance that the provision though permits the
Special Court to proceed with the trial in respect of scheduled offence, yet it may be oppressive as
against the accused who is not charged with the offence of money-laundering but only scheduled
offence. For, he may be denied of opportunity of one appeal or revision, as the case may be before
the higher forum. Such a grievance can certainly be looked into by the Special Court if an
application is moved by the Authority authorised. Since we have held that the provision is only to
bestow enabling power in the Special Court, it must follow that the Special Court will examine the
request of the Authority authorised for transfer of trial of predicate offence to itself on case-to-case
basis. Similarly, request for trial of offence under another special statute, such as the PC Act, NDPS
Act, etc., can also be considered by the Special Court on case-to-case basis after examining all
aspects of the matter.
114. In view of the above discussion, we do not find merit in the challenge to section 44 being
arbitrary or unconstitutional. We hold that the same is consistent with the legislative scheme and
the purposes and objects behind the enactment of the 2002 Act to ensure that the proceeds of
crime involved in money-laundering are dealt with appropriately as per the special Act and all
concerned involved in the process or activity connected with such proceeds of crime are prosecuted
for offence of money-laundering.
Bail
115. The relevant provisions regarding bail in the 2002 Act can be traced to sections 44(2), 45
and 46 in Chapter VII concerning the offence under this Act. The principal grievance is about the
twin conditions specified in section 45 of the 2002 Act. Before we elaborate further, it would be
apposite to reproduce section 45, as amended. The same reads thus :
"45. Offences to be cognizable and non-bailable.-(1) *Notwithstanding anything contained in
the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (2 of 1974), no person accused of an offence **under this
Act shall be released on bail or on his own bond unless-
(i) the Public Prosecutor has been given an opportunity to oppose the application for such
release and
(ii) where the Public Prosecutor opposes the application, the court is satisfied that there are
reasonable grounds for believing that he is not guilty of such offence and that he is not likely
to commit any offence while on bail :
Provided that a person who is under the age of sixteen years, or is a woman or is sick or
infirm, or is accused either on his own or along with other co-accused of money-laundering a
sum of less than one crore rupees, may be released on bail, if the Special Court so directs :
Provided further that the Special Court shall not take cognizance of any offence punishable
under section 4 except upon a complaint in writing made by-
(i) the Director ; or
* Substituted by Act 20 of 2005, section 7, for "Notwithstanding anything contained in the Code of

than three years under Part A of the Schedule shall be released on bail or on his own bond
unless" (with effect from 1-7-2005).
Substituted by Act 13 of 2018, section 208(e)(i), for "punishable for a term of imprisonment of
more than three years under Part A of the Schedule" (with effect from 19-4-2018, vide G.S.R. 383
(E), dated 19th April, 2018).

this behalf by the Central Government by a general or special order made in this behalf by
that Government.
*(1A) Notwithstanding anything contained in the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (2 of

and, subject to such conditions as may be prescribed.

***Explanation.-For the removal of doubts, it is clarified that the expression "Offences to be
cognizable and non-bailable" shall mean and shall be deemed to have always meant that all
offences under this Act shall be cognizable offences and non-bailable offences notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (2 of 1974), and
accordingly the officers authorised under this Act are empowered to arrest an accused without
warrant, subject to the fulfilment of conditions under section 19 and subject to the conditions
enshrined under this section."
Section 45 has been amended vide Act 20 of 2005, Act 13 of 2018 and Finance (No. 2) Act,
2019. The provision as it obtained prior to November 23, 2017 read somewhat differently. The
constitutional validity of sub-section (1) of section 45, as it stood then, was considered in Nikesh
Tarachand Shah (supra). This court declared section 45(1) of the 2002 Act, as it stood then, in
so far as it imposed two further conditions for release on bail, to be unconstitutional being
violative of articles 14 and 21 of the Constitution. The two conditions which have been
mentioned as twin conditions are :
(i) that there are reasonable grounds for believing that he is not guilty of such offence ; and
(ii) that he is not likely to commit any offence while on bail.
According to the petitioners, since the twin conditions have been declared to be void and
unconstitutional by this court, the same stood obliterated. To buttress this argument, reliance
has been placed on the dictum in State of Manipur (supra).
* Inserted by Act 20 of 2005, section 7 (with effect from 1-7-2005).
The words "clause (b) of" omitted by Act 20 of 2005, section 7 (with effect from 1-7-2005).
Inserted by the Finance (No. 2) Act, 2019, section 200 (with effect from 1-8-2019).
116. The first issue to be answered by us is: whether the twin conditions, in law, continued to
remain on the statute book post decision of this court in Nikesh Tarachand Shah (supra) and if yes,
in view of the amendment effected to section 45(1) of the 2002 Act vide Act 13 of 2018, the
declaration by this court will be of no consequence. This argument need not detain us for long. We
say so because the observation in State of Manipur (supra) in paragraph 29 of the judgment that
owing to the declaration by a court that the statute is unconstitutional obliterates the statute
entirely as though it had never been passed, is contextual. In this case, the court was dealing with
the efficacy of the repealing Act. While doing so, the court had adverted to the repealing Act and
made the stated observation in the context of lack of legislative power. In the process of reasoning,
it did advert to the exposition in Behram Khurshid Pesikaka (supra) and Deep Chand (supra)
including American jurisprudence expounded in Cooley on Constitutional Limitations* and Norton V.
Shelby County**
117. In the present case, however, there is no issue of lack of legislative power of Parliament to
enact a law on the subject of money-laundering. In such a situation, the enunciation of the
Constitution Bench of this court, including seven-judge Bench, may have direct bearing for
answering the argument under consideration. We may usefully refer to the dictum of the
Constitution Bench of five-judges of this court in M. P. V. Sundararamien and Co. (supra). It had
noted the distinction between the effect of unconstitutionality of a statute arising either because
the law is in respect of a matter not within the competence of the Legislature, or because the
matter itself being within its competence, its provisions offend some constitutional restrictions. It
went on to observe that if a law is on a field not within the domain of the Legislature, it is
absolutely null and void, and a subsequent cession of that field to or by the Legislature will not
have the effect of breathing life into what was a still born piece of legislation. At the same time, it
noted that if the law is in respect of a matter assigned to the Legislature but its provisions
disregard constitutional prohibitions, though the law would be unenforceable by reason of those
prohibitions, when once they are removed, the law will become effective without re-enactment.
After discussing the American decisions and jurisprudence, it went on to sum up as follows :
"The result of the authorities may thus be summed up : Where an enactment is
unconstitutional in part but valid as to the rest, assuming of course that the two portions are
severable, it cannot be held to
Volume 1, page 382.
118 US 425 (1886).
have been wiped out of the statute book as it admittedly must remain there for the purpose of
enforcement of the valid portion thereof, and being on the statute book, even that portion which
is unenforceable on the ground that it is unconstitutional will operate Proprio vigore when the
Constitutional bar is removed, and there is no need for a fresh legislation to give effect thereto.
On this view, the contention of the petitioners with reference to the Explanation in section 22 of
the Madras Act must fail. That Explanation operates, as already stated, on two classes of
transactions. It renders taxation of sales in which the property in the goods passes in Madras but
delivery takes place outside Madras illegal on the ground that they are outside sales falling
within article 286(1)(a). It also authorises the imposition of tax on the sales in which the
property in the goods passes outside Madras but goods are delivered for consumption within
Madras. It is valid in so far as it prohibits tax on outside sales, but invalid in so far as sales in
which goods are delivered inside the State are concerned, because such sales are hit by article
286(2). The fact that it is invalid as to a part has not the effect of obliterating it out of the
statute book, because it is valid as to a part and has to remain in the statute book for being
enforced as to that part. The result of the enactment of the impugned Act is to lift the ban under
article 286(2), and the consequence of it is that that portion of the Explanation which relates to
sales in which property passes outside Madras but the goods are delivered inside Madras and
which was unenforceable before, became valid and enforceable. In this view, we do not feel
called upon to express any opinion as to whether it would make any difference in the result if the
impugned provision was unconstitutional in its entirety." (emphasis supplied)
118. No doubt Deep Chand (supra) is a subsequent judgment as has been noticed in the State
of Manipur (supra). However, in the later judgment of the Constitution Bench of seven-judges of
this court in Jagannath (supra), the legal position has been reviewed and answered. This decision
has not only adverted to two earlier Constitution Bench decisions referred to and relied upon in
State of Manipur (i. e., Behram Khurshid Pesikaka (supra) and Deep Chand (supra)), including
American jurisprudence and decision in Norton (supra), but to hosts of other decisions. The first
point noted in paragraph 9 of this decision is that when this court has declared the concerned
legislation void under the provisions of article 13 sub-clause (2) of the Constitution, should the
court proceed on the basis that the legislation was void ab initio and non est or still born and, thus,
any validating measure could not instil life therein. After having analysed all the relevant decisions,
the court went on to observe in paragraphs 22 and 23, as follows
:
"22. In our view, although decisions of the American Supreme Court and the comments of
well known commentators like Willoughby and Cooley have great persuasive force, we need not
interpret our Constitution by too much reliance on them. Nor is it necessary to scrutinise too
closely the decisions wherein views appear to have been expressed that a law which is void
under article 13(2) is to be treated as still-born. Equally unfruitful would it be to consider the
doctrine of eclipse.
23. Apart from the question as to whether fundamental rights originally enshrined in the
Constitution were subject to the amendatory process of article 368 it must now be held that
article 31-B and the Ninth Schedule have cured the defect, if any, in the various Acts mentioned
in the said Schedule as regards any unconstitutionality alleged on the ground of infringement of
fundamental rights, and by the express words of article 31B such curing of the defect took place
with retrospective operation from the dates on which the Acts were put on the statute book.
These Acts even if void or inoperative at the time when they were enacted by reason of
infringement of article 13(2) of the Constitution, assumed full force and vigour from the
respective dates of their enactment after their inclusion in the Ninth Schedule, read with article
31B of the Constitution. The States could not, at any time, cure any defect arising from the
violation of the provisions of Part III of the Constitution and therefore the objection that the
Madras Ceilings Act should have been re-enacted by the Madras Legislature after the
Seventeenth Constitutional Amendment came into force cannot be accepted." (emphasis
supplied)
Thus, where the defect as pointed out by the court has been removed by virtue of the
validating Act retrospectively, then the provision can be held to be intra vires provided that it
does not transgress any other constitutional limitation. It is, therefore, clear from above that if
by amending the provision retrospectively, Parliament has removed the defect or has taken away
the basis on which the provision was declared void then the provision cannot be said to be in
conflict with article 13 of the Constitution. In other words, if the very premise on which the
judgment of the court declaring the provision to be void has been uprooted by Parliament,
thereby resulting in the change of circumstances, the judgment could not
be given effect to in the altered circumstances, then the provision cannot be held to be void.
In this case, as has been stated above, the anomalies noted in Nikesh Tarachand Shah (supra)
have been removed by way of Act No. 13 of 2018. Further, it has been clarified by way of the
Finance (No. 2) Act, 2019 that amendment shall operate retrospectively. Thus, it cannot be said
that twin conditions under section 45 of the 2002 Act does not get revived.
119. A priori, it is not open to argue that section 45 of the 2002 Act post decision in Nikesh
Tarachand Shah (supra) stood obliterated from the statute book as such. Indubitably, it is not
unknown that even after declaration of unconstitutionality by the court owing to violation of rights
guaranteed under Part III of the Constitution, it is open to Parliament/Legislature to cure the defect
reckoned by the Constitutional Court in relation to the concerned provision whilst declaring it as
unconstitutional.
120. In the case of Nikesh Tarachand Shah (supra), as aforesaid, this court declared the twin
conditions in section 45(1) of the 2002 Act as unconstitutional being violative of articles 14 and 21
of the Constitution. That conclusion reached by this court is essentially on account of two basic
reasons. The first being that the provision, as it existed at the relevant time, was founded on a
classification based on sentencing of the scheduled offence and it had no nexus with objectives of
the 2002 Act ; and secondly, because the twin conditions were restricted only to a particular class
of offences within the 2002 Act, such as offences punishable for a term of imprisonment for more
than three years under Part A of the Schedule, and not to all the offences under the 2002 Act. In
paragraph 1 of the same decision, the court had noted that the challenge set forth in the writ
petition was limited to imposing two conditions for grant of bail wherein an offence punishable for a
term of imprisonment for more than three years under part A of the Schedule to the Act is involved.
This aspect has been thoroughly analysed by the court in the said decision. The court also noted
the legislative history for enacting such a law and other relevant material from paragraph 11
onwards up to paragraph 43. It adverted to several circumstances and illustrations to conclude that
the provision, as it stood then, on the face of it, was discriminatory and manifestly arbitrary.
Eventually in the operative order, being paragraph 54 of the decision, the court declared that
section 45(1) of the 2002 Act, as it stood then, in so far as it imposes two further conditions for
release on bail, to be unconstitutional as it violated articles 14 and 21 of the Constitution.
121. By the amendment vide Act 13 of 2018, the defects noted by this court in the
aforementioned decision have been duly cured by deleting the words
"punishable for a term of imprisonment of more than three years under Part A of the Schedule" in
section 45(1) of the 2002 Act and substituted by words "under this Act". The question is : whether
it was open to Parliament to undo the effect of the judgment of this court declaring the twin
conditions unconstitutional ? On a fair reading of the judgment, we must observe that although the
court declared the twin conditions as unconstitutional, but it was in the context of the opening part
of sub-section (1) of section 45, as it stood then, which resulted in discrimination and arbitrariness
as noticed in the judgment. But that opening part referring to class of offences, namely, punishable
for a term of imprisonment of more than three years under Part A of the Schedule having been
deleted and, instead, the twin conditions have now been associated with all the offences under the
2002 Act, the defect pointed out in the stated decision, stands cured. To answer the question posed
above, we may also usefully refer to the enunciation of the Constitution Bench of this court, which
recognises power of the Legislature to cure the defect when the law is struck down by the
Constitutional Court as violative of some fundamental rights traceable to Part III of the
Constitution. It has been consistently held that such declaration does not have the effect of
repealing the relevant provision as such. For, the power to repeal vests only in Parliament and none
else. Only upon such repeal by Parliament, the provision would become non est for all purposes
until re-enacted, but it is open to Parliament to cure the defect noticed by the Constitutional Court
so that the provision, as amended by removing such defect gets revived. This is so because, the
declaration by the Constitutional Court and striking down of a legal provision being violative of
fundamental rights traceable to Part III of the Constitution, merely results in the provision, as it
existed then, becoming inoperative and unenforceable, even though it may continue to remain on
the statute book.
122. The decision of the Constitution Bench of this court in Shri Prithvi Cotton Mills Ltd. (supra)
recognises this doctrine of taking away as the basis or validating acts thereby removing the causes
for ineffectiveness or invalidity of actions or proceedings which are validated by a legislative
measure and, then by fiction, it becomes re-enacted law. We may usefully refer to the decision in
Bhubaneshwar Singh (supra), wherein in paragraph 11, the court noted as follows
"11. From time to time controversy has arisen as to whether the effect of judicial
pronouncements of the High Court or the Supreme Court can be wiped out by amending the
legislation with retrospective effect. Many such Amending Acts are called Validating Acts,
validating the action taken under the particular enactments by removing
the defect in the statute retrospectively because of which the statute or the part of it had
been declared ultra vires. Such exercise has been held by this court as not to amount to
encroachment on the judicial power of the courts. The exercise of rendering ineffective the
judgments or orders of competent courts by changing the very basis by legislation is a well-
known device of validating legislation. This court has repeatedly pointed out that such validating
legislation which removes the cause of the invalidity cannot be considered to be an
encroachment on judicial power. At the same time, any action in exercise of the power under any
enactment which has been declared to be invalid by a court cannot be made valid by a
Validating Act by merely saying so unless the defect which has been pointed out by the court is
removed with retrospective effect. The validating legislation must remove the cause of invalidity.
Till such defect or the lack of authority pointed out by the court under a statute is removed by
the subsequent enactment with retrospective effect, the binding nature of the judgment of the
court cannot be ignored." (emphasis supplied)
123. Again, in the case of Comorin Match Industries P. Ltd. (supra), this court after adverting to
earlier decisions, including Shri Prithvi Cotton Mills Ltd. (supra) observed in paragraph 24 as
follows* :
"24. This case does not lay down that after a judgment has been pronounced on the basis of
an Act, the provisions of that Act cannot be amended so as to cure the defect pointed out in the
judgment retrospectively. The effect of the amending Act of 1969 is not to overrule a judgment
passed by a court of law, which the legislature cannot do. What the Legislature can do is to
change the law on the basis of which the judgment was pronounced retrospectively and thereby
nullify the effect of the judgment. When the Legislature enacts that notwithstanding any
judgment or order the new law will operate retrospectively and the assessments shall be deemed
to be validly made on the basis of the amended law, the legislature is not declaring the
judgment to be void but rendering things or acts deemed to have been done under amended
statute valid notwithstanding any judgment or order on the basis of the unamended law to the
contrary. The validity to the assessment orders which had been struck down by the court, is
imparted by the amending Act by changing the law retrospectively." (emphasis1 supplied)
* Page 12 of 102 STC
124. The legal principles have been recapitulated by this court once again in Indian Aluminium
Co. (supra), in paragraph 56, it was observed as under :
"56. From a resume of the above decisions the following principles would emerge
(1) The adjudication of the rights of the parties is the essential judicial function. Legislature
has to lay down the norms of conduct or rules which will govern the parties and the
transactions and require the court to give effect to them ;
(2) The Constitution delineated delicate balance in the exercise of the sovereign power by
the Legislature, executive and judiciary ;
(3) In a democracy governed by rule of law, the legislature exercises the power under
articles 245 and 246 and other companion articles read with the entries in the respective lists
in the Seventh Schedule to make the law which includes power to amend the law ;
(4) Courts in their concern and endeavour to preserve judicial power equally must be
guarded to maintain the delicate balance devised by the Constitution between the three
sovereign functionaries. In order that rule of law permeates to fulfil constitutional objectives
of establishing an egalitarian social order, the respective sovereign functionaries need free
play in their joints so that the march of social progress and order remains unimpeded. The
smooth balance built with delicacy must always be maintained ;
(5) In its anxiety to safeguard judicial power, it is unnecessary to be overzealous and
conjure up incursion into the judicial preserve invalidating the valid law competently made
;
(6) The court, therefore, needs to carefully scan the law to find out : (a) whether the vice
pointed out by the court and invalidity suffered by previous law is cured complying with the
legal and constitutional requirements; (b) whether the Legislature has competence to validate
the law ; (c) whether such validation is consistent with the rights guaranteed in Part III of the
Constitution ;
(7) The court does not have the power to validate an invalid law or to legalise impost of tax
illegally made and collected or to remove the norm of invalidation or provide a remedy. These
are not judicial functions but the exclusive province of the Legislature. Therefore, they are not
encroachment on judicial power ;
(8) In exercising legislative power, the Legislature by mere declaration, without anything
more, cannot directly overrule, revise or override a judicial decision. It can render judicial
decision ineffective by enacting valid law on the topic within its legislative field fundamentally
altering or changing its character retrospectively. The
changed or altered conditions are such that the previous decision would not have been
rendered by the court, if those conditions had existed at the time of declaring the law as
invalid. It is also empowered to give effect to retrospective legislation with a deeming date or
with effect from a particular date. The Legislature can change the character of the tax or duty
from impermissible to permissible tax but the tax or levy should answer such character and
the Legislature is competent to recover the invalid tax validating such a tax on removing the
invalid base for recovery from the subject or render the recovery from the State ineffectual. It
is competent for the legislature to enact the law with retrospective effect and authorise its
agencies to levy and collect the tax on that basis, make the imposition of levy collected and
recovery of the tax made valid, notwithstanding the declaration by the court or the direction
given for recovery thereof
(9) The consistent thread that runs through all the decisions of this court is that the
Legislature cannot directly overrule the decision or make a direction as not binding on it but
has power to make the decision ineffective by removing the base on which the decision was
rendered, consistent with the law of the Constitution and the Legislature must have
competence to do the same." (emphasis supplied)
125. We may also usefully refer to the dictum in Narain Singh (supra), it was held as under
:
"21. The power of the sovereign legislature to legislate within its field, both prospectively and
retrospectively cannot be questioned. This position has been settled in many judgments of this
Court. Some of them may be considered below. In Bhubaneshwar Singh V. Union of India
(supra) the court expressly approved the aforesaid position in paragraph 9 at pages 82 and 83.
In so far as the validating Acts are concerned, this court in Bhubaneshwar Singh (supra) also
considered the question in paragraph 11 and held that the court has the powers by virtue of
such validating legislation, to 'wipe out' judicial pronouncements of the High Court and the
Supreme Court by removing the defects in the statute retrospectively when such statutes had
been declared ultra vires by courts in view of its defects.
22. This court in Bhubaneshwar Singh (supra) has held that such legislative exercise will not
amount to encroachment on the judicial power. This court has accepted that such legislative
device which removes the vice in previous legislation is not considered an encroachment on
judicial power. In support of the aforesaid proposition, this
court in Bhubaneshwar Singh (supra) relied on the proposition laid down by Hidayatullah, C.
J. speaking for the Constitution Bench in Shri Prithvi Cotton Mills Ltd. V. Broach Borough
Municipality (supra).
23. Again in Indian Aluminium Co. V. State of Kerala (supra) this court while summarising the
principle held that a Legislature cannot directly overrule a judicial decision but it has the power
to make the decision ineffective by removing the basis on which the decision is rendered, while
at the same time adhering to the constitutional imperatives and the Legislature is competent to
do so (see paragraph 56 sub-paragraph (9) at page 1446).
24. In Comorin Match Industries P. Ltd. V. State of Tamil Nadu (supra), the facts were that
the assessment orders passed under the Central Sales tax Act were set aside by the High Court
and the State was directed to refund the amount to the assessee. As the State failed to carry it
out, contempt petitions were filed but the assessment orders were validated by passing the
Amendment Act of 1969 with retrospective effect and the court held that the tax demanded
became valid and enforceable.
25. The court in Comorin Match case (supra) held that in such a situation the State will not be
precluded from realising the tax due as subsequently the assessment order was validated by the
amending Act of 1969 and the order passed in the contempt proceeding will not have the effect
of the writing off the debt which is statutorily owed by the assessee to the State. The learned
Judges held that the effect of the amending Act is retrospective validation of the assessment
orders which were struck down by the High Court. Therefore, the assessment order is
legislatively valid and the tax demands are also enforceable.
26. It is therefore clear where there is a competent legislative provision which retrospectively
removes the substratum of foundation of a judgment, the said exercise is a valid legislative
exercise provided it does not transgress any other constitutional limitation. Therefore, this court
cannot uphold the reasoning in the High Court judgment that the impugned amendment is
invalid just because it nullifies some provisions of the earlier Act." (emphasis supplied)
There are long line of decisions restating the above position and the recent being Cheviti
Venkanna Yadav (supra), which after analysing all the relevant authorities on the point, noted in
paragraph 30 as follows
"30. From the aforesaid authorities, it is settled that there is a demarcation between the
legislative and judicial functions predicated on the theory of separation of powers. The
Legislature has the power to enact laws including the power to retrospectively amend laws and
thereby remove causes of ineffectiveness or invalidity. When a law is enacted with retrospective
effect, it is not considered as an encroachment upon judicial power when the Legislature does
not directly overrule or reverse a judicial dictum. The Legislature cannot, by way of an
enactment, declare a decision of the court as erroneous or a nullity, but can amend the statute
or the provision so as to make it applicable to the past. The Legislature has the power to rectify,
through an amendment, a defect in law noticed in the enactment and even highlighted in the
decision of the court. This plenary power to bring the statute in conformity with the legislative
intent and correct the flaw pointed out by the court, can have a curative and neutralising effect.
When such a correction is made, the purpose behind the same is not to overrule the decision of
the court or encroach upon the judicial turf, but simply enact a fresh law with retrospective
effect to alter the foundation and meaning of the legislation and to remove the base on which
the judgment is founded. This does not amount to statutory overruling by the Legislature. In this
manner, the earlier decision of the court becomes non-existent and unenforceable for
interpretation of the new legislation. No doubt, the new legislation can be tested and challenged
on its own merits and on the question whether the legislature possesses the competence to
legislate on the subject-matter in question, but not on the ground of overreach or colourable
legislation." (emphasis supplied)
From the above discussion, it is amply clear that the twin conditions declared as
unconstitutional by this court in Nikesh Tarachand Shah (supra) was in reference to the
provision, as it existed at the relevant time, predicating application of section 45 of the 2002 Act
to only offences punishable for a term of imprisonment of more than three years under Part A of
the schedule of the 2002 Act and not even linked to the offences of money-laundering under the
2002 Act. The reasons which weighed with this court for declaring the twin conditions in section
45(1), as it stood at the relevant time, unconstitutional in no way obliterated the provision from
the statute book. Therefore, it was open to Parliament to cure the defect noted by this court and
to revive the same provision as in the present form, post amendment Act 13 of 2018 with effect
from April 19, 2018.
126. Having said thus, we must now address the challenge to the twin conditions as applicable
post amendment of 2018. That challenge will have to be tested on its own merits and not in
reference to the reasons weighed with this court in declaring the provision, (as it existed at the
relevant time), applicable only to offences punishable for a term of imprisonment of more than
three years under Part A of the Schedule to the 2002 Act. Now, the provision (section 45) including
The surest way t legal research!"
twin conditions would apply to the offence(s) under the 2002 Act itself. The provision post 2018
amendment, is in the nature of no bail in relation to the offence of money-laundering unless the
twin conditions are fulfilled. The twin conditions are that there are reasonable grounds for believing
that the accused is not guilty of offence of money-laundering and that he is not likely to commit
any offence while on bail. Considering the purposes and objects of the legislation in the form of
2002 Act and the background in which it had been enacted owing to the commitment made to the
international bodies and on their recommendations, it is plainly clear that it is a special legislation
to deal with the subject of money-laundering activities having transnational impact on the financial
systems including sovereignty and integrity of the countries. This is not an ordinary offence. To deal
with such serious offence, stringent measures are provided in the 2002 Act for prevention of money
-laundering and combating menace of money-laundering, including for attachment and confiscation
of proceeds of crime and to prosecute persons involved in the process or activity connected with the
proceeds of crime. In view of the gravity of the fallout of money-laundering activities having
transnational impact, a special procedural law for prevention and regulation, including to prosecute
the person involved, has been enacted, grouping the offenders involved in the process or activity
connected with the proceeds of crime as a separate class from ordinary criminals. The offence of
money-laundering has been regarded as an aggravated form of crime "world over". It is, therefore,
a separate class of offence requiring effective and stringent measures to combat the menace of
money-laundering.
127. There is no challenge to the provision on the ground of legislative competence. The
question, therefore, is : whether such classification of offenders involved in the offence of money-
laundering is reasonable ? Considering the concern expressed by the international community
regarding the money-laundering activities world over and the transnational impact thereof, coupled
with the fact that the presumption that Parliament understands and reacts to the needs of its own
people as per the exigency and experience gained in the implementation of the law, the same must
stand the test of fairness, reasonableness and having nexus with the purposes and objects sought
to be achieved by the 2002 Act. Notably, there are several other legislations where such twin
conditions have been provided for*. Such twin conditions in the concerned provisions have been
tested from time-to-time and have stood the challenge of the constitutional validity thereof. The
successive decisions of this court dealing with analogous provision have stated that the court at the
stage of considering the application for grant of bail, is expected to consider the question from the
angle as to whether the accused was possessed of the requisite mens rea. The court is not required
to record a positive finding that the accused had not committed an offence under the Act. The court
ought to maintain a delicate balance between a judgment of acquittal and conviction and an order
granting bail much before commencement of trial. The duty of the court at this stage is not to
weigh the evidence meticulously but to arrive at a finding on the basis of broad probabilities.
Further, the court is required to record a finding as to the possibility of the accused committing a
crime which is an offence under the Act after grant of bail.
128. For understanding whether such twin conditions can be regarded as reasonable condition,
we may usefully refer to the decision of the Constitution Bench of this court in Kartar Singh
(supra). While dealing with the challenge to section 20(8) of the TADA Act, the court rejected the
argument that such provision results in deprivation of liberty and violates articles 14 and 21 of the
Constitution. It noted that such provision imposes complete ban on release of accused on bail
involved in the stated offence under the special legislation, but that ban stands diluted by virtue of
twin conditions. It noted that rest of the provision, as in the case of section 45 of the 2002 Act, is
comparable with the conditions specified in the 1973 Code

for release of accused on bail concerning ordinary offence under general law. The Constitution
Bench approved the dictum in Usmanbhai Dawoodbhai Memon (supra) and in paragraph 349 noted
thus :
"349. The conditions imposed under section 20(8)(b), as rightly pointed out by the Additional
Solicitor General, are in consonance with the conditions prescribed under clauses (i) and (ii) of
sub-section (1) of section 437 and clause (b) of sub-section (3) of that section. Similar to the
conditions in clause (b) of sub-section (8), there are provisions in various other enactments-
such as section 35(1) of the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act and section 104(1) of the Customs
Act to the effect that any authorised or empowered officer under the respective Acts, if, has got
reason to believe that any person in India or within the Indian customs waters has been guilty of
an offence punishable under the respective Acts, may arrest such person. Therefore, the
condition that 'there are grounds for believing that he is not guilty of an offence', which
condition in different form is incorporated in other Acts such as clause (i) of section 437(1) of
the Code and section 35(1) of the FERA and section 104(1) of the Customs Act, cannot be said
to be an unreasonable condition infringing the principle of article 21 of the
Constitution." (emphasis supplied)
Again, in paragraph 351, the Constitution Bench observed thus:
"351. No doubt, liberty of a citizen must be zealously safeguarded by the courts ; nonetheless
the courts while dispensing justice in cases like the one under the TADA Act, should keep in
mind not only the liberty of the accused but also the interest of the victim and their near and
dear and above all the collective interest of the community and the safety of the nation so that
the public may not lose faith in the system of judicial administration and indulge in private
retribution." (emphasis1 supplied)
We may immediately note that this judgment has been considered by the two-judge Bench of
this court in Nikesh Tarachand Shah (supra) in paragraph 47 and distinguished in the following
words
"47.
It is clear that this court upheld such a condition only because the offence under TADA
was a most heinous offence in which the vice of terrorism is sought to be tackled. Given the
heinous nature of the offence which is punishable by death or life imprisonment, and given the
fact that the Special Court in that case was a Magistrate and not a Sessions Court, unlike the
present case, section
20(8) of TADA was upheld as being in consonance with conditions prescribed under section
437 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. In the present case, it is section 439 and not section 437
of the Code of Criminal Procedure that applies. Also, the offence that is spoken of in section 20
(8) is an offence under the TADA itself and not an offence under some other Act. For all these
reasons, the judgment in Kartar Singh (supra) cannot apply to section 45 of the present
Act." (emphasis supplied)
129. With utmost humility at our command, we do not agree with this (highlighted)
observation. The reason for distinguishing the enunciation of the Constitution Bench noted above, is
not only inapposite, but it is not consistent with the provisions in both the Acts. Even the TADA Act,
the appointment of Designated Court is from amongst the Sessions Judge or Additional Sessions
Judge in any State and the offences under that Act were made exclusively triable before such
Designated Court and not the Magistrate. The powers of the Magistrate were required to be
bestowed on the Designated Court being the Sessions Judge for the limited purpose of proceeding
with the case directly before it. This is amply clear, inter alia, from section 9, in particular clause
(6) thereof, including sections 20(3)* and 20(4)** of the TADA Act. Same is the logic adopted
under Chapter VII of the 2002 Act in constituting the Special Courts and empowering the Sessions

20. Modified application of certain provisions of the Code.
(4) Section 167 of the Code shall

section (2), after the proviso, the following proviso shall be inserted, namely "Provided further
that, if it is not possible to complete the investigation within the saidperiod of one hundred and

Judge appointed as Special Court with the powers of the Magistrate. That aspect has been dealt
with by the Constitution Bench in paragraphs 342 to 344, while approving the exposition in
Usmanbhai Dawoodbhai Memon (supra). The same reads thus :
"342. Sub-section (8) which imposes a complete ban on release on bail against the accused of
an offence punishable under this Act minimises or dilutes that ban under two conditions, those
being (1) the Public Prosecutor must be given an opportunity to oppose the bail application for
such release ; and (2) where the Public Prosecutor opposes the bail application the court must
be satisfied that the two conditions, namely, (a) there are reasonable grounds for believing that
the person accused is not guilty of such offence and (b) he is not likely to commit any offence
while on bail. Sub-section (9) qualifies sub-section (8) to the effect that the above two
limitations imposed on grant of bail specified in sub-section (8) are in addition to the limitations
under the Code or any other law for the time being in force on granting of bail. Section 436 of
the Code provides for grant of bail to a person accused of a bailable offence, while section 437
provides for grant of bail to any accused of, or suspected of, the commission of any non-bailable
offence. None the less, sub-section (1) of section 437 imposes certain fetters on the exercise of
the powers of granting bail on fulfilment of two conditions, namely, (1) if there appear
reasonable grounds for believing that he has been guilty of an offence punishable with death or
imprisonment for life ; and (2) if the offence complained of is a cognizable offence and that the
accused had been previously convicted of an offence punishable with death, imprisonment for
life or imprisonment for seven years or more or he had previously convicted on two or more
occasions of a non-bailable and cognizable offence. Of course, these two conditions are subject
to three provisos attached to sub-section (1) of section 437. But we are not very much
concerned about the provisos. However, sub-section (3) of section 437 gives discretion to the
court to grant bail attached with some conditions if it considers necessary or in the interest of
justice. For proper understanding of those conditions or limitations to which two other conditions
under clauses (a) and (b) of sub-section (8) of section 20 of the TADA Act are attached, we
reproduce those conditions in section 437(3) hereunder :
'437. (3)
(a) in order to ensure that such person shall attend in accordance with the conditions of
the bond executed under this Chapter, or
(b) in order to ensure that such person shall not commit an offence similar to the offence of
which he is accused or of the commission of which he is suspected, or
(c) otherwise in the interests of justice.
343. Section 438 of the code speaks of bail and section 439 deals with the special powers of
High Court or Court of Session regarding bail. It will be relevant to cite section 439(1)(a) also, in
this connection, which reads as follows :
'439. Special powers of High Court or Court of Session regarding bail.-(1) A High Court or
Court of Session may direct-
(a) that any person accused of an offence and in custody be released on bail, and if the
offence is of the nature specified in sub- section (3) of section 437, may impose any condition
which it considers necessary for the purposes mentioned in that sub-section
344. In this connection, we would like to quote the following observation of this court in
Usmanbhai Dawoodbhai Memon V. State of Gujarat (supra), with which we are in agreement
'Though there is no express provision excluding the applicability of section 439 of the Code
similar to the one contained in section 20(7) of the Act in relation to a case involving the
arrest of any person on an accusation of having committed an offence punishable under the
Act or any rule made thereunder, but that result must, by necessary implication, follow. It is
true that the source of power of a Designated Court to grant bail is not section 20(8) of the
Act as it only places limitations on such power. This is made explicit by section 20(9) which
enacts that the limitations on granting of bail specified in section 20(8) are "in addition to the
limitations under the Code or any other law for the time being in force". But it does not
necessarily follow that the power of a Designated Court to grant bail is relatable to section
439 of the Code. It cannot be doubted that a Designated Court is "a court other than the High
Court or the Court of Session" within the meaning of section 437 of the Code. The exercise of
the power to grant bail by a Designated Court is not only subject to the limitations contained
therein, but is also subject to the limitations placed by section 20(8) of the Act.'"
This portion of the judgment of the Constitution Bench has not been noticed in Nikesh
Tarachand Shah (supra). Further, we do not agree with the observations suggestive of that
the offence of money-laundering is less
heinous offence than the offence of terrorism sought to be tackled under TADA Act or that
there is no compelling State interest in tackling offence of money-laundering. The
international bodies have been discussing the menace of money-laundering on regular basis
for quite some time ; and strongly recommended enactment of stringent legislation for
prevention of money-laundering and combating with the menace thereof including to
prosecute the offenders and for attachment and confiscation of the proceeds of crime having
direct impact on the financial systems and sovereignty and integrity of the countries. That
concern has been duly noted even in the opening part of the introduction and Statement of
Objects and Reasons, for which the 2002 Act came into being. This declaration by Parliament
itself is testimony of compelling necessity to have stringent regime (enactment) for
prevention and control of the menace of money-laundering. Be it noted that under article 38
of the Constitution of India, it is the duty of the State to secure social, economic and political
justice and minimize income inequalities. Article 39 of the Constitution mandates the State to
prevent concentration of wealth, thus, to realize its socialist goal, it becomes imperative for
the State to make such laws, which not only ensure that the unaccounted money is infused
back in the economic system of the country, but also prevent any activity which damages the
economic fabric of the nation. It cannot be gainsaid that social and economic offences stand
on a graver footing as they not only involve an individual direct victim, but harm the society
as a whole*. Thus, the Law Commission also in its 47th report recommended an increase in
punishment for most of the offences considered therein. Further, the quantum of punishment
for money-laundering offence, being only seven years, cannot be the basis to undermine the
seriousness and gravity of this offence. The quantum of sentence is a matter of legislative
policy. The punishment provided for the offence is certainly one of the principles in deciding
the gravity of the offence, however, it cannot be said that it is the sole factor in deciding the
severity of offence as contended bv the petitioners. Monev-launderina is one of the heinous
crimes, which not only affects the social and economic fabric of the nation, but also tends to
promote other heinous offences, such as terrorism, offences related to NDPS Act, etc. It is a
proven fact that international criminal network that support home grown extremist groups
relies on transfer of unaccounted money across nation States**, thus, by any stretch of
imagination, it cannot be said that there is no compelling State interest in providing stringent
conditions of bail for the offence of money-laundering. In Ram
* 47th Law Commission Report.
Jethmalani V. Union of India*, the court expounded the theory of "soft state" which is used
to describe a nation which is not capable of preventing the offence of money-laundering. The
court held thus** :
"13. The concept of a "soft state" was famously articulated by the Nobel Laureate, Gunnar
Myrdal. It is a broad-based assessment of the degree to which the State, and its machinery,
is equipped to deal with its responsibilities of governance. The more soft the State is, greater
the likelihood that there is an unholy nexus between the law maker, the law keeper, and the
law breaker." (emphasis supplied)
In Mohanlal Jitamalji Porwal (supra), while explaining the impact of economic offences on
the community, the court observed that usually the community view the economic offender
with a permissive eye, although the impact of the offence is way greater than that of offence
of murder. The court held thus :
"5. The entire Community is aggrieved if the economic offenders who ruin the economy
of the State are not brought to books. A murder may be committed in the heat of moment
upon passions being aroused. An economic offence is committed with cool calculation and
deliberate design with an eye on personal profit regardless of the consequence to the
Community. A disregard for the interest of the Community can be manifested only at the cost
of forfeiting the trust and faith of the Community in the system to administer justice in an
even handed manner without fear of criticism from the quarters which view white collar
crimes with a permissive eye unmindful of the damage done to the National Economy and
National Interest.
" (emphasis3 supplied)
In Rohit Tandon (supra), this court observed as follows -
"21. The consistent view taken by this court is that economic offences having deep-rooted
conspiracies and involving huge loss of public funds need to be viewed seriously and considered
as grave offences affecting the economy of the country as a whole and thereby posing serious
threat to the financial health of the country. Further, when attempt is made to project the
proceeds of crime as untainted money and also that the allegations may not ultimately be
established, but having been made, the burden of proof that the monies were not the proceeds
of crime and were not, therefore, tainted shifts
Page 116 of 339 ITR.
on the accused persons under section 24 of the 2002 Act." (emphasis supplied)
Thus, it is well-settled by the various decisions of this court and policy of the State as also the
view of international community that the offence of money-laundering is committed by an
individual with a deliberate design with the motive to enhance his gains, disregarding the
interests of nation and society as a whole and which by no stretch of imagination can be termed
as offence of trivial nature. Thus, it is in the interest of the State that law enforcement agencies
should be provided with a proportionate effective mechanism so as to deal with these types of
offences as the wealth of the nation is to be safeguarded from these dreaded criminals. As
discussed above, the conspiracy of money-laundering, which is a three-staged process, is
hatched in secrecy and executed in darkness, thus, it becomes imperative for the State to frame
such a stringent law, which not only punishes the offender proportionately, but also helps in
preventing the offence and creating a deterrent effect.
130. In the case of the 2002 Act. Parliament had no reservation to reckon the offence of monev-
laundering as a serious threat to the financial systems of our country, including to its sovereignty
and integrity. Therefore, the observations and in particular in paragraph 47 of Nikesh Tarachand
Shah (supra), are in the nature of doubting the perception of Parliament in that regard, which is
beyond the scope of judicial review. That cannot be the basis to declare the law manifestly
arbitrary.
131. It is important to note that the twin conditions provided under section 45 of the 2002 Act,
though restrict the right of the accused to grant of bail, but it cannot be said that the conditions
provided under section 45 impose absolute restraint on the grant of bail. The discretion vests in the
court which is not arbitrary or irrational but judicial, guided by the principles of law as provided
under section 45 of the 2002 Act. While dealing with a similar provision prescribing twin conditions
in MCOCA, this court in Ranjitsing Brahmajeetsing Sharma (supra), held as under :
"44. The wording of section 21(4), in our opinion, does not lead to the conclusion that the
court must arrive at a positive finding that the applicant for bail has not committed an offence
under the Act. If such a construction is placed, the court intending to grant bail must arrive at a
finding that the applicant has not committed such an offence. In such an event, it will be
impossible for the prosecution to obtain a judgment of conviction of the applicant. Such cannot
be the intention of the Legislature. Section 21(4) of the MCOCA, therefore, must be
construed reasonably. It must be so construed that the court is able to maintain a delicate
balance between a judgment of acquittal and conviction and an order granting bail much before
commencement of trial. Similarly, the court will be required to record a finding as to the
possibility of his committing a crime after grant of bail. However, such an offence in futuro must
be an offence under the Act and not any other offence. Since it is difficult to predict the future
conduct of an accused, the court must necessarily consider this aspect of the matter having
regard to the antecedents of the accused, his propensities and the nature and manner in which
he is alleged to have committed the offence.
45. It is, furthermore, trite that for the purpose of considering an application for grant of bail,
although detailed reasons are not necessary to be assigned, the order granting bail must
demonstrate application of mind at least in serious cases as to why the applicant has been
granted or denied the privilege of bail.
46. The duty of the court at this stage is not to weigh the evidence meticulously but to arrive
at a finding on the basis of broad probabilities. However, while dealing with a special statute like
MCOCA having regard to the provisions contained in sub-section (4) of section 21 of the Act, the
court may have to probe into the matter deeper so as to enable it to arrive at a finding that the
materials collected against the accused during the investigation may not justify a judgment of
conviction. The findings recorded by the court while granting or refusing bail undoubtedly would
be tentative in nature, which may not have any bearing on the merit of the case and the trial
court would, thus, be free to decide the case on the basis of evidence adduced at the trial,
without in any manner being prejudiced thereby". (emphasis supplied)
We are in agreement with the observation made by the court in Ranjitsing Brahmajeetsing
Sharma (supra). The court while dealing with the application for grant of bail need not delve
deep into the merits of the case and only a view of the court based on available material on
record is required. The court will not weigh the evidence to find the guilt of the accused which is,
of course, the work of Trial Court. The court is only required to place its view based on
probability on the basis of reasonable material collected during investigation and the said view
will not be taken into consideration by the Trial court in recording its finding of the guilt or
acquittal during trial which is based on the evidence adduced during the
trial. As explained by this court in Nimmagadda Prasad (supra), the words used in section 45
of the 2002 Act are "reasonable grounds for believing" which means the court has to see only if
there is a genuine case against the accused and the prosecution is not required to prove the
charge beyond reasonable doubt.
132. Sub-section (6) of section 212 of the Companies Act imposes similar twin conditions, as
envisaged under section 45 of the 2002 Act on the grant of bail, when a person is accused of
offence under section 447 of the Companies Act which punishes fraud, with punishment of
imprisonment not less than six months and extending up to 10 years, with fine not less than the
amount involved in the fraud, and extending up to 3 times the fraud. The court in Nittin Johari
(supra), while justifying the stringent view towards grant of bail with respect to economic offences
held that-
"24. At this juncture, it must be noted that even as per section 212(7) of the Companies Act,
the limitation under section 212(6) with respect to grant of bail is in addition to those already
provided in the Cr. P. C. Thus, it is necessary to advert to the principles governing the grant of
bail under section 439 of the Cr. P. C. Specifically, heed must be paid to the stringent view taken
by this court towards grant of bail with respect of economic offences. In this regard, it is
pertinent to refer to the following observations of this court in Y. S. Jaganmohan Reddy (supra)
'34. Economic offences constitute a class apart and need to be visited with a different
approach in the matter of bail. The economic offences having deep-rooted conspiracies and
involving huge loss of public funds need to be viewed seriously and considered as grave
offences affecting the economy of the country as a whole and thereby posing serious threat to
the financial health of the country.
35. While granting bail, the court has to keep in mind the nature of accusations, the nature
of evidence in support thereof, the severity of the punishment which conviction will entail, the
character of the accused, circumstances which are peculiar to the accused, reasonable
possibility of securing the presence of the accused at the trial, reasonable apprehension of the
witnesses being tampered with, the larger interests of the public/State and other similar
considerations."" (emphasis supplied)
133. This court has been restating this position in several decisions, including Gautam Kundu
(supra) and Amit Kumar (supra). Thus, while considering the application for bail under section 45
of the 2002 Act, the court should keep in mind the abovementioned principles governing the grant
of bail. The limitations on granting bail as prescribed under section 45 of the 2002 Act are in
addition to the limitations under the 1973 Code.
134. As aforementioned, similar twin conditions have been provided in several other special
legislations* validity whereof has been upheld by this court being reasonable and having nexus
with the purposes and objects sought to be achieved by the concerned special legislations. Besides
the special legislation, even the provisions in the general law, such as 1973 Code stipulate
compliance of pre-conditions before releasing the accused on bail. The grant of bail, even though
regarded as an important right of the accused, is not a mechanical order to be passed by the
courts. The prayer for grant of bail even in respect of general offences, have to be considered on the
basis of objective discernible judicial parameters as delineated by this court from time-to-time, on
case-to-case basis.
135. We are conscious of the fact that in paragraph 53 of the Nikesh Tarachand Shah (supra),
the court noted that it had struck down section 45 of the 2002 Act as a whole. However, in
paragraph 54, the declaration is only in respect of further (two) conditions for release on bail as
contained in section 45(1), being unconstitutional as the same violated articles 14 and 21 of the
Constitution. Be that as it may, nothing would remain in that observation or for that matter, the
declaration as the defect in the provision (section 45(1)), as existed then, and noticed by this court
has been cured by Parliament by enacting amendment Act 13 of 2018 which has come into force
with effect from April 19, 2018. We, therefore, confined ourselves to the challenge to the twin
conditions in the provision, as it stands to this date post amendment of 2018 and which, on
analysis of the decisions referred to above dealing with concerned enactments having similar twin
conditions as valid, we must reject the challenge. Instead, we hold that the provision in the form of
section 45 of the 2002 Act, as applicable post amendment of 2018, is reasonable and has direct
nexus with the purposes and objects sought to be achieved by the 2002 Act to combat the menace
of

money-laundering having transnational consequences including impacting the financial systems
and sovereignty and integrity of the countries.
136. It was urged that the scheduled offence in a given case may be a non- cognizable offence
and yet rigours of section 45 of the 2002 Act would result in denial of bail even to such accused.
This argument is founded on clear misunderstanding of the scheme of the 2002 Act. As we have
repeatedly mentioned in the earlier part of this judgment that the offence of money-laundering is
one wherein a person, directly or indirectly, attempts to indulge or knowingly assists or knowingly
is a party or is actually involved in any process or activity connected with the proceeds of crime.
The fact that the proceeds of crime have been generated as a result of criminal activity relating to a
scheduled offence, which incidentally happens to be a non-cognizable offence, would make no
difference. The person is not prosecuted for the scheduled offence by invoking provisions of the
2002 Act, but only when he has derived or obtained property as a result of criminal activity relating
to or in relation to a scheduled offence and then indulges in process or activity connected with such
proceeds of crime. Suffice it to observe that the argument under consideration is completely
misplaced and needs to be rejected.
137. Another incidental issue that had been raised is about the non-application of rigours of
section 45 of the 2002 Act in respect of anticipatory bail filed under section 438 of the 1973 Code.
This submission presumably is linked to the observation in paragraph 42 in the case of Nikesh
Tarachand Shah (supra). Similar argument was considered in Asst. Director Enforcement
Directorate V. Dr. V. C. Mohan*. We are in agreement with the observation in this decision that it is
one thing to say that section 45 of the 2002 Act refers to a scheduled offence under the general
law, but, as noted earlier, the offence under this Act in terms of section 3 is specific to involvement
in any process or activity connected with the proceeds of crime which is generated as a result of
criminal activity relating to a scheduled offence. It is also true that section 45 does not make
specific reference to section 438 of the 1973 Code, but it cannot be overlooked that sub- section
(1) opens with a non obstante clause and clearly provides that anything contained in the 1973
Code (2 of 1974), no person accused of an offence under this Act shall be released on bail or on his
own bond, unless the stipulations provided therein are fulfilled. On account of the non- obstante
clause in section 45(1) of the 2002 Act, the sweep of that provision must prevail in terms of section
71 of the 2002 Act. Further, the expression "anticipatory bail" is not used either in the 1973 Code
or the 2002 Act. The
* Criminal Appeal No. 21 of 2022, decided on 4-1-2022.
relief granted in terms of section 438 of the 1973 Code is one of directing release of the person on
"bail" in case of his arrest ; and such a relief has been described in judicial pronouncements as
anticipatory bail. Section 45(1) uses generic expression "bail" without reference to any provision of
the 1973 Code, such as sections 437, 438 and 439 of the 1973 Code. Concededly, section 65 of the
2002 Act states that the provisions of the 1973 Code shall apply to the provisions under the Act in
so far as they are not inconsistent with the provisions of the 2002 Act. Further, section 71 of the
Act gives overriding effect to the Act. Section 45 of the Act begins with a non obstante clause, thus
excluding the application of the 1973 Code in matters related to "bail". The word "anticipatory bail"
has not been defined under the 1973 Code. In Sushila Aggarwal (supra), it was held as under
"7.1. At the outset, it is required to be noted that as such the expression anticipatory bail'
has not been defined in the Code. As observed by this court in Balchand Jain*, 'anticipatory bail'
means 'bail in anticipation of arrest'. As held by this court, the expression anticipatory bail' is a
misnomer inasmuch as it is not as if bail is presently granted by the court in anticipation of
arrest. An application for 'anticipatory bail' in anticipation of arrest could be moved by the
accused at a stage before an FIR is filed or at a stage when FIR is registered but the charge-
sheet has not been filed and the investigation is in progress or at a stage after the investigation
is concluded. Power to grant 'anticipatory bail' under section 438 of the CrPC vests only with the
Court of Session or the High Court. Therefore, ultimately it is for the court concerned to consider
the application for 'anticipatory bail' and while granting the 'anticipatory bail' it is ultimately for
the court concerned to impose conditions including the limited period of 'anticipatory bail',
depends upon the stages at which the application for anticipatory bail is moved. A person in
whose favour a pre-arrest bail order is made under section 438 of the CrPC has to be arrested.
However, once there is an order of pre-arrest bail/ anticipatory bail, as and when he is arrested
he has to be released on bail. Otherwise, there is no distinction or difference between the pre-
arrest bail order under section 438 and the bail order under sections 437 and 439 of the CrPC.
The only difference between the pre-arrest bail order under section 438 and the bail order under
sections 437 and 439 is the stages at which the bail order is passed. The bail order under section
438 of the CrPC is prior to his arrest and in anticipation of his arrest and the order of bail under
sections 437 and 439 is after a person is arrested. A bare reading of section 438 of the CrPC
shows
that there is nothing in the language of the section which goes to show that the pre-arrest
bail granted under section 438 has to be time-bound. The position is the same as in section 437
and section 439 of the CrPC." (emphasis supplied)
Thus, anticipatory bail is nothing but a bail granted in anticipation of arrest, hence, it has
been held in various judgments by this court that the principles governing the grant of bail in
both cases are more or less on the same footing, except that in case of anticipatory bail the
investigation is still underway requiring the presence of the accused before investigation
authority. Thus, ordinarily, anticipatory bail is granted in exceptional cases where the accused
has been falsely implicated in an offence with a view to harass and humiliate him. Therefore, it
would not be logical to disregard the limitations imposed on granting bail under section 45 of the
2002 Act, in the case of anticipatory bail as well.
138. In P. Chidambaram (supra), this court observed that the power of anticipatory bail should
be sparingly exercised in economic offences and held thus :
"77. After referring to Siddharam Satlingappa Mhetre* and other judgments and observing
that anticipatory bail can be granted only in exceptional circumstances, in Jai Prakash Singh V.
'19. Parameters for grant of anticipatory bail in a serious offence are required to be
satisfied and further while granting such relief, the court must record the reasons therefor.
Anticipatory bail can be granted only in exceptional circumstances where the court is prima
facie of the view that the applicant has falsely been enroped in the crime and would not
misuse his liberty. (See D. K. Ganesh Babu V. P. T. Manokaran* State of Maharashtra V.
Mohd. Sajid Husain Mohd. S. Husain# and Union of India V. Padam Narain Aggarwal (supra)'
Economic offences
78. Power under section 438 of the CrPC being an extraordinary remedy, has to be exercised
sparingly ; more so, in cases of economic offences. Economic offences stand as a different class
as they affect the economic fabric of the society. In Directorate of Enforcement V.
Ashok Kumar Jain*, it was held that in economic offences, the accused is not entitled to
anticipatory bail.
83. Grant of anticipatory bail at the stage of investigation may frustrate the investigating
agency in interrogating the accused and in collecting the useful information and also the
materials which might have been concealed. Success in such interrogation would elude if the
accused knows that he is protected by the order of the court. Grant of anticipatory bail,
particularly in economic offences would definitely hamper the effective investigation. Having
regard to the materials said to have been collected by the respondent-Enforcement Directorate
and considering the stage of the investigation, we are of the view that it is not a fit case to grant
anticipatory bail.
84. In a case of money-laundering where it involves many stages of 'placement', 'layering, i.
e., funds moved to other institutions to conceal origin' and 'interrogation, i. e., funds used to
acquire various assets', it requires systematic and analysed investigation which would be of
great advantage. As held in Anil Sharma** success in such interrogation would elude if the
accused knows that he is protected by a pre-arrest bail order. Section 438 of the CrPC is to be
invoked only in exceptional cases where the case alleged is frivolous or groundless. In the case
in hand, there are allegations of laundering the proceeds of the crime. The Enforcement
Directorate claims to have certain specific inputs from various sources, including overseas banks.
Letter rogatory is also said to have been issued and some response have been received by the
Department. Having regard to the nature of allegations and the stage of the investigation, in our
view, the investigating agency has to be given sufficient freedom in the process of investigation.
Though we do not endorse the approach of the learned single judge in extracting the note
produced by the Enforcement Directorate, we do not find any ground warranting interference
with the impugned order***, Considering the facts and circumstances of the case, in our view,
grant of anticipatory bail to the appellant will hamper the investigation and this is not a fit case
for exercise of discretion to grant anticipatory bail to the appellant." (emphasis supplied)
139. Therefore, as noted above, investigation in an economic offence, more so in case of money-
laundering, requires a systematic approach. Further, it can never be the intention of Parliament to
exclude the operation of section
45 of 2002 Act in the case of anticipatory bail, otherwise, it will create an unnecessary dichotomy
between bail and anticipatory bail which not only will be irrational but also discriminatory and
arbitrary. Thus, it is totally misconceived that the rigours of section 45 of the 2002 Act will not
apply in the case of anticipatory bail.
140. Suffice it to observe that it would be preposterous and illogical to hold that if a person
applies for bail after arrest, he/she can be granted that relief only if the twin conditions are fulfilled
in addition to other stipulations predicated in the 1973 Code ; but another person, who is yet to be
arrested in connection with the same offence of money-laundering, will not be required to fulfil
such twin conditions whilst considering application for grant of bail under section 438 of the 1973
Code. The relief of bail, be it in the nature of regular bail or anticipatory bail, is circumscribed by
the stipulations predicated in section 45 of the 2002 Act. The underlying principles of section 45 of
the 2002 Act would get triggered in either case before the relief of bail in connection with the
offence of money-laundering is taken forward. Any other view would be counterproductive and
defeat the purposes and objects behind the stringent provision enacted by Parliament for
prevention of money-laundering and to combat the menace on account of such activity which
directly impacts the financial systems, including the sovereignty and integrity of the country.
141. As a result, we have no hesitation in observing that in whatever form the relief is couched
including the nature of proceedings, be it under section 438 of the 1973 Code or for that matter, by
invoking the jurisdiction of the Constitutional Court, the underlying principles and rigours of section
45 of the 2002 Act must come into play and without exception ought to be reckoned to uphold the
objectives of the 2002 Act, which is a special legislation providing for stringent regulatory measures
for combating the menace of money-laundering.
142. There is, however, an exception carved out to the strict compliance of the twin conditions
in the form of section 436A of the 1973 Code, which has come into being on June 23, 2006 vide Act
25 of 2005. This, being the subsequent law enacted by the Parliament, must prevail. Section 436A
of the 1973 Code reads as under :
"#436A. Maximum period for which an undertrial prisoner can be detained.- Where a person
has, during the period of investigation, inquiry or trial under this Code of an offence under any
law (not being an offence for which the punishment of death has been specified as one of the
punishments under that law) undergone
# Inserted by Act 25 of 2005, section 36 (w. e. f. 23-6-2006).
detention for a period extending up to one-half of the maximum period of imprisonment
specified for that offence under that law, he shall be released by the court on his personal bond
with or without sureties :
Provided that the court may, after hearing the Public Prosecutor and for reasons to be
recorded by it in writing, order the continued detention of such person for a period longer than
one-half of the said period or release him on bail instead of the personal bond with or without
sureties :
Provided further that no such person shall in any case be detained during the period of
investigation, inquiry or trial for more than the maximum period of imprisonment provided for
the said offence under that law.
Explanation.-In computing the period of detention under this section for granting bail, the
period of detention passed due to delay in proceeding caused by the accused shall be excluded."
In the statement of objects and reasons, it was stated thus :
"There had been instances, where under-trial prisoners were detained in jail for periods
beyond the maximum period of imprisonment provided for the alleged offence. As remedial
measure section 436A has been inserted to provide that where an under-trial prisoner other than
the one accused of an offence for which death has been prescribed as one of the punishments,
has been under detention for a period extending to one-half of the maximum period of
imprisonment provided for the alleged offence, he should be released on his personal bond, with
or without sureties. It has also been provided that in no case will an under-trial prisoner be
detained beyond the maximum period of imprisonment for which he can be convicted for the
alleged offence."
143. In Hussainara Khatoon V. Home Secretary, State of Bihar*, this court stated that the right
to speedy trial is one of the facets of article 21 and recognised the right to speedy trial as a
fundamental right. This dictum has been consistently followed by this court in several cases.
Parliament in its wisdom inserted section 436A under the 1973 Code recognising the deteriorating
state of undertrial prisoners so as to provide them with a remedy in case of unjustified detention.
In Supreme Court Legal Aid Committee Representing Undertrial Prisoners V. Union of India**, the
court, relying on Hussainara Khatoon (supra), directed the release of prisoners charged under the
Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Act after completion
of one-half of the maximum term prescribed under the Act. The court issued such direction after
taking into account the non obstante provision of section 37 of the NDPS Act, which imposed the
rigours of twin conditions for release on bail. It was observed :
"15.
We are conscious of the statutory provision finding place in section 37 of the Act
prescribing the conditions which have to be satisfied before a person accused of an offence under
the Act can be released. Indeed we have adverted to this section in the earlier part of the
judgment. We have also kept in mind the interpretation placed on a similar provision in section
20 of the TADA Act by the Constitution Bench in Kartar Singh V. State of Punjab (supra). Despite
this provision, we have directed as above mainly at the call of article 21 as the right to speedy
trial may even require in some cases quashing of a criminal proceeding altogether, as held by a
Constitution Bench of this court in Abdul Rehman Antulay V. R. S. Nayak*, release on bail, which
can be taken to be embedded in the right of speedy trial, may, in some cases be the demand of
article 21. As we have not felt inclined to accept the extreme submission of quashing the
proceedings and setting free the accused whose trials have been delayed beyond reasonable
The surest way t legal research!"
time for reasons already alluded to, we have felt that deprivation of the personal liberty without
ensuring speedy trial would also not be in consonance with the right guaranteed by article 21. Of
course, some amount of deprivation of personal liberty cannot be avoided in such cases ; but if
the period of deprivation pending trial becomes unduly long, the fairness assured by article 21
would receive a jolt. It is because of this that we have felt that after the accused persons have
suffered imprisonment which is half of the maximum punishment provided for the offence, any
further deprivation of personal liberty would be violative of the fundamental right visualised by
article 21, which has to be telescoped with the right guaranteed by article 14 which also
promises justness, fairness and reasonableness in procedural matters
"
144. The Union of India also recognised the right to speedy trial and access to justice as
fundamental right in their written submissions and, thus, submitted that in a limited situation right
of bail can be granted in case of violation of article 21 of the Constitution. Further, it is to be noted
that the section 436A of the 1973 Code was inserted after the enactment of the 2002 Act. Thus, it
would not be appropriate to deny the relief of section 436A of the 1973 Code which is a wholesome
provision beneficial to a person
accused under the 2002 Act. However, section 436A of the 1973 Code, does not provide for an
absolute right of bail as in the case of default bail under section 167 of the 1973 Code. For, in the
fact situation of a case, the court may still deny the relief owing to ground, such as where the trial
was delayed at the instance of accused himself.
145. Be that as it may, in our opinion, this provision is comparable with the statutory bail
provision or, so to say, the default bail, to be granted in terms of section 167 of the 1973 Code
consequent to failure of the investigating agency to file the charge-sheet within the statutory
period and, in the context of the 2002 Act, complaint within the specified period after arrest of the
person concerned. In the case of section 167 of the 1973 Code, an indefeasible right is triggered in
favour of the accused the moment the investigating agency commits default in filing the charge-
sheet/complaint within the statutory period. The provision in the form of section 436A of the 1973
Code, as has now come into being is in recognition of the constitutional right of the accused
regarding speedy trial under article 21 of the Constitution. For, it is a sanguine hope of every
accused, who is in custody in particular, that he/she should be tried expeditiously-so as to uphold
the tenets of speedy justice. If the trial cannot proceed even after the accused has undergone one-
half of the maximum period of imprisonment provided by law, there is no reason to deny him this
lesser relief of considering his prayer for release on bail or bond, as the case may be, with
appropriate conditions, including to secure his/her presence during the trial.
146. Learned Solicitor General was at pains to persuade us that this view would impact the
objectives of the 2002 Act and is in the nature of super imposition of section 436A of the 1973
Code over section 45 of the 2002 Act. He has also expressed concern that the same logic may be
invoked in respect of other serious offences, including terrorist offences which would be
counterproductive. So be it. We are not impressed by this submission. For, it is the constitutional
obligation of the State to ensure that trials are concluded expeditiously and at least within a
reasonable time where strict bail provisions apply. If a person is detained for a period extending up
to one-half of the maximum period of imprisonment specified by law and is still facing trial, it is
nothing short of failure of the State in upholding the constitutional rights of the citizens, including
person accused of an offence.
147. Section 436A of the 1973 Code, is a wholesome beneficial provision, which is for
effectuating the right of speedy trial guaranteed by article 21 of the Constitution and which merely
specifies the outer limits within which the trial is expected to be concluded, failing which, the
accused ought not to be detained further. Indeed, section 436A of the 1973 Code also con
templates that the relief under this provision cannot be granted mechanically. It is still within the
discretion of the court, unlike the default bail under section 167 of the 1973 Code. Under section
436A of the 1973 Code, however, the court is required to consider the relief on case-to-case basis.
As the proviso therein itself recognises that, in a given case, the detention can be continued by the
court even longer than one-half of the period. for which. reasons are to be recorded bv it in writing
and also by imposing such terms and conditions so as to ensure that after release, the accused
makes himself/herself available for expeditious completion of the trial.
148. However, that does not mean that the principle enunciated by this court in Supreme Court
Legal Aid Committee Representing Undertrial Prisoners (supra), to ameliorate the agony and pain of
persons kept in jail for unreasonably long time, even without trial, can be whittled down on such
specious plea of the State. If Parliament/Legislature provides for stringent provision of no bail,
unless the stringent conditions are fulfilled, it is the bounden duty of the State to ensure that such
trials get precedence and are concluded within a reasonable time, at least before the accused
undergoes detention for a period extending up to one-half of the maximum period of imprisonment
specified for the concerned offence by law. [Be it noted, this provision (section 436A of the 1973
Code) is not available to accused who is facing trial for offences punishable with death sentence].
149. In our opinion, therefore, section 436A needs to be construed as a statutory bail provision
and akin to section 167 of the 1973 Code. Notably, learned Solicitor General has fairly accepted
during the arguments and also restated in the written notes that the mandate of section 167 of the
1973 Code would apply with full force even to cases falling under section 3 of the 2002 Act,
regarding money-laundering offences. On the same logic, we must hold that section 436A of the
1973 Code could be invoked by accused arrested for offence punishable under the 2002 Act, being
a statutory bail.
Section 50 of the 2002 Act
150. The validity of this provision has been challenged on the ground of being violative of
articles 20(3) and 21 of the Constitution. For, it allows the authorised officer under the 2002 Act to
summon any person and record his statement during the course of investigation. Further, the
provision mandates that the person should disclose true and correct facts known to his personal
knowledge in connection with the subject matter of investigation. The person is also obliged to sign
the statement so given with the threat of being punished for the falsity or incorrectness thereof in
terms of section 63 of the 2002 Act. Before we proceed to analyse the matter further,
it is apposite to reproduce section 50 of the 2002 Act, as amended. The same reads thus :
"50. Powers of authorities regarding summons, production of documents and to give evidence,
etc. - (1) The Director shall, for the purposes of section 13, have the same powers as are vested
in a civil court under the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (5 of 1908) while trying a suit in respect
of the following matters, namely :-
(a) discovery and inspection ;
(b) enforcing the attendance of any person, including any officer of a *reporting entity, and
examining him on oath ;
(c) compelling the production of records ;
(d) receiving evidence on affidavits ;
(e) issuing commissions for examination of witnesses and documents ; and
(f) any other matter which may be prescribed.
(2) The Director, Additional Director, Joint Director, Deputy Director or Assistant Director shall
have power to summon any person whose attendance he considers necessary whether to give
evidence or to produce any records during the course of any investigation or proceeding under
this Act.
(3) All the persons so summoned shall be bound to attend in person or through authorised
agents, as such officer may direct, and shall be bound to state the truth upon any subject
respecting which they are examined or make statements, and produce such documents as may
be required.
(4) Every proceeding under sub-sections (2) and (3) shall be deemed to be a judicial
proceeding within the meaning of section 193 and section 228 of the Indian Penal Code (45 of
1860).
(5) Subject to any rules made in this behalf by the Central Government, any officer referred
to in sub-section (2) may impound and retain in his custody for such period, as he thinks fit, any
records produced before him in any proceedings under this Act :
Provided that an Assistant Director or a Deputy Director shall not-
(a) impound any records without recording his reasons for so doing ; or
* Substituted by Act 2 of 2013, section 22, for "banking company or a financial institution or a
company" (w. e. f. 15-2-2013, vide S. O. 343(E), dated 8-2-2013).
(b) retain in his custody any such records for a period exceeding three months, without
obtaining the previous approval of the *Joint Director."
151. Section 50 forms part of Chapter VIII of the 2002 Act which deals with matters connected
with authorities referred to in section 48 in the same Chapter. Section 50 has been amended vide
Act 2 of 2013 and again, by Act 13 of 2018. Nothing much would turn on these amendments.
152. By this provision, the Director has been empowered to exercise the same powers as are
vested in a civil court under the 1908 Code while trying a suit in respect of matters specified in sub
-section (1). This is in reference to section 13 of the 2002 Act dealing with powers of Director to
impose fine in respect of acts of commission and omission by the banking companies, financial
institutions and intermediaries. From the setting in which section 50 has been placed and the
expanse of empowering the Director with same powers as are vested in a civil court for the
purposes of imposing fine under section 13, is obviously very specific and not otherwise.
153. Indeed, sub-section (2) of section 50 enables the Director, Additional Director, Joint
Director, Deputy Director or Assistant Director to issue summon to any person whose attendance he
considers necessary for giving evidence or to produce any records during the course of any
investigation or proceeding under this Act. We have already highlighted the width of expression
"proceeding" in the earlier part of this judgment and held that it applies to proceeding before the
Adjudicating Authority or the Special Court, as the case may be. Nevertheless, sub-section (2)
empowers the authorised officials to issue summon to any person. We fail to understand as to how
article 20(3) would come into play in respect of process of recording statement pursuant to such
summon which is only for the purpose of collecting information or evidence in respect of proceeding
under this Act. Indeed, the person so summoned, is bound to attend in person or through
authorised agent and to state truth upon any subject concerning which he is being examined or is
expected to make statement and produce documents as may be required by virtue of sub-section
(3) of section 50 of the 2002 Act. The criticism is essentially because of subsection (4) which
provides that every proceeding under sub-sections (2) and (3) shall be deemed to be a judicial
proceeding within the meaning of sections 193 and 228 of the IPC. Even so, the fact remains that
article 20(3) or for that matter section 25 of the Evidence Act, would come into play only when the
person so summoned is an accused of any offence at the relevant time and is being
*
Substituted by Act 13 of 2018, section 208(f), for "Director" (w.e.f. 19-4-2018, vide G. S. R. 383
(E), dated 19th April, 2018).
compelled to be a witness against himself. This position is well-established. The Constitution Bench
of this court in M. P. Sharma (supra) had dealt with a similar challenge wherein warrants to obtain
documents required for investigation were issued by the Magistrate being violative of article 20(3)
of the Constitution. This court opined that the guarantee in article 20(3) is against "testimonial
compulsion" and is not limited to oral evidence. Not only that, it gets triggered if the person is
compelled to be a witness against himself, which may not happen merely because of issuance of
summons for giving oral evidence or producing documents. Further, to be a witness is nothing
more than to furnish evidence and such evidence can be furnished by different modes. The court
went on to observe as follows :
"Broadly stated the guarantee in article 20(3) is against 'testimonial compulsion'. It is
suggested that this is confined to the oral evidence of a person standing his trial for an offence
when called to the witness-stand. We can see no reason to confine the content of the
constitutional guarantee to this barely literal import. So to limit it would be to rob the guarantee
of its substantial purpose and to miss the substance for the sound as stated in certain American
decisions. The phrase used in article 20(3) is 'to be a witness'. A person can 'be a witness' not
merely by giving oral evidence but also by producing documents or making intelligible gestures
as in the case of a dumb witness (see section 119 of the Evidence Act) or the like. 'To be a
witness' is nothing more than 'to furnish evidence', and such evidence can be furnished through
the lips or by production of a thing or of a document or in other modes. So far as production of
documents is concerned, no doubt section 139 of the Evidence Act says that a person producing
a document on summons is not a witness. But that section is meant to regulate the right of
cross-examination. It is not a guide to the connotation of the word 'witness', which must be
understood in its natural sense, i. e., as referring to a person who furnishes evidence. Indeed,
every positive volitional act which furnishes evidence is testimony, and testimonial compulsion
connotes coercion which procures the positive volitional evidentiary acts of the person, as
opposed to the negative attitude of silence or submission on his part. Nor is there any reason to
think that the protection in respect of the evidence so procured is confined to what transpires at
the trial in the court room. The phrase used in article 20(3) is 'to be a witness' and not to
'appear as a witness'. It follows that the protection afforded to an accused in so far as it is
related to the phrase 'to be a
witness' is not merely in respect of testimonial compulsion in the court room but may well
extend to compelled testimony previously obtained from him. It is available therefore to a
person against whom a formal accusation relating to the commission of an offence has been
levelled which in the normal course may result in prosecution. Whether it is available to other
persons in other situations does not call for decision in this case." (emphasis supplied)
154. In the case of Mohammed Dastagir (supra), the court restated that the requirement to
invoke the protection under article 20(3) is that the person must be formally accused of the offence
and observed thus :
"(9).
'Considered in this light, the guarantee under article 20(3) would be available in the present
cases these petitioners against whom a First Information Report has been recorded as accused
therein. It would extend to any compulsory process for production of evidentiary documents
which are reasonably likely to support a prosecution against them.'
These observations were unnecessary in Sharma's case (supra), having regard to the fact that
this court held that the seizure of documents on a search warrant was not unconstitutional as
that would not amount to a compulsory production of incriminating evidence. In the present
case, even on what was stated in Sharma's case (supra), there was no formal accusation against
the appellant relating to the commission of an offence. Mr. Kaliyappan had clearly stated that he
was not doing any investigation. It does not appear from his evidence that he had even accused
the appellant of having committed any offence. Even if it were to be assumed that the appellant
was a person accused of an offence the circumstances do not establish that he was compelled to
produce the money which he had on his person. No doubt he was asked to do so. It was,
however, within his power to refuse to comply with Mr. Kaliyappan's request. In our opinion, the
facts established in the present case show that the appellant was not compelled to produce the
currency notes and therefore do not attract the provisions of article 20(3) of the
Constitution." (emphasis1 supplied)
155. In yet another case in Raja Narayan Bansilal (supra), the Constitution Bench dealt with the
challenge to the validity of the notice served on the appellant for asking the appellant to attend the
office of the Inspector appointed by the Central Government to investigate into the affairs of the
company and for giving statement and producing books of account and other documents. The court
repelled the said challenge in the following words :
"(25).
Similarly, for invoking the constitutional right against testimonial compulsion
guaranteed under article 20(3) it must appear that a formal accusation has been made against
the party pleading the guarantee and that it relates to the commission of an offence which in the
normal course may result in prosecution.
(27).
The cardinal words of the section are those which empower the Commissioner or his
inspector to examine into and report on the affairs of the society'. Thus it is clear that the
examination of, or investigation into, the affairs of the company cannot be regarded as a
proceeding started against any individual after framing an accusation against him. Besides it is
quite likely that in some cases investigation may disclose that there are no irregularities, or if
there are they do not amount to the commission of any offence ; in such cases there would
obviously be no occasion for the Central Government to institute criminal proceedings under
section 242(1). Therefore, in our opinion, the High Court was right in holding that when the
inspector issued the impugned notices against the appellant he cannot be said to have been
accused of any offence ; and so the first essential condition for the application of article 20(3) is
absent. We ought to add that in the present case the same conclusion would follow even if the
clause 'accused of any offence' is interpreted more liberally than was done in the case of M. P.
Sharma (supra) because even if the expression 'accused of any offence' is interpreted in a very
broad and liberal way it is clear that at the relevant stage the appellant has not been, and in law
cannot be, accused of any offence
(emphasis supplied)
156. Again, the question came up for consideration before the eleven Judges of this court in
Kathi Kalu Oghad (supra), wherein the court noted that the person on whom summon has been
served, must fulfil the character of an accused person at the time of making the statement. The
court expounded thus :
"(15) In order to bring the evidence within the inhibitions of clause (3) of article 20 it is must
be shown not only that the person making the statement was an accused at the time he made it
and that it had a material bearing on the criminality of the maker of the statement, but also that
he was compelled to make that statement. 'Compulsion' in
the context, must mean what in law is called 'duress'. In the Dictionary of English Law by Earl
Jowitt, 'duress' is explained as follows :
'Duress is where a man is compelled to do an act by injury, beating or unlawful imprisonment
(sometimes called duress in strict sense) or by the threat of being killed, suffering some
grievous bodily harm, or being unlawfully imprisoned (sometimes called menace, or duress per
mines). Duress also includes threatening, beating or imprisonment of the wife, parent or child of
a person." (emphasis supplied)
157. In another celebrated decision of this court in Ramesh Chandra Mehta (supra), while
following the earlier decisions and dealing with the challenge in reference to the provisions of the
Sea Customs Act, the court noted thus
"In the two earlier cases M. P. Sharma's case (supra) and Raja Narayan Bansilal case (supra)
this court in describing a person accused used the expression 'against whom a formal accusation
had been made', and in Kathi Kalu Oghad's case (supra) this court used the expression 'the
person accused must have stood in the character of an accused person'. Counsel for Mehta urged
that the earlier authorities were superseded in Kathi Kalu Oghad's case (supra) and it was ruled
that a statement made by a person standing in the character of a person accused of an offence is
inadmissible by virtue of article 20(3) of the Constitution. But the court in Kathi Kalu Oghad's
case (supra) has not set out a different test for determining the stage when a person may be
said to be accused of an offence. In Kathi Kalu Oghad's case (supra) the court merely set out the
principles in the light of the effect of a formal accusation on a person, viz., that he stands in the
character of an accused person at the time when he makes the statement. Normally a person
stands in the character of an accused when a First Information Report is lodged against him in
respect of an offence before an Officer competent to investigate it, or when a complaint is made
relating to the commission of an offence before a Magistrate competent to try or send to another
Magistrate for trial the offence. Where a Customs Officer arrests a person and informs that
person of the grounds of his arrest, (which he is bound to do under article 22(1) of the
Constitution) for the purposes of holding an enquiry into the infringement of the provisions of
the Sea Customs Act which he has reason to believe has taken place, there is no formal
accusation of an offence. In the case of an offence by infringement of
the Sea Customs Act and punishable at the trial before a Magistrate there is an accusation
when a complaint is lodged by an officer competent in that behalf before the
Magistrate." (emphasis supplied)
158. Relying on the exposition in Nandini Satpathy (supra), it was urged that it is not necessary
that a formal accusation is made against the person in the form of FIR/ECIR/chargesheet/complaint
to invoke protection under article 20(3) of the Constitution and that protection is available even to
a suspect at the time of interrogation. (See also Balkishan A. Devidayal (supra) and Selvi (supra)).
159. In the context of the 2002 Act, it must be remembered that the summon is issued by the
Authority under section 50 in connection with the inquiry regarding proceeds of crime which may
have been attached and pending adjudication before the Adjudicating Authority. In respect of such
action, the designated officials have been empowered to summon any person for collection of
information and evidence to be presented before the Adjudicating Authority. It is not necessarily for
initiating a prosecution against the noticee as such. The power entrusted to the designated officials
under this Act, though couched as investigation in real sense, is to undertake inquiry to ascertain
relevant facts to facilitate initiation of or pursuing with an action regarding proceeds of crime, if the
situation so warrants and for being presented before the Adjudicating Authority. It is a different
matter that the information and evidence so collated during the inquiry made, may disclose
commission of offence of money-laundering and the involvement of the person, who has been
summoned for making disclosures pursuant to the summons issued by the Authority. At this stage,
there would be no formal document indicative of likelihood of involvement of such person as an
accused of offence of money-laundering. If the statement made by him reveals the offence of
money-laundering or the existence of proceeds of crime, that becomes actionable under the Act
itself. To put it differently, at the stage of recording of statement for the purpose of inquiring into
the relevant facts in connection with the property being proceeds of crime is, in that sense, not an
investigation for prosecution as such ; and in any case, there would be no formal accusation against
the noticee. Such summons can be issued even to witnesses in the inquiry so conducted by the
authorised officials. However, after further inquiry on the basis of other material and evidence, the
involvement of such person (noticee) is revealed, the authorised officials can certainly proceed
against him for his acts of commission or omission. In such a situation, at the stage of issue of
summons, the person cannot claim protection under article 20(3) of the
Constitution. However, if his/her statement is recorded after a formal arrest by the ED official, the
consequences of article 20(3) or section 25 of the Evidence Act may come into play to urge that the
same being in the nature of confession, shall not be proved against him. Further, it would not
preclude the prosecution from proceeding against such a person including for consequences under
section 63 of the 2002 Act on the basis of other tangible material to indicate the falsity of his claim.
That would be a matter of rule of evidence.
160. The Andhra Pradesh High Court in Dalmia Cement (Bharat) Limited (supra), while dealing
with the purpose of investigation under section 50(2) noted that it is essentially for collecting
evidence with regard to the involvement of a person or about existence of certain facts concerning
proceeds of crime or process or activity connected with proceeds of crime, such inquiry or
investigation could be commenced on the basis of information to be recorded in the internal
document maintained by the authority authorised also described as ECIR. The High Court noted as
follows
"33. In the light of the detailed submissions of the learned senior counsel on either side, the
point for consideration is : Whether the summons issued to the second petitioner under section
50(2) and (3) of the PMLA is violative of the Constitutional protection and guarantee under
article 20(3) of the Constitution of India.
47. At this stage, therefore, investigation is only for the purpose of collecting evidence with
regard to proceeds of crime in the hands of the persons suspected and their involvement, if any,
in the offence under section 3 of PMLA. I am, therefore, unable to equate ECIR registered by the
first respondent to an FIR under section 154 of the Cr.P.C and consequently, I agree with the
learned Additional Solicitor General that under the PMLA the petitioners are not accused at
present. Consequently, therefore, the submission on behalf of the petitioners on the assumption
that petitioners are accused under the PMLA is liable to be rejected." (emphasis supplied)
161. The Delhi High Court also had occasion to examine the provisions of the 2002 Act in
Vakamulla Chandrashekhar (supra) and noted the special feature of the 2002 Act which deals with
both civil and criminal consequences as against the offender. Having so noted, the High Court
observed as follows :
"11. The act of money-laundering has both civil and criminal consequences for the
perpetrator. To deal with the civil consequences,
the Act creates, and empowers the adjudicating authority (under section 2(1)(a) read with
section 6) with powers of a Civil Court to summon, direct production of documents and evidence
(see section 11), and adjudicate on the issue whether any property is involved in money-
laundering (section 8). It also creates the right of appeal from orders of the Adjudicating
Authority (section 26), and designates the Appellate Tribunal authorized to hear appeals (section
2(b) read with section 25). It also creates a right of further appeal before the High Court
(section 42)."
162. It is, thus, clear that the power invested in the officials is one for conducting inquiry into
the matters relevant for ascertaining existence of proceeds of crime and the involvement of persons
in the process or activity connected therewith so as to initiate appropriate action against such
person including of seizure, attachment and confiscation of the property eventually vesting in the
Central Government.
1 We are conscious of the fact that the expression used in section 2(1)(na) of the 2002 Act is
"investigation", but there is obvious distinction in the expression "investigation" occurring in the
1973 Code. Under section 2(h) of the 1973 Code, the investigation is done by a "police officer" or
by any person (other than a Magistrate) who is authorised by a Magistrate thereby to collect the
evidence regarding the crime in question. Whereas, the investigation under section 2(1)(na) of the
2002 Act is conducted by the Director or by an authority authorised by the Central Government
under the 2002 Act for the collection of evidence for the purpose of proceeding under this Act.
Obviously, this investigation is in the nature of inquiry to initiate action against the proceeds of
crime and prevent activity of money-laundering. In the process of such investigation, the Director
or the authority authorised by the Central Government referred to in section 48 of the 2002 Act is
empowered to resort to attachment of the proceeds of crime and for that purpose, also to do search
and seizure and to arrest the person involved in the offence of money-laundering. While doing so,
the prescribed authority (Director, Additional Director, Joint Director, Deputy Director or Assistant
Director) alone has been empowered to summon any person for recording his statement and
production of documents as may be necessary by virtue of section 50 of the 2002 Act. Sensu
stricto, at this stage (of issuing summon), it is not an investigation for initiating prosecution in
respect of crime of money-laundering as such. That is only an incidental matter and may be the
consequence of existence of proceeds of crime and identification of persons involved in money-
laundering thereof. The legislative scheme makes it amply clear that the authority authorised under
this
Act is not a police officer as such. This becomes amply clear from the speech of the then Finance
Minister delivered in 2005, which reads thus :
"Sir, the Money-Laundering Act was passed by this House in the year 2002, and number of
steps have to be taken to implement it. Sir, two kinds of steps were required. One was to
appoint an authority who will gather intelligence and information, and the other was an authority
to investigate and prosecute. This Act was made to implement the political declaration adopted
by the Special Session of the UN General Assembly in 1999. Section 1(3) of the Act stipulates
that the Act will come into force on such date as the Central Government may by notification
appoint. While we were examining the question of notifying the Act, I found that there was
certain lacunae in the Act. I regret to say that not enough homework had been done in the
definitions, and in the division of responsibility and authority. So, in consultation with the
Ministry of Law, we came to the conclusion that these lacunae had to be removed. Broadly, the
reasons for the amendment are the following.
Under the existing provisions in section 45 of the Act, every offence is cognizable. If an
offence is cognizable, then any police officer in India can arrest an offender without warrant. At
the same time, under section 19 of the Act, only a Director or a Deputy Director or an Assistant
Director or any other officer authorised, may arrest an offender. Clearly, there was a conflict
between these two provisions. Under section 45(1)(b) of the Act, the Special Court shall not take
cognizance of any offence punishable under section 4 except upon a complaint made in writing
by the Director or any other officer authorised by the Central Government. So, what would
happen to an arrest made by any police officer in the case of a cognizable offence ? Which is the
court that will try the offence ? Clearly, there were inconsistencies in these provisions.
They have now been removed. We have now enabled only the Director or an officer authorised
by him to investigate offences. Of course, we would, by rule, set up a threshold ; and, below that
threshold, we would allow State police officers also to take action.
The second anomaly that we found was that the expression "investigation officer" and the
word "investigation" occur in a number of sections but they were not defined in the Act.
Consequently, one has to go to the definition in the Criminal Procedure Code and that Code
provides only "investigation by a police officer or by an officer authorised by a magistrate". So,
clearly, there was a lacuna in not enabling
the Director or the Assistant Director under this Act to investigate offences. That has been
cured now.
What we are doing is, we are inserting a new section 2(n)(a) defining the term,
'investigation' ; making an amendment to sections 28, 29 and 30, dealing with tribunals
;
amending sections 44 and 45 of the Act to make the offence non-cognisable so that only the
Director could take action ; and also making consequential changes in section 73. I request hon.
Members to kindly approve of these amendments so that the Act could be amended quickly and
we could bring it into force." (emphasis supplied)
From this speech, it is more than clear that the intention of Parliament was to empower the
prescribed Authority under section 48 including the class of officers appointed for the purposes
of this Act to investigate the matters falling within the purview of the Act and in the manner
specified in that regard. By inserting section 45(1A) in the 2002 Act vide amendment Act 20 of
2005, was essentially to restrict and explicitly disable the police officer from taking cognizance of
the offence of money-laundering much less investigating the same. It is a provision to restate
that only the authority (section 48) under this Act is competent to do investigation in respect of
matters specified under the 2002 Act and none else. This provision rules out coextensive power
to local police as well as the authority authorised. As aforementioned, the officer specifically
authorised is also expected to confine the inquiry/investigation only in respect of matters under
this Act and in the manner specified therein.
164. The purposes and objects of the 2002 Act for which it has been enacted, is not limited to
punishment for offence of money-laundering, but also to provide measures for prevention of money
-laundering. It is also to provide for attachment of proceeds of crime, which are likely to be
concealed, transferred or dealt with in any manner which may result in frustrating any proceeding
relating to confiscation of such proceeds under the 2002 Act. This Act is also to compel the banking
companies, financial institutions and intermediaries to maintain records of the transactions, to
furnish information of such transactions within the prescribed time in terms of Chapter IV of the
2002 Act*.
164A. Considering the above, it is unfathomable as to how the authorities referred to in
section 48 can be described as police officer. The word "police" in common parlance means a
civil force whose main aim is to prevent and detect crimes and to maintain law and order of the
nation
as expounded in Barkat Ram (supra). In this decision, while dealing with the role of Customs
Officer under the Land Customs Act, 1924*, the court opined as follows :
"The Police Act, 1861 (Act V of 1861), is described as an Act for the regulation of police, and
is thus an Act for the regulation of that group of officers who come within the word 'police'
whatever meaning be given to that word. The preamble of the Act further says : 'whereas it is
expedient to re-organise the police and to make it a more efficient instrument for the prevention
and detection of crime, it is enacted as follows'. This indicates that the police is the instrument
for the prevention and detection of crime which can be said to be the main object and purpose of
having the police. Sections 23 and 25 lay down the duties of the police officers and section 20
deals with the authority they can exercise. They can exercise such authority as is provided for a
police officer under the Police Act and any Act for regulating criminal procedure. The authority
given to police officers must naturally be to enable them to discharge their duties efficiently. Of
the various duties mentioned in section 23, the more important duties are to collect and
communicate intelligence affecting the public peace, to prevent the commission of offences and
public nuisances and to detect and bring offenders to justice and to apprehend all persons whom
the police officer is legally authorised to apprehend. It is clear, therefore, in view of the nature of
the duties imposed on the police officers, the nature of the authority conferred and the purpose
of the police Act, that the powers which the police officers enjoy are powers for the effective
prevention and detection of crime in order to maintain law and order." (emphasis supplied)
And again, opined thus :
"
The Customs Officer, therefore, is not primarily concerned with the detection and
punishment of crime committed by a person, but is mainly interested in the detection and
prevention of smuggling of goods and safeguarding the recovery of customs duties. He is more
concerned with the goods and customs duty, than with the offender."
Thus, this court concluded that the Customs Officer under the Land Customs Act is not a
police officer within the meaning of section 25 of the Evidence Act. In that, the main object of
the Customs Officer is to safeguard goods and customs duty and detection and prevention of
crime is an ancillary function.
* For short, "Land Customs Act".
165. On similar lines, in the case of Raja Ram Jaiswal (supra), while examining the efficacy of
confession made to an Excise Inspector under the 1915 Act, the court held as follows :
"(10).
Thus he can excise all the powers which an officer in charge of a police station can
exercise under Chapter XIV of the Code of Criminal Procedure. He can investigate into offences,
record statements of the persons questioned by him, make searches, seize any articles
connected with an offence under the Excise Act, arrest an accused person, grant him bail, send
him up for trial before a Magistrate, file a charge-sheet and so on. Thus his position in so far as
offences under the Excise Act committed within the area to which his appointment extends are
concerned is not different from that of an officer in charge of a police station. As regards these
offences not only is he charged with the duty of preventing their commission but also with their
detection and is for these purposes empowered to act in all respects as an officer in charge of a
police station. No doubt unlike an officer in charge of a police station he is not charged with the
duty of the maintenance of law and order nor can he exercise the powers of such officer with
respect to offences under the general law or under any other special laws. But all the same, in so
far as offences under the Excise Act are concerned, there is no distinction whatsoever in the
nature of the powers he exercises and those which a police officer exercises in relation to
offences which it is his duty to prevent and bring to light. It would be logical, therefore, to hold
that a confession recorded by him during an investigation into an excise offence cannot
reasonably be regarded as anything different from a confession to a police officer. For, in
conducting the investigation he exercises the powers of a police officer and the act itself deems
him to be a police officer, even though he does not belong to the police force constituted under
the Police Act. It has been held by this court that the expression 'police officer' in section 25 of
the Evidence Act is not confined to persons who are members of the regularly constituted police
force. The position of an Excise Officer empowered under section 77(2) of the Bihar and Orissa
Excise Act is not analogous to that of a Customs Officer for two reasons. One is that the Excise
Officer, does not exercise any judicial powers just as the Customs Officer does under the Sea
Customs Act, 1878. Secondly, the Customs Officer is not deemed to be an officer in charge of a
police station and therefore can exercise no powers under the Code of Criminal Procedure and
certainly not those of an officer in charge of a police station. No doubt, he too has
the power to make a search, to seize articles suspected to have been smuggled and arrest
The surest way t legal research!"
persons suspected of having committed an offence under the Sea Customs Act. But that is all.
Though he can make an enquiry, he has no power to investigate into an offence under section
156 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. Whatever powers he exercises are expressly set out in
the Sea Customs Act. Though some of those set out in Chapter XVII may be analogous to those
of a Police Officer under the Code of Criminal Procedure they are not identical with those of a
police officer and are not derived from or by reference to the Code. In regard to certain matters,
he does not possess powers even analogous to those of a Police Officer. Thus he is not entitled to
submit a report to a Magistrate under section 190 of the Code of Criminal Procedure with a view
that cognizance of the offence be taken by the Magistrate. Section 187(A) of the Sea Customs
Act specifically provides that cognizance of an offence under the Sea Customs Act can be taken
only upon a complaint in writing made by the Customs Officers or other officer of the customs
not below the rank of an Assistant Collector of Customs authorised in this behalf by the Chief
Customs Officer.
(ii) It may well be that a statute confers powers and imposes duties on a public servant, some
of which are analogous to those of a police officer. But by reason of the nature of other duties
which he is required to perform he may be exercising various other powers also. It is argued on
behalf of the State that where such is the case the mere conferral of some only of the powers of
a police officer on such a person would not make him a police officer and, therefore, what must
be borne in mind is the sum total of the powers which he enjoys by virtue of his office as also
the dominant purpose for which he is appointed. The contention thus is that when an officer has
to perform a wide range of duties and exercise correspondingly a wide range of powers, the mere
fact that some of the powers which the statute confers upon him are analogous to or even
identical with those of a police officer would not make him a police officer and, therefore, if such
an officer records a confession it would not be hit by section 25 of the Evidence Act. In our
judgment what is pertinent to bear in mind for the purpose of determining as to who can be
regarded a 'police officer' for the purpose of this provision is not the totality of the powers which
an officer enjoys but the kind of powers which the law enables him to exercise. The test for
determining whether such a person is a 'police officer' for the purpose of section 25 of the
Evidence Act would, in our judgment, be whether the powers of a police officer which are
conferred on him or which are exercisable by him because he is deemed to be an officer in
charge of police station establish a direct or substantial relationship with the prohibition enacted
by section 25, that is, the recording of a confession. In other words, the test would be whether
the powers are such as would tend to facilitate the obtaining by him of a confession from a
suspect or delinquent. If they do, then it is unnecessary to consider the dominant purpose for
which he is appointed or the question as to what other powers he enjoys. These questions may
perhaps be relevant for consideration where the powers of the police officer conferred upon him
are of a very limited character and are not by themselves sufficient to facilitate the obtaining by
him of a confession." (emphasis supplied)
166. Again, in the case of Badaku Joti Svant (supra), the Constitution Bench of this court held
that a Central Excise Officer exercising power under Central Excise and Salt Act, 1944 is not a
police officer as he does not possess the power to submit a charge-sheet under section 173 of the
1973 Code. The court noted thus
"(9). It is urged that under sub-section (2) of section 21 a Central Excise Officer under the
Act has all the powers of an officer- in-charge of a police station under Chapter XIV of the Cr. P.
C. and, therefore, he must be deemed to be a police officer within the meaning of those words in
section 25 of the Evidence Act. It is true that sub-section (2) confers on the Central Excise
Officer under the Act the same powers as an officer-in-charge of a police station has when
investigating a cognizable case ; but this power is conferred for the purpose of sub-section (1)
which gives power to a Central Excise Officer to whom any arrested person is forwarded to
inquire into the charge against him. Thus under section 21 it is the duty of the Central Excise
Officer to whom an arrested person is forwarded to inquire into the charge made against such
person. Further under proviso (a) to sub-section (2) of section 21 if the Central Excise Officer is
of opinion that there is sufficient evidence or reasonable ground of suspicion against the accused
person, he shall either admit him to bail to appear before a Magistrate having jurisdiction in the
case, or forward him in custody to such Magistrate. It does not, however, appear that a Central
Excise Officer under the Act has power to submit a charge-sheet under section 173 of the Cr. P.
C. Under section 190 of the Cr. P. C. a Magistrate can take cognizance of any offence either (a)
upon receiving a
complaint of facts which constitute such offence, or (b) upon a report in writing of such facts
made by any police officer, or (c) upon information received from any person other than a police
officer, or upon his own knowledge or suspicion, that such offence has been committed. A police
officer for purposes of clause (b) above can in our opinion only be a police officer properly so-
called as the scheme of the Code of Criminal Procedure shows and it seems therefore that a
Central Excise Officer will have to make a complaint under clause (a) above if he wants the
Magistrate to take cognizance of an offence, for example, under section 9 of the Act. Thus
though under sub-section (2) of section 21 the Central Excise Officer under the Act has the
powers of an officer-in-charge of a police station when investigating a cognizable case, that is for
the purpose of his inquiry under sub-section (1) of section 21. Section 21 is in terms different
from section 78(3) of the Bihar and Orissa Excise Act, 1915 which came to be considered in Raja
Ram Jaiswal's case (supra) and which provided in terms that "for the purposes of section 156 of
the Cr. P. C., 1898, the area to which an excise officer empowered under section 77, sub-section
(2), is appointed shall be deemed to be a police station, and such officer shall be deemed to be
the officer-in-charge of such station". It cannot therefore be said that the provision in section 21
is on par with the provision in section 78(3) of the Bihar and Orissa Excise Act. All that section
21 provides is that for the purpose of his enquiry, a Central Excise Officer shall have the powers
of an officer-in-charge of a police station when investigating a cognizable case. But even so it
appears that these powers do not include the power to submit a charge-sheet under section 173
of the Cr. P. C., for unlike the Bihar and Orissa Excise Act, the Central Excise Officer is not
deemed to be an officer-in-charge of a police station."
167. Another Constitution Bench of this court in Ramesh Chandra Mehta (supra) concluded that
a Customs Officer under the Sea Customs Act, 1878 could not be coined as a police officer and
noted thus :
"
The Customs Officer does not exercise, when enquiring into a suspected infringement of
the Sea Customs Act, powers of investigation which a police officer may in investigating the
commission of an offence. He is invested with the power to enquire into infringements of the Act
primarily for the purpose of adjudicating forfeiture and penalty. He has no power to investigate
an offence triable by a Magistrate, nor has he the power to submit a report under section 173
of the Code of Criminal Procedure. He can only make a complaint in writing before a
competent Magistrate.
But the test for determining whether an officer of customs is to be deemed a police officer
is whether he is invested with all the powers of a police officer qua investigation of an offence,
including the power to submit a report under section 173 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. It is
not claimed that a Customs Officer exercising power to make an enquiry may submit a report
under section 173 of the Code of Criminal Procedure." (emphasis supplied)
168. The petitioners, however, have pressed into service exposition of this court in the recent
decision in Tofan Singh (supra), which had occasion to deal with the provisions of the NDPS Act
wherein the court held that the designated officer under that Act must be regarded as a police
officer. The court opined that the statement made before him would be violative of protection
guaranteed under article 20(3) of the Constitution. This decision has been rightly distinguished by
the learned Additional Solicitor General on the argument that the conclusion reached in that
judgment is on the basis of the legislative scheme of the NDPS Act, which permitted that
interpretation. However, it is not possible to reach at the same conclusion in respect of the 2002
Act for more than one reason. In this decision, the court first noted that the Act (NDPS Act) under
consideration was a penal statute. In the case of 2002 Act, however, such a view is not possible.
The second aspect which we have repeatedly adverted to, is the special purposes and objects
behind the enactment of the 2002 Act. As per the provisions of the NDPS Act, it permitted both a
regular police officer as well as a designated officer, who is not a defined police officer, to
investigate the offence under that Act. This has resulted in discrimination. Such a situation does
not emerge from the provisions of the 2002 Act. The 2002 Act, on the other hand, authorises only
the authorities referred to in section 48 to investigate/inquire into the matters under the Act in the
manner prescribed therein. The provision inserted in 2005 as section 45(1A) is not to empower the
regular police officers to take cognizance of the offence. On the other hand, it is a provision to
declare that the regular police officer is not competent to take cognizance of offence of money-
laundering, as it can be investigated only by the authorities referred to in section 48 of the 2002
Act. The third aspect which had weighed with the court in Tofan Singh (supra) is that the police
officer investigating an offence under the NDPS Act, the provisions of sections 161 to 164 of the
1973 Code as also section 25 of the Evidence Act, would come into play making the statement
made before them by the accused as inadmissible. Whereas, the investigation into the same
offence was to be done by the designated officer under the NDPS Act, the safeguards contained in
sections 161 to 164 of the 1973 Code and section 25 of the Evidence Act, will have no application
and the statement made before them would be inadmissible in evidence. This had resulted in
discrimination. No such situation emerges from the provisions of the 2002 Act. Whereas, the 2002
Act clearly authorises only the authorities under the 2002 Act referred to in section 48 to step in
and summon the person when occasion arises and proceed to record the statement and take
relevant documents on record. For that, express provision has been made authorising them to do so
and by a legal fiction, deemed it to be a statement recorded in a judicial proceeding by virtue of
section 50(4) of the 2002 Act. A regular police officer will neither be in a position to take
cognizance of the offence of money-laundering, much less be permitted to record the statement
which is to be made part of the proceeding before the Adjudicating Authority under the 2002 Act
for confirmation of the provisional attachment order and confiscation of the proceeds of crime for
eventual vesting in the Central Government. That may entail in civil consequences. It is a different
matter that some material or evidence is made part of the complaint if required to be filed against
the person involved in the process or activity connected with money-laundering so as to prosecute
him for offence punishable under section 3 of the 2002 Act. The next point which has been
reckoned by this court in the said decision is that in the provisions of the NDPS Act, upon
culmination of investigation of crime by a designated officer under that Act (other than a police
officer), he proceeds to file a complaint ; but has no authority to further investigate the offence, if
required. Whereas, if the same offence was investigated by a regular Police Officer after filing of the
police report under section 173(2) of the 1973 Code, he could still do further investigation by
invoking section 173(8) of the 1973 Code. This, on the face of it, was discriminatory.
169. Notably, this dichotomy does not exist in the 2002 Act for more than one reason. For, there
is no role for the regular police officer. The investigation is to be done only by the authorities under
the 2002 Act and upon culmination of the investigation, to file complaint before the Special Court.
Moreover, by virtue of clause (ii) of Explanation to section 44(1) of the 2002 Act, it is open to the
authorities under this Act to bring any further evidence, oral or documentary, against any accused
person involved in respect of offence of money-laundering, for which, a complaint has already been
filed by him or against person not named in the complaint and by legal fiction, such further
complaint is deemed to be part of the complaint originally filed. Strikingly, in Tofan Singh (supra)
the court also noted that, while dealing with the provisions of the NDPS Act, the designated officer
has no express power to file a closure report unlike the power bestowed on the police officer, if he
had investigated the same crime under the NDPS Act. Once again, this lack of authority to file
closure report is not there in the 2002 Act. For, by the virtue of proviso in section 44(1)(b), after
conclusion of investigation, if no offence of money-laundering is made out requiring filing of a
complaint, the Authority under the Act expected to file such complaint, is permitted to file a closure
report before the Special Court in that regard. In that decision, while analysing the provisions of
the section 67 of the NDPS Act, the court noted that the statement recorded under section 67 of
that Act was to be held as inadmissible in all situations. That renders section 53A of the same Act
otiose. Section 53A of the NDPS Act is about relevancy of statement made under certain
circumstances. Realising the conflicting position emerging in the two provisions, the issue came to
be answered.
170. However, in the case of provisions of the 2002 Act, there is no similar provision as section
53A of the NDPS Act. As a result, even this deficiency noticed in that judgment has no application
to the provisions of the 2002 Act. The court also noted in that decision that unlike the provisions of
in the Customs Act, 1962, the Central Excise Act, 1944 and the Railway Property (Unlawful
Possession) Act, 1966, in the case of the NDPS Act prevention, detection and punishment of crime
cannot be said to be ancillary to the purpose of regulating and exercising of control over narcotic
drugs and psychotropic substances.
171. We have already adverted to the purposes and objects for enacting the 2002 Act. It is a sui
generis legislation, not only dealing with the prevention, detection, attachment, confiscation,
vesting and making it obligatory for the banking companies, financial institutions and
intermediaries to comply with certain essential formalities and make them accountable for failure
thereof, and also permits prosecution of the persons found involved in the money-laundering
activity. Keeping in mind the sweep of the purposes and objectives of the 2002 Act, the reason
weighed with this court while dealing with the provisions of the NDPS Act, will have no bearing
whatsoever. In that decision, this court also noted that the offences under the NDPS Act are
cognizable as opposed to other statutes referred to above. The scheme of the NDPS Act, including
regarding making offences under that Act as cognizable by the designated officer as well as the
local police, and the scheme of the 2002 Act is entirely different.
171A. Indeed, in the original 2002 Act, as enacted, the offence of money-laundering was
made cognizable as a result of which confusion had prevailed in dealing with the said crime
when the legislative intent was only to authorise the Authority under the 2002 Act to deal with
such cases. That position stood corrected in 2005, as noticed earlier. The fact that the marginal
note of section 45 retains marginal note that offences to be cognizable and non-bailable,
however, does not mean that the regular police officer is competent to take cognisance of the
offence of money-laundering. Whereas, that description has been retained for the limited
purpose of understanding that the offence of money-laundering is cognisable and non-bailable
and can be inquired into and investigated by the Authority under the 2002 Act alone.
172. In other words, there is stark distinction between the scheme of the NDPS Act dealt with
by this court in Tofan Singh (supra) and that in the provisions of the 2002 Act under consideration.
Thus, it must follow that the authorities under the 2002 Act are not police officers. Ex-consequenti,
the statements recorded by the authorities under the 2002 Act, of persons involved in the
commission of the offence of money-laundering or the witnesses for the purposes of
inquiry/investigation, cannot be hit by the vice of article 20(3) of the Constitution or for that
matter, article 21 being procedure established by law. In a given case, whether the protection
given to the accused who is being prosecuted for the offence of money-laundering, of section 25 of
the Evidence Act is available or not, may have to be considered on case-to-case basis being rule of
evidence.
173. We may note that the learned Additional Solicitor General was at pains to persuade us to
take the view that the decision in Tofan Singh (supra) is per incuriam. For the reasons already
noted, we do not deem it necessary to examine that argument.
Section 63 of the 2002 Act
174. By this provision, penal consequences are provided in respect of acts of commission and
omission by any person who wilfully and maliciously gives false information and so causing an
arrest or a search under this Act ; also against the person legally bound to state the truth of any
matter relating to an offence under section 3, but refuses to answer such any question put to him
by the Authority under the 2002 Act or refuses to sign any statement made by him in the course of
any proceedings under the Act including failure to attend or produce books of account or
documents when called upon to do so. Section 63 reads thus :
" Punishment for false information or failure to give information, etc.-(1) Any person
wilfully and maliciously giving false information
and so causing an arrest or a search to be made under this Act shall on conviction be liable for
imprisonment for a term which may extend to two years or with fine which may extend to fifty
thousand rupees or both.
(2) If any person,
(a) being legally bound to state the truth of any matter relating to an offence under section
3, refuses to answer any question put to him by an authority in the exercise of its powers
under this Act ; or
(b) refuses to sign any statement made by him in the course of any proceedings under this
Act, which an authority may legally require to sign ; or
(c) to whom a summon is issued under section 50 either to attend to give evidence or
produce books of account or other documents at a certain place and time, omits to attend or
produce books of account or documents at the place or time,
he shall pay, by way of penalty, a sum which shall not be less than five hundred rupees but
which may extend to ten thousand rupees for each such default or failure.
(3) No order under this section shall be passed by an authority referred to in sub-section (2)
unless the person on whom the penalty is proposed to be imposed is given an opportunity of
being heard in the matter by such authority.
*(4) Notwithstanding anything contained in clause (c) of sub-section (2), a person who
intentionally disobeys any direction issued under section 50 shall also be liable to be proceeded
against under section 174 of the Indian Penal Code (45 of 1860).
This provision is only an enabling provision and applies to situations referred to therein. It is
in the nature of providing consequences for not discharging the burden or co-operating with the
authorities during the proceedings before the Authority and pursuant to summons, production of
documents and to give evidence is issued by such Authority in exercise of power under section
50 of the 2002 Act. The power exercised by the Authority is analogous to power vested in a civil
court under the 1908 Code while trying a suit in respect of matters referred to in section 50 of
the 2002 Act. This is in the nature of deeming provision empowering the concerned Authority to
ensure prevention of money-laundering and also to take consequential steps for attachment and
confiscation of the property involved in such money-laundering to be vested in the Central
Government. Absent

such authority given to the Director under the 2002 Act, the inquiry or investigation required
to be done for fulfilling the mandate predicated under the 2002 Act, would eventually result in
paper inquiry and no meaningful purpose would be served much less to combat the menace of
money-laundering. In such inquiry if misleading revelations are made by any person or for that
matter fails to co-operate, is required to be proceeded in accordance with law. In that sense,
section 63 is the procedure established by law. It is unfathomable to countenance the argument
that such a provision must be regarded as unreasonable or manifestly arbitrary. It has clear
nexus with the purposes and objects sought to be achieved by the 2002 Act.
Schedule of the 2002 Act
175. The expression "scheduled offence" has been defined in section 2(1)(y). This provision
assumes significance as it has direct link with the definition of "proceeds of crime". In that, the
property derived or obtained as a result of criminal activity relating to notified offences, termed as
scheduled offence, is regarded as tainted property and dealing with such property in any manner is
an offence of money-laundering. The Schedule is in three parts, namely, Parts A, B and C. Part A of
the Schedule consists of 29 paragraphs. These paragraphs deal with respective enactments and the
offences specified thereunder which are regarded as scheduled offences. Similarly, Part B deals with
offence under the Customs Act specifically and Part C is in relation to offence of cross border
implications. The Schedule reads thus :

# # (4) The offence of wilful attempt to evade any tax, penalty or interest referred to in

This Schedule has been amended by Act 21 of 2009, Act 2 of 2013, Act 22 of 2015, Act 13 of
2018 and Act 16 of 2018, thereby inserting new offences to be regarded as scheduled offence.
The challenge is not on the basis of legislative competence in respect of enactment of Schedule
and the amendments thereto from time to time. However, it had been urged before us that there
is no consistency in the approach as it includes even minor offences as scheduled offence for the
purposes of offence of money-laundering, more so even offences which have no trans-border
implications and are compoundable between the parties. The classification or grouping of
offences for treating the same as relevant for constituting offence of money-laundering is a
matter of legislative policy. Parliament in its wisdom has regarded the property derived or
obtained as a result of specified criminal activity, being an offence under the concerned
legislation mentioned in the Schedule. The fact that some of the offences may be non-cognizable
offences under the concerned legislation or regarded as minor and compoundable offences, yet,
Parliament in its wisdom having perceived
# Inserted by Act 21 of 2009, section 13(iii) (w.e.f. 1-6-2009).
# # Omitted by Act 2 of 2013, section 30(iii) (w.e.f. 15-2-2013, vide S. O. 343(E), dated 8-2-

# # # Inserted by Act 22 of 2015, section 88 (w.e.f. 1-7-2015, vide S. O. 1790(E), dated 1st
July,2015).
the cumulative effect of the process or activity concerning the proceeds of crime generated
from such criminal activities as being likely to pose threat to the economic stability, sovereignty
and integrity of the country and thus, grouped them together for reckoning it as an offence of
money-laundering, is a matter of legislative policy. It is not open to the court to have a second
guess at such a policy.
175A. Needless to underscore that the 2002 Act is intended to initiate action in respect of
money-laundering activity which necessarily is associated with the property derived or obtained
by any person, directly or indirectly, as a result of specified criminal activity. The prosecution
under this Act is not in relation to the criminal activity per se but limited to property derived or
obtained from specified criminal activity. Resultantly, the inclusion of criminal activity which has
been regarded as non-cognizable, compoundable or minor offence under the concerned
legislation, should have no bearing to answer the matter in issue. In that, the offence of money-
laundering is an independent offence and the persons involved in the commission of such
offence are grouped together as offenders under this Act. There is no reason to make distinction
between them in so far as the offence of money-laundering is concerned. In our opinion,
therefore, there is no merit in the argument under consideration.
ECIR vis-a-vis FIR
176. As per the procedure prescribed by the 1973 Code, the officer in-charge of a police station
is under an obligation to record the information relating to the commission of a cognizable offence,
in terms of section 154 of the 1973 Code*. There is no corresponding provision in the 2002 Act
requiring registration of offence of money-laundering. As noticed earlier, the mechanism for
proceeding against the property being proceeds of crime predicated in the 2002 Act is a sui generis
procedure. No comparison can be drawn between the mechanism regarding prevention,
investigation or trial in connection with the scheduled offence governed by the provisions of the
1973 Code. In the scheme of 2002 Act upon identification of existence of property being proceeds
of crime, the Authority under this Act is expected to inquire into relevant aspects in relation to such
property and take measures as may be necessary and specified in the 2002 Act including to attach
the property for being dealt with as per the provisions of the 2002 Act. We have elaborately
adverted to the procedure to be followed by the authorities for such attachment of the property
being proceeds of crime and the follow-up steps of confiscation upon confirmation of the provisional
attachment order by the Adjudicating Authority. For facilitating the Adjudicating Authority to
confirm the provisional attachment order and direct confiscation, the authorities under the 2002 Act
(i. e., section 48) are expected to make an inquiry and investigate. Incidentally, when sufficient
The surest way't legal research!"
credible information is gathered by the authorities during such inquiry/ investigation indicative of
involvement of any person in any process or activity connected with the proceeds of crime, it is
open to such authorities to file a formal complaint before the Special Court naming the concerned
person for offence of money-laundering under section 3 of this Act. Considering the scheme of the
2002 Act, though the offence of money-laundering is otherwise regarded as cognizable offence
(cognizance whereof can be taken only by the authorities referred to in section 48 of this Act and
not by jurisdictional police) and punishable under section 4 of the 2002 Act, special complaint
procedure is prescribed by law. This procedure overrides the procedure prescribed under 1973 Code
to deal with other offences (other than money-laundering offences) in the matter of registration of
offence and inquiry/investigation thereof. This special procedure must prevail in terms of section 71
of the 2002 Act and also keeping in mind section 65 of the same Act. In other words, the offence of
money-laundering cannot be registered by the jurisdictional police who is governed by the regime
under Chapter XII of the 1973 Code. The provisions of Chapter XII of the 1973 Code do not apply
in all respects to deal with information derived relating to commission of money-laundering offence
much less investigation thereof. The dispensation regarding prevention of money-laundering,
attachment of proceeds of crime and inquiry/investigation of offence of money-laundering up to
filing of the complaint in respect of offence under section 3 of the 2002 Act is fully governed by the
provisions of the 2002 Act itself. To wit, regarding survey, searches, seizures, issuing summons,
recording of statements of concerned persons and calling upon production of documents,
inquiry/investigation, arrest of persons involved in the offence of money-laundering including bail
and attachment, confiscation and vesting of property being proceeds of crime. Indeed, after arrest,
the manner of dealing with such offender involved in offence of money-laundering would then be
governed by the provisions of the 1973 Code-as there are no inconsistent provisions in the 2002
Act in regard to production of the arrested person before the jurisdictional Magistrate within twenty
-four hours and also filing of the complaint before the Special Court within the statutory period
prescribed in the 1973 Code for filing of police report, if not released on bail before expiry thereof.
177. Suffice it to observe that being a special legislation providing for special mechanism
regarding inquiry/investigation of offence of money-laundering, analogy cannot be drawn from the
provisions of 1973 Code, in regard to registration of offence of money-laundering and more so
being a complaint procedure prescribed under the 2002 Act. Further, the authorities referred to in
section 48 of the 2002 Act alone are competent to file such complaint. It is a different matter that
the materials/evidence collected by the same authorities for the purpose of civil action of
attachment of proceeds of crime and confiscation thereof may be used to prosecute the person
involved in the process or activity connected with the proceeds of crime for offence of money-
laundering. Considering the mechanism of inquiry/investigation for proceeding against the property
(being proceeds of crime) under this Act by way of civil action (attachment and confiscation), there
is no need to formally register an ECIR, unlike registration of an FIR by the jurisdictional police in
respect of cognizable offence under the ordinary law. There is force in the stand taken by the ED
that ECIR is an internal document created by the department before initiating penal action or
prosecution against the person involved with process or activity connected with proceeds of crime.
Thus, ECIR is not a statutory document, nor there is any provision in 2002 Act requiring Authority
referred to in section 48 to record ECIR or to furnish copy thereof to the accused unlike section 154
of the 1973 Code. The fact that such ECIR has not been recorded, does not come in the way of the
authorities referred to in section 48 of the 2002 Act to commence inquiry/investigation for initiating
civil action of attachment of property being proceeds of crime by following prescribed procedure in
that regard.
178. The next issue is : whether it is necessary to furnish copy of ECIR to the person concerned
apprehending arrest or at least after his arrest ? section 19(1) of the 2002 Act postulates that after
arrest, as soon as may be, the person should be informed about the grounds for such arrest. This
stipulation is compliant with the mandate of article 22(1) of the Constitution. Being a special
legislation and considering the complexity of the inquiry/investigation both for the purposes of
initiating civil action as well as prosecution, non-supply of ECIR in a given case cannot be faulted.
The ECIR may contain details of the material in possession of the Authority and recording
satisfaction of reason to believe that the person is guilty of money-laundering offence, if revealed
before the inquiry/ investigation required to proceed against the property being proceeds of crime
including to the person involved in the process or activity connected therewith, may have
deleterious impact on the final outcome of the inquiry/investigation. So long as the person has
been informed about grounds of his arrest that is sufficient compliance of mandate of article 22(1)
of the Constitution. Moreover, the arrested person before being produced before the Special Court
within twenty-four hours or for that purposes of remand on each occasion, the court is free to look
into the relevant records made available by the Authority about the involvement of the arrested
person in the offence of money-laundering. In any case, upon filing of the complaint before the
statutory period provided in 1973 Code, after arrest, the person would get all relevant materials
forming part of the complaint filed by the Authority under section 44(1)(b) of the 2002 Act before
the Special Court.
179. Viewed thus, supply of ECIR in every case to person concerned is not mandatory. From the
submissions made across the Bar, it is noticed that in some cases ED has furnished copy of ECIR to
the person before filing of the complaint. That does not mean that in every case same procedure
must be followed. It is enough, if ED at the time of arrest, contemporaneously discloses the
grounds of such arrest to such person. Suffice it to observe that ECIR cannot be equated with an
FIR which is mandatorily required to be recorded and supplied to the accused as per the provisions
of 1973 Code. Revealing a copy of an ECIR, if made mandatory, may defeat the purpose sought to
be achieved by the 2002 Act including frustrating the attachment of property (proceeds of crime).
Non-supply of ECIR, which is essentially an internal document of ED, cannot be cited as violation of
constitutional right. Concededly, the person arrested, in terms of section 19 of the 2002 Act, is
contemporaneously made aware about the grounds of his arrest. This is compliant with the
mandate of article 22(1) of the Constitution. It is not unknown that at times FIR does not reveal all
aspects of the offence in question. In several cases, even the names of persons actually involved in
the commission of offence are not mentioned in the FIR and described as unknown accused. Even,
the particulars as unfolded are not fully recorded in the FIR. Despite that, the accused named in
any ordinary offence is able to apply for anticipatory bail or regular bail, in which proceeding, the
police papers are normally perused by the concerned court. On the same analogy, the argument of
prejudice pressed into service by the petitioners for non-supply of ECIR deserves to be answered
against the petitioners. For, the arrested person for offence of money-laundering
is
contemporaneously informed about the grounds of his arrest ; and when produced before the
Special Court, it is open to the Special Court to call upon the representative of ED to produce
relevant record con
cerning the case of the accused before him and look into the same for answering the need for his
continued detention. Taking any view of the matter, therefore, the argument under consideration
does not take the matter any further.
ED Manual
180. It had been urged that the 2002 Act creates an overbroad frame with no fetters on
investigation. Besides questioning the refusal to furnish copy of ECIR, grievance is also made about
the opacity surrounding the usage of ED Manual. Relying on section 4(b)(v) of the RTI Act, it was
urged that it was obligatory on the part of the Public Authority to publish the stated Manual within
120 days of the enactment of the RTI Act. All other authorities including the Central Vigilance
Commission, Income-tax Authorities, Authorities under 1962 Act, Police Authorities, Jail Authorities
have adhered to this statutory compliance, except the ED. In response, it is submitted by the
learned Additional Solicitor General that ED Manual is an internal departmental document only for
the use of officers of the ED. It is to give them guidance on proper enforcement of 2002 Act and
outlines the procedure for implementation of the provisions of this Act. In addition, reliance is
placed on the exposition of the Constitution Bench of this court in Lalita Kumari (supra). In
paragraph 89 of this decision, the court observed thus
"89. Besides, the learned senior counsel relied on the special procedures prescribed under the
CBI Manual to be read into section 154. It is true that the concept of 'preliminary inquiry' is
contained in Chapter IX of the Crime Manual of CBI. However, this Crime Manual is not a statute
and has not been enacted by the Legislature. It is a set of administrative orders issued for
internal guidance of the CBI officers. It cannot supersede the Code. Moreover, in the absence of
any indication to the contrary in the Code itself, the provisions of the CBI Crime Manual cannot
be relied upon to import the concept of holding of preliminary inquiry in the scheme of the Code
of Criminal Procedure. At this juncture, it is also pertinent to submit that CBI is constituted
under a special Act, namely, the Delhi Special Police Establishment Act, 1946 and it derives its
power to investigate from this Act."
181. It is true that the ED Manual may be an internal document for departmental use and in the
nature of set of administrative orders. It is equally true that the accused or for that matter common
public may not be entitled to have access to such administrative instructions being highly
confidential and dealing with complex issues concerning mode and manner of investigation, for
internal guidance of officers of ED. It is also correct to say that there is no such requirement under
the 2002 Act or for that matter, that there is nothing like investigation of a crime of money-
laundering as per the scheme of 2002 Act. The investigation, however, is to track the property
being proceeds of crime and to attach the same for being dealt with under the 2002 Act. Stricto
sensu, it is in the nature of an inquiry in respect of civil action of attachment. Nevertheless, since
the inquiry in due course ends in identifying the offender who is involved in the process or activity
connected with the proceeds of crime and then to prosecute him, it is possible for the department
to outline the situations in which that course could be adopted in reference to specific provisions of
2002 Act or the Rules framed thereunder ; and in which event, what are the options available to
such person before the Authority or the Special Court, as the case may be. Such document may
come handy and disseminate information to all concerned. At least the feasibility of placing such
document on the official website of ED may be explored.
Appellate Tribunal
182. Serious grievance has been made about the vacancies in the Appellate Tribunal despite the
serious prejudice being caused on account of provisional attachment order and, in some cases,
taking over possession of the property so attached. This grievance, even though genuine, cannot be
the basis to test the validity of the provisions of the 2002 Act or to question the efficacy of those
provisions on that account. Parliament by this special legislation having created an expert body
being Appellate Tribunal to deal with matters concerning attachment, possession and confiscation
and vesting of property in the Central Government, it is, but necessary, that the forum should be
functional and accessible to the aggrieved persons uninterruptedly. We need to impress upon the
Executive to take necessary corrective measures in this regard. Absent such forum, the aggrieved
persons have to rush to the High Court on every occasion which indeed is avoidable.
Punishment under section 4 of the 2002 Act
183. It is urged that there is no gradation of punishment depending on the nature of offence
which may be committed by the principal offender and other offenders. Section 4* of the 2002 Act
makes no distinction between person directly involved in the process or activity connected with the
proceeds of crime and the other not so directly involved. Further, the scheduled offence may have
been committed by someone else and the
*
4. Punishment for money-laundering.-Whoever commits the offence of money-launderingshall
be punishable with rigorous imprisonment for a term which shall not beless than three years but
which may extend to seven years and shall also be liable tofine Provided that where
the
proceeds of crime involved in money-laundering relates to anyoffence specified under paragraph 2
of Part A of the Schedule, the provisions of this sectionshall have effect as if for the words "which
may extend to seven years", the words"which may extend to ten years" had been
substituted. The words "which may extend to five lakhs rupees" omitted by Act 2 of 2013, section
4(w.e.f. 15-2-2013, vide S. O. 343(E), dated 8-2-2013).
offence of money-laundering by third person owing to being involved in the process or activity
connected with the proceeds of crime. The petitioners have relied on sections 201 and 212 of the
IPC. It is their case that this distinction is absent in section 4 of the 2002 Act which provides that
the term of rigorous imprisonment shall not be less than three years and extend up to seven years
or ten years, as the case may be, with fine. This argument to say the least is flimsy and tenuous.
For, the punishment under section 4 is not in relation to the predicate offence, but offence of
money- laundering under section 3 of the 2002 Act. The person may be involved in any one or
more than one process or activity connected with the proceeds of crime. All of them are treated as
one class of offender involved in money-laundering. The proceeds of crime may be derived or
obtained as a result of criminal activity with which the offender involved in money-laundering
offence may not be directly concerned at all. Even so, he becomes liable to be proceeded under
section 3 and punished under section 4 of the 2002 Act. The principle of an accessory after the fact
will have no application to the offence of money-laundering. Suffice it to observe that the argument
under consideration is devoid of merit.
184. On the basis of same analogy, it was argued that the twin conditions of bail contained in
section 45 of the 2002 Act would act grossly disproportionate and illogical qua a person who is not
directly connected with the scheduled offence but merely an accessory after the fact. Even this
argument needs to be stated to be rejected for the same reason.
185. The above analysis, in our view, is sufficient to answer the diverse issues canvassed before
us. We have attempted to extensively deal with the essential aspects to record our conclusion issue
-wise. Further, we do not wish to dissect every reported decision cited before us to obviate
prolixity.
186. We once again clarify that in this judgment, we have confined our analysis only to the
issues regarding the validity and interpretation of the provisions of the 2002 Act, referred to above.
We have not dealt with any other issue involved in individual cases concerning 2002 Act as the
parties have been given liberty to pursue their other remedies before appropriate forum.
Furthermore, we have delinked the matters pertaining to other legislations and issues arising
therefrom from this batch of cases, for being proceeded appropriately.
Conclusion
187. In light of the above analysis, we now proceed to summarise our conclusion on seminal
points in issue in the following terms
(i) The question as to whether some of the amendments to the Prevention of Money-laundering Act,
2002 could not have been enacted by the Parliament by way of a Finance Act has not been
examined in this judgment. The same is left open for being examined along with or after the
decision of the larger Bench (seven judges) of this court in the case of Rojer Mathew (supra).
(ii) The expression "proceedings" occurring in clause (na) of section 2(1) of the 2002 Act is
contextual and is required to be given expansive meaning to include inquiry procedure followed
by the Authorities of ED, the Adjudicating Authority, and the Special Court.
(iii) The expression "investigation" in clause (na) of section 2(1) of the 2002 Act does not
limit itself to the matter of investigation concerning the offence under the Act and is
interchangeable with the function of "inquiry" to be undertaken by the Authorities under the Act.
(iv) The Explanation inserted to clause (u) of section 2(1) of the 2002 Act does not travel
beyond the main provision predicating tracking and reaching up to the property derived or
obtained directly or indirectly as a result of criminal activity relating to a scheduled offence.
(v) (a) Section 3 of the 2002 Act has a wider reach and captures every process and activity,
direct or indirect, in dealing with the proceeds of crime and is not limited to the happening of
the final act of integration of tainted property in the formal economy. The Explanation inserted to
section 3 by way of amendment of 2019 does not expand the purport of section 3 but is only
clarificatory in nature. It clarifies the word "and" preceding the expression projecting or claiming
as "or" ; and being a clarificatory amendment, it would make no difference even if it is
introduced by way of Finance Act or otherwise.
(b) Independent of the above, we are clearly of the view that the expression "and" occurring
in
section 3 has to be construed as "or", to give full play to the said provision so as to include
"every" process or activity indulged into by anyone. Projecting or claiming the property as
untainted
property would constitute an offence of money-laundering on its own, being an independent
process or activity.
(c) The interpretation suggested by the petitioners, that only upon projecting or claiming the
property in question as untainted property that the offence of section 3 would be complete,
stands rejected.
(d) The offence under section 3 of the 2002 Act is dependent on illegal gain of property as a
result of criminal activity relating to a scheduled offence. It is concerning the process or activity
connected with such property, which constitutes the offence of money-laundering. The
Authorities under the 2002 Act cannot prosecute any person on notional basis or on the
assumption that a scheduled offence has been committed, unless it is so registered with the
jurisdictional police and/or pending enquiry/trial including by way of criminal complaint before
the competent forum. If the person is finally discharged/acquitted of the scheduled offence or
the criminal case against him is quashed by the court of competent jurisdiction, there can be no
offence of money-laundering against him or any one claiming such property being the property
linked to stated scheduled offence through him.
(vi) Section 5 of the 2002 Act is constitutionally valid. It provides for a balancing
arrangement to secure the interests of the person as also ensures that the proceeds of crime
remain available to be dealt with in the manner provided by the 2002 Act. The procedural
safeguards as delineated by us hereinabove are effective measures to protect the interests of
person concerned.
(vii) The challenge to the validity of sub-section (4) of section 8 of the 2002 Act is also
rejected subject to section 8 being invoked and operated in accordance with the meaning
assigned to it hereinabove.
(viii) The challenge to deletion of proviso to sub-section (1) of section 17 of the 2002 Act
stands rejected. There are stringent safeguards provided in section 17 and Rules framed
thereunder. Moreover, the pre-condition in the proviso to rule 3(2) of the 2005 Rules cannot be
read into section 17 after its amendment. The Central Government may take necessary
corrective steps to obviate confusion caused in that regard.
(ix) The challenge to deletion of proviso to sub-section (1) of section 18 of the 2002 Act also
stands rejected. There are similar safeguards provided in section 18. We hold that the amended
provision does not suffer from the vice of arbitrariness.
(x) The challenge to the constitutional validity of section 19 of the 2002 Act is also rejected.
There are stringent safeguards provided in section 19. The provision does not suffer from the
vice of arbitrariness.
(xi) Section 24 of the 2002 Act has reasonable nexus with the purposes and objects sought to
be achieved by the 2002 Act and cannot be regarded as manifestly arbitrary or unconstitutional.
(xii)(a) The proviso in clause (a) of sub-section (1) of section 44 of the 2002 Act is to be
regarded as directory in nature and this provision is also read down to mean that the Special
Court may exercise judicial discretion on case-to-case basis.
(b) We do not find merit in the challenge to section 44 being arbitrary or unconstitutional.
However, the eventualities referred to in this section shall be dealt with by the court concerned
and by the Authority concerned in accordance with the interpretation given in this judgment.
(xiii) (a) The reasons which weighed with this court in Nikesh Tarachand Shah (supra) for
declaring the twin conditions in section 45(1) of the 2002 Act, as it stood at the relevant time,
as unconstitutional in no way obliterated the provision from the statute book ; and it was open
to Parliament to cure the defect noted by this court so as to revive the same provision in the
existing form.
(b) We are unable to agree with the observations in Nikesh Tarachand Shah (supra)
distinguishing the enunciation of the Constitution Bench decision in Kartar Singh (supra) ; and
other observations suggestive of doubting the perception of Parliament in regard to the
seriousness of the offence of money-laundering, including about it posing serious threat to the
sovereignty and integrity of the country.
(c) The provision in the form of section 45 of the 2002 Act, as applicable post amendment of
2018, is reasonable and has direct nexus with the purposes and objects sought to be achieved
by the 2002 Act and does not suffer from the vice of arbitrariness or unreasonableness.
(d) As regards the prayer for grant of bail, irrespective of the nature of proceedings, including
those under section 438 of the 1973 Code or even upon invoking the jurisdiction of
Constitutional Courts, the underlying principles and rigours of section 45 may apply.
(xiv) The beneficial provision of section 436A of the 1973 Code could be invoked by the
accused arrested for offence punishable under the 2002 Act.
(xv)(a) The process envisaged by section 50 of the 2002 Act is in the nature of an inquiry
against the proceeds of crime and is not "investigation" in strict sense of the term for initiating
prosecution ; and the Authorities under the 2002 Act (referred to in section 48), are not police
officers as such.
(b) The statements recorded by the Authorities under the 2002 Act are not hit by article 20
(3) or article 21 of the Constitution of India.
(xvi) Section 63 of the 2002 Act providing for punishment regarding false information or
failure to give information does not suffer from any vice of arbitrariness.
(xvii) The inclusion or exclusion of any particular offence in the Schedule to the 2002 Act is a
matter of legislative policy ; and the nature or class of any predicate offence has no bearing on
the validity of the Schedule or any prescription thereunder.
(xviii)(a) In view of special mechanism envisaged by the 2002 Act, ECIR cannot be equated
with an FIR under the 1973 Code. ECIR is an internal document of the ED and the fact that FIR
in
respect of scheduled offence has not been recorded does not come in the way of the
Authorities referred to in section 48 to commence inquiry/investigation for initiating "civil action"
of "provisional attachment" of property being proceeds of crime.
(b) Supply of a copy of ECIR in every case to the person concerned is not mandatory, it is
enough if ED at the time of arrest, discloses the grounds of such arrest.
(c) However, when the arrested person is produced before the Special Court, it is open to the
Special Court to look into the relevant records presented by the authorised representative of ED
for answering the issue of need for his/her continued detention in connection with the offence of
money-laundering.
(xix) Even when ED manual is not to be published being an internal departmental document
issued for the guidance of the Authorities (ED officials), the department ought to explore the
desirability of placing information on its website which may broadly outline the scope of the
authority of the functionaries under the Act and measures to be adopted by them as also the
options/remedies available to the person concerned before the Authority and before the Special
Court.
(xx) The petitioners are justified in expressing serious concern bordering on causing injustice
owing to the vacancies in the Appellate Tribunal. We deem it necessary to impress upon the
executive to take corrective measures in this regard expeditiously.
(xxi) The argument about proportionality of punishment with reference to the nature of
scheduled offence is wholly unfounded and stands rejected.
