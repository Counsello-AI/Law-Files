proportionate non-remittable sentence of imprisonment

aggravating and mitigating circumstances, to determine the imposition of

guidelines should be laid down, and held that aggravating and mitigating
circumstances could not be rigidly enumerated so as to exclude "all free play
of discretion"
- Discretion afforded to the court in sentencing, is not for it to be Judge-centric

and ought not be seen as one - Rather than applying strict classification of the
type of offences that warrant death sentence, the court must focus on equally
considering the aggravating and mitigating circumstances (in which commonality is
to be drawn across cases), and arrive at individualised sentencing outcomes on a

Held :
An overall analysis of capital punishment cases decided by the Supreme Court
will perhaps reflect that that there is in fact, no pattern. While there are real and
valid concerns in the non-uniform application of the Bachan Singh framework,
discretion in sentencing, in itself - is not worrisome, and the concern needs to be
dispelled. While generally Judges may look to precedents for the comfort of
numbers, that process only gives an indication of how similar instances have been
dealt with and has a limited role when it comes to sentencing. The discretion
afforded to the court in sentencing, is not for it to be Judge-centric or result in
disparate rulings, but in fact to enable the court with the flexibility of considering the
case-specific factors relating to the crime and criminal, without falling into
predetermined patterns. Sentencing is not a mathematical equation and ought not
be seen as one. This has been recognised in numerous cases starting from Bachan
Singh case itself. Rather than applying strict classification of the type of offences
that warrant death sentence, the court must focus on equally considering the
aggravating and mitigating circumstances (in which commonality is to be drawn
across case), and arrive at individualised sentencing outcomes on a case-to-case
basis.
(Paras 228 and 229)
categorise cases under broadly five heads (i.e. manner of commission of murder,
motive, anti-social or socially abhorrent nature of the crime, magnitude of crime,
and personality of victim), by strongly analysing the aggravating circumstances of
the crime. A formalistic reliance on these categories however, has the potential of
leading any court awry as it has the unintended effect of drawing attention away
from the criminal, and focussing disproportionately on the crime.
(Para 221)
categorising cases. Rejecting the contention that standards and guidelines should be
laid down, it was noted in Bachan Singh case that degree of culpability cannot be
measured, and aggravating and mitigating circumstances could not be
rigidly enumerated so as to exclude "all free play of discretion". Reiterating that
criminal cases cannot be categorised as there were infinite, unpredictable and
unforeseen variations, it was held in Bachan Singh case that by such categorisation,
the sentencing process would cease to be judicial, and such standardisation or
sentencing discretion is beyond the court's function. Therefore, it would be befitting
if reliance were placed not solely on those five categories of crimes (which lays
undue emphasis on aggravating circumstances) enumerated in Machhi Singh, and
instead on the two-question test, and the four guiding principles of Bachan Singh
that were succinctly culled out in Machhi Singh.
(Para 222)
The strength of "precedent" and "consistency" is perhaps, therefore, lowest
when it comes to matters of sentencing, as long as it is within the confines of
legality and resulting in "principled sentencing". In other words, the judicial
incongruence when it relates to sentencing, would in fact be a positive indicator,
rather than a negative one, provided it is still within the well-defined contours of
"principled" sentencing.
(Para 230)
For sentencing in capital offences, discretion to arrive at individualised sentences
is encouraged, but must be constrained by the "rarest of rare" principle, wherein the
court considers aggravating circumstances of the crime, and mitigating
circumstances of the criminal (a "liberal and expansive" construction of the latter),
which in turn must inform their consideration of whether the option of life
imprisonment is unquestionably foreclosed owing to an impossibility to reform.
Deviation from this principle i.e. unguided discretion on the other hand, would quite
obviously lead to bad law. Therefore, "individualised, principled sentencing" - based
on both the crime and criminal, with consideration of whether reform or
rehabilitation is achievable (held to be "probable" in Rajendra Pralhadrao Wasnik,
unquestionably foreclosed - should be the only factor of "commonality" that must
be discernible from decisions relating to capital offences. With the creation of a new
sentencing threshold in Swamy Shraddananda (2) case, and later affirmed by a
Constitution Bench in V. Sriharan, of life imprisonment without statutory remission
(i.e. Articles 72 and 161 of the Constitution are still applicable), yet another option
exists, before imposition of death sentence.
(Paras 230, 231 and 233)
enunciated in opinion of Khanna, J., relied on
Mitigating factors in general, rather than excuse or validate the crime
committed, seek to explain the surrounding circumstances of the criminal to enable
the Judge to decide between the death penalty or life imprisonment.
(Para 237)
exercise of its discretion in certain cases, the court shall take into account the
following circumstances:
(1) That the offence was committed under the influence of extreme mental
or emotional disturbance.
(2) The age of the accused. If the accused is young or old, he shall not be
sentenced to death.
(3) The probability that the accused would not commit criminal acts of
violence as would constitute a continuing threat to society.
(4) The probability that the accused can be reformed and rehabilitated.
The State shall by evidence prove that the accused does not satisfy
Conditions (3) and (4) above.
(5) That in the facts and circumstances of the case the accused believed that
he was morally justified in committing the offence.
(6) That the accused acted under the duress or domination of another
person.
(7) That the condition of the accused showed that he was mentally defective
and that the said defect impaired his capacity to appreciate the criminality of his
conduct.
(para 237)
These are hardly exhaustive : subsequently, the Supreme Court in several
judgments has recognised, and considered commutation to life imprisonment, on
grounds such as young age, socio-economic conditions, mental illness, criminal
antecedents, as relevant indicators on the questions of sentence. Many of these
factors reflect demonstrable ability or merely the possibility even, of the accused to
reform [i.e. (3) and (4) of the Bachan Singh list], which make them important
indicators when it comes to sentencing.
(Para 237)
In the absence of an individual's capacity to effectively bring forth mitigating
factors, the burden of eliciting mitigating circumstances is on the court, which has to
consider them liberally and expansively, whereas the responsibility of providing
material to show that the accused is beyond the scope of reform or rehabilitation,
thereby unquestionably foreclosing the option of life imprisonment and making it is
a fit case for imposition of death penalty, is one which falls squarely on the State.
(Para 240)
The court must play a proactive role to record all relevant information at this
stage. Some of the information relating to crime can be culled out from
the phase prior to sentencing hearing. This information would include aspects
relating to the nature, motive and impact of crime, culpability of convict, etc. Quality
of evidence adduced is also a relevant factor. For instance, extent of reliance on
circumstantial evidence or child witness plays an important role in the sentencing
analysis. But what is sorely lacking, in most capital sentencing cases, is information
relating to characteristics and socio-economic background of the offender. The
State's duty is heightened in importance even more so, in the Indian context where
a majority of the accused have a poor or rudimentary level of legal representation.
(Paras 241 to 247)
There is urgent need to ensure that mitigating circumstances are considered at
the trial stage, to avoid slipping into a retributive response to the brutality of the
crime, as is noticeably the situation in a majority of cases reaching the appellate
stage.
(Para 248)
To do this, the trial court must elicit information from the accused and the State,
both. The State, must-for an offence carrying capital punishment-at the
appropriate stage, produce material which is preferably collected beforehand, before
the Sessions Court disclosing psychiatric and psychological evaluation of the
accused. This will help establish proximity (in terms of timeline), to the accused
person's frame of mind (or mental illness, if any) at the time of committing the
crime and offer guidance on mitigating factors (1), (5), (6) and (7) spelled out in
Bachan Singh list-an onus placed squarely on the State-conducting this form of
psychiatric and psychological evaluation close on the heels of commission of the
offence, will provide a baseline for the appellate courts to use for comparison i.e. to
evaluate the progress of the accused towards reformation, achieved during the
incarceration period.
(Para 249)
Next, the State, must in a time-bound manner, collect additional information
pertaining to the accused. An illustrative, but not exhaustive list is as follows:
(a) Age
(b) Early family background (siblings, protection of parents, any history of
violence or neglect)
(c) Present family background (surviving family members, whether married,
has children, etc.)
(d) Type and level of education
(e) Socio-economic background (including conditions of poverty or
deprivation, if any)
(f) Criminal antecedents (details of offence and whether convicted, sentence
served, if any)
(g) Income and the kind of employment (whether none, or temporary or
permanent, etc.);
(h) Other factors such as history of unstable social behaviour, or mental or
psychological ailment(s), alienation of the individual (with reasons, if any), etc.
(para 250)
This information should mandatorily be available to the trial court, at the
sentencing stage. The accused too, should be given the same opportunity to
produce evidence in rebuttal, towards establishing all mitigating circumstances.
(Para 250)
Lastly, information regarding the accused's jail conduct and behaviour, work
done (if any), activities the accused has involved themselves in, and other related
details should be called for in the form of a report from the relevant jail authorities
(i.e. Probation and Welfare Officer, Superintendent of Jail, etc.). If the appeal is
heard after a long hiatus from the trial court's conviction, or the High Court's
confirmation, as the case may be - a fresh report (rather than the one used by the
previous court) from the jail authorities is recommended, for a more exact and
complete understanding of the contemporaneous progress made by the accused, in
the time elapsed. The jail authorities must also include a fresh psychiatric and
psychological report which will further evidence the reformative progress, and
reveal post-conviction mental illness, if any.

E. Penal Code, 1860 - S. 302 - Imposition of death sentence -
Recording of special reasons therefor, held, mandatory - Special reasons
must be such as to compel the court to hold that it is impossible to reform
and rehabilitate the offender after examining the matter with due regard to
the age, character and antecedents of the offender and the circumstances in
which the offence was committed - Criminal Procedure Code, 1973, Ss.
354(3), 235(2), 360 and 361
Held :
Death sentence is ordinarily ruled out and can only be imposed for "special
reasons", as provided in Section 354(3). There is another provision in the 1973
Code which also uses the significant expression "special reason". It is Section 361.
Section 360 of the 1973 Code re-enacts, in substance, Section 562 of the Criminal
Procedure Code, 1898 ("the old Code"). Section 361 which is a new provision in
the 1973 Code makes it mandatory for the court to record "special reasons" for
not applying the provisions of Section 360. Section 361 thus casts a duty upon the
court to apply the provisions of Section 360 wherever it is possible to do so and to
state "special reasons" if it does not do so. In the context of Section 360, the
"special reasons" contemplated by Section 361 of the 1973 Code must be such as
to compel the court to hold that it is impossible to reform and rehabilitate the
offender after examining the matter with due regard to the age, character and
antecedents of the offender and the circumstances in which the offence was
committed. This is some indication by the legislature that reformation and
rehabilitation of offenders and not mere deterrence, are now among the foremost
objects of the administration of criminal justice in our country.
(Para 236)
Section 361 and Section 354(3) of the 1973 Code have both entered the
statute-book at the same time and they are part of the emerging picture of
acceptance by the legislature of the new trends in criminology. It would not,
therefore, be wrong to assume that the personality of the offender as revealed by
his age, character, antecedents and other circumstances and the tractability of the
offender to reform must necessarily play the most prominent role in determining
the sentence to be awarded. Special reasons must have some relation to these
factors. Criminal justice deals with complex human problems and diverse human
beings. A Judge has to balance the personality of the offender with the
circumstances, situations and the reactions and choose the appropriate sentence to
be imposed.
(Para 236)
F. Criminal Procedure Code, 1973 - S. 235(2) - Sentencing hearing
contemplated under - Held, is not confined merely to oral hearing but
intended to afford a real opportunity to the prosecution as well as the
accused, to place on record facts and material relating to various factors on
the question of sentence and if interested by either side, to have evidence
adduced to show mitigating circumstances to impose a lesser sentence or
aggravating grounds to impose death penalty

sentence - Public opinion - Irrelevance of, in determining sentence -
Commutation to life imprisonment of a minimum term by considering
mitigating factors - Death sentence of all three accused, commuted to life
imprisonment for a minimum term of 25 yrs
- Appellants held guilty of killing three defenceless women of different age
groups (22, 46, 76 yrs) in their own home - Held, though crime in itself, could be
characterised as "extremely brutal, grotesque, diabolical, revolting or dastardly
manner so as to arouse intense and extreme indignation of the community", but
the young age of the accused at the time of the incident (35, 20, 22 respectively)
and lack of criminal antecedents (except in the case of appellant M, who was
allegedly involved in a case of petty theft) cannot be lost sight of - Further, the
prosecution case found silent on any real motive that may have instigated or
moved the three accused to have preplanned for the commission of murder other
than robbery, itself - This coupled with the fact that appellant R was shot in his leg
during the commission of the crime, indicates that perhaps it is reasonable to
assume that they were amateurs in a robbing-gone-wrong situation, who were not
intent on taking the lives of these three women
- As per reports received from the Superintendent of Jail, each of the three
appellants found having a record of overall good conduct in prison and displayed
inclination to reform

hearing as required under S. 235(2) CrPC by trial court

nor the criminal, and the courts must exercise judicial restraint and play a balancing
role - Hence, in the overall interests of justice, death sentence of all three accused,
commuted to life imprisonment for a minimum term of 25 yrs
Held :
The crime in itself, in the present case, could no doubt be characterised as
"extremely brutal, grotesque, diabolical, revolting or dastardly manner SO as to
arouse intense and extreme indignation of the community".
(Para 253)
However, the mitigating circumstances need to be considered (and that too,
liberally and expansively).
(Para 254)
Firstly, accused M's conduct appears to be disciplined, correctional in nature and
overall satisfactory, barring one physical altercation during an earlier confinement
period. He has a wife and two young children with whom he has repaired relations
and is regularly in touch with. He makes special effort to be a part of his growing
children's lives, demonstrating strong continued family ties. While in prison, owing to
his interest in cricket, he has also taken up the responsibility of being the Captain of
the Jail Block team. The Probation Officer concludes that he seems remorseful, and
keen to reintegrate into society with his family.
(Para 256)
The report received from the Superintendent of Jail indicates that accused R too
was involved in an altercation with another inmate in his previous confinement
period, but his overall conduct appears to be normal, and correctional in nature. He
has been voluntarily working as a health worker (based on his request) since 5-1-
2021 wherein he helps transport sick inmates to the Jail Hospital. While in prison, he
has completed 12th standard education, and proceeded to pursue BCom from
IGNOU, New Delhi (in his final year). He actively participates in cultural and spiritual
programmes conducted in the prison. His family consists of his ailing father, mother,
and three married sisters. He expressed concern for his old parents and wished to
help them financially by rejoining society.
(Para 257)
Prison record of third accused N reflects that she had, on a few occasions, got
into fights and exchanged abuses with the other female inmates, and lady guard
officers in the jail. After counselling, however, her conduct has improved and was
found to be disciplined and corrective in nature. While in prison, she actively
participates in cultural programmes, has undergone training for embroidery, knitting
and lamination. In 2017, she received a national award for Jardosi work in Indore
District Court and has received numerous other accolades for her participation in
activities. In prison, she teaches children of other female inmates. Before detention,
she was pursuing her BCom degree, which she completed in prison. Her family
consists of her parents and two married brothers (of which one, is paralysed), who
she is regularly in touch with.
(Para 258)
It is unfortunate to note that both the trial court, and the High Court, failed to
provide an effective sentencing hearing to the accused, at the relevant stage, which
is a right under Section 235(2) CrPC recognised by the Supreme Court in several
cases. In fact, it was argued by the accused that the trial court in contravention of
the Supreme Court's judgments, had proceeded to hear on sentencing almost
immediately, depriving the accused of the opportunity to put forth their case for a
less stringent sentence. The trial court order on sentencing, records in passing -
the plea of "young age" and "socio-economic factors" as mitigating circumstances,
but reflects, at best, a mechanical consideration of the same. Swayed by the
brutality of the crime and "shock of the collective and judicial conscience", the High
Court affirmed imposition of the death penalty solely on the basis of the
aggravating circumstances of the crime, with negligible consideration of mitigating
circumstances of the criminal. This is in direct contravention of Bachan Singh,
(Para 259)
The crime that the appellants have been held guilty of, is heinous; its execution
was vicious and cruel, by any stretch of imagination. The deception practised by the
appellants, in entering the flat, and, when encountering resistance, attacking the
three women, was calculated and ruthless. The repeated stabbings of two of the
deceased, almost in a frenzy, on the one hand, and the defenceless state of the
victims, on the other, highlights that the accused were willing to go ahead with their
plans (of robbing) after eliminating the women of three generations. No doubt, two
of the victims appear to have put up resistance, if one looks at the stab wounds
inflicted all over their bodies, including on their arms and faces. Yet, they were
unarmed and weak.
(Para 260)
At the same time, the young age of the accused at the time of the incident (35,
20, 22 respectively) and lack of criminal antecedents (except in the case of M, who
was allegedly involved in a case of petty theft) cannot be lost sight of. Further, the
prosecution case is silent on any real motive that may have instigated or moved
the three accused to have preplanned for the commission of murden - other than
robbery, itself. This coupled with the fact that R was shot in his leg during the
commission of the crime, indicates that perhaps it is reasonable to assume that
they were amateurs in a robbing-gone-wrong situation, who were not intent on
taking the lives of these three women. One can surmise that having ventured to
rob, perhaps they did not contemplate the kind of resistance that was put up by the
victims, which led them to act the way they did, to continue with their plan, and
ensure that the victims did not survive to tell the tale.
(Para 261)
The reports received from the Superintendent of Jail reflect that each of the
three accused, have a record of overall good conduct in prison and display
inclination to reform. It is evident that they have already, while in prison, taken
steps towards bettering their lives and of those around them, which coupled with
their young age unequivocally demonstrates that there is in fact, a probability of
reform. On consideration of all the circumstances overall, the option of life
imprisonment is certainly not foreclosed.
(Para 262)
While there is no doubt that this case captured the attention and indignation of
the society in Indore, and perhaps the State of Madhya Pradesh, as a cruel crime
that raised alarm regarding safety within the community - it must be remembered
that public opinion has categorically been held to be neither an objective
circumstance relating to crime, nor the criminal, and the courts must exercise
judicial restraint and play a balancing role.
(Para 263)
In view of the totality of facts and circumstances, and for the abovestated
reasons, the Supreme Court finds that imposition of death sentence would be
unwarranted in the present case. It would be appropriate and in the overall interests
of justice to commute the death sentence of all three accused, to life imprisonment
for a minimum term of 25 years.

Held :
If an accused is entitled to any legitimate benefit during trial the Public Prosecutor
should not scuttle/conceal it. On the contrary, it is the duty of the Public Prosecutor
to winch it to the fore and make it available to the accused.
(Para 199)
Therefore, a Public Prosecutor has wider set of duties than to merely ensure that
the accused is punished, the duties of ensuring fair play in the proceedings, all
relevant facts are brought before the court in order for the determination of truth
and justice for all the parties including the victims. It must be noted that these
duties do not allow the Prosecutor to be lax in any of his duties as against the
accused.
(Para 200)
Historically but consistently the view of the Supreme Court has been that an
investigation must be fair and effective, must proceed in proper direction in
consonance with the ingredients of the offence and not in haphazard manner. In
some cases besides investigation being effective the accused may have to prove
miscarriage of justice but once it is shown the accused would be entitled to definite
benefit in accordance with law. The investigation should be conducted in a manner
so as to draw a just balance between citizen's right under Articles 19 and 21 of the
Constitution and expansive power of the police to make investigation.
(Para 202)
A concept of fair investigation and fair trial are concomitant to preservation of
the fundamental right of the accused under Article 21 of the Constitution. The
accused is not subjected to harassment, his right to defence is not unduly
hampered and what he is entitled to receive in accordance with law is not denied to

him contrary to law.
(Para 202)
In the present case, the trial court ought to have inquired more deeply into the
role of DW 1, given that by her own deposition she had admitted to analysing call
detail records and involvement in N's arrest - all of which had been suppressed by
the prosecution side, for reasons best known to them.
(Para 205)
Section 91 CrPC empowers the court to summon production of any document
or thing which the court considers necessary or desirable for the purposes of any
investigation, inquiry, trial or another proceeding under the provisions of CrPC.
Where Section 91 read with Section 243 says that if the accused is called upon to
enter his defence and produce his evidence there he has also been given the right to
apply to the court for issuance of process for compelling the attendance of any
witness for the purpose of examination, cross-examination or the production of
any document or other thing for which the court has to pass a reasoned order.
(Para 205)
The provisions of Section 207 CrPC have a material bearing on this subject and
make an interesting reading. The provisions of Section 207 CrPC not only require or
mandate that the court without delay and free of cost should furnish to the accused
copies of the police report, first information report, statements, confessional
statements of the persons recorded under Section 161 whom the
prosecution wishes to examine as witnesses, of course, excluding any part of a
statement or document as contemplated under Section 173(6) CrPC, any other
document or relevant extract thereof which has been submitted to the Magistrate
by the police under sub-section (5) of Section 173. In contradistinction to the
provisions of Section 173, where the legislature has used the expression
"documents on which the prosecution relies" are not used under Section 207 CrPC.
Therefore, the provisions of Section 207 CrPC will have to be given liberal and
relevant meaning so as to achieve its object. Not only this, the documents
submitted to the Magistrate along with the report under Section 173(5) would
deem to include the documents which have to be sent to the Magistrate during the
course of investigation as per the requirement of Section 170(2) CrPC.
(Para 206)
To claim documents within the purview of scope of Sections 207, 243 read with
the provisions of Section 173 in its entirety and power of the court under Section
91 CrPC to summon documents signifies and provides precepts which will govern
the right of the accused to claim copies of the statement and documents which the
prosecution has collected during investigation and upon which they rely.
(Para 206)
It will be difficult for the Court to say that the accused has no right to claim
copies of the documents or request the court for production of a document which
is part of the general diary subject to satisfying the basic ingredients of law stated
therein. A document which has been obtained bona fide and has bearing on the
case of the prosecution and in the opinion of the Public Prosecutor, the same should
be disclosed to the accused in the interest of justice and fair investigation and trial
should be furnished to the accused. Then that document should be disclosed to the
accused giving him chance of fair defence, particularly when non-production or
disclosure of such a document would affect administration of criminal justice and
the defence of the accused prejudicially.
(Para 206)
The concept of disclosure and duties of the Prosecutor under the English system
cannot be made applicable to the Indian criminal jurisprudence stricto sensu at this
stage. However, the doctrine of disclosure would have to be given somewhat
expanded application.
(Para 206)
In this manner, the Public Prosecutor, and then the trial court's scrutiny, both
play an essential role in safeguarding the accused's right to fair investigation, when
faced with the might of the State's police machinery.
(Para 207)
Thus, it is held that the prosecution, in the interests of fairness, should as a
matter of rule, in all criminal trials, comply with the above rule, and furnish the list of
statements, documents, material objects and exhibits which are not relied upon by
the investigating officer. The presiding officers of courts in criminal trials shall ensure
compliance with such rules.

K. Criminal Procedure Code, 1973 - Ss. 172(2) and 173(3) - Diary of
proceedings in investigation - Powers of court to summon - Right of
accused, if any, to access the same - Principles clarified
Held :
The scheme of the CrPC under Chapter XII (Information to Police and Powers to
Investigate) is clear - the police have the power to investigate freely and fairly; in
the course of which, it is mandatory to maintain a diary where the day-to-day
proceedings are to be recorded with specific mention of time of events, places
visited, departure and reporting back, statements recorded, etc. While the criminal
court is empowered to summon these diaries under Section 172(2) for the purpose
of inquiry or trial (and not as evidence), Section 173(3) makes it clear that the
accused cannot claim any right to peruse them, unless the police themselves, rely
on it (to refresh their memory) or if the court uses it for contradicting the
testimony of the police officers.
(Para 203)
The purpose and the object seems to be quite clear that there should be fairness
in investigation, transparency and a record should be maintained to ensure a proper
investigation. This object is rendered entirely meaningless if the police fail to
maintain the police diary accurately. Failure to meticulously note down the steps
taken during investigation, and the resulting lack of transparency, undermines the
accused's right to fair investigation; it is up to the trial court that must take an
active role in scrutinising the record extensively, rather than accept the prosecution
side willingly, so as to bare such hidden or concealed actions taken during the
course of investigation.

Case of the prosecution must be judged as a whole having regard to the

Held :
Invariably the witnesses add embroidery to prosecution story, perhaps for the
fear of being disbelieved. But that is no ground to throw the case overboard, if true,
in the main. If there is a ring of truth in the main, the case should not be rejected. It
is the duty of the court to cull out the nuggets of truth from the evidence unless
there is reason to believe that the inconsistencies or falsehood are so glaring as
utterly to destroy confidence in the witnesses. It is necessary to remember that a
Judge does not preside over a criminal trial merely to see that no innocent man is
punished. A Judge also presides to see that a guilty man does not escape. One is as
important as the other. Both are public duties which the Judge has to perform.
(Para 177)
The defect in the investigation by itself cannot be a ground for acquittal. If
primacy is given to such designed or negligent investigations or to the omissions
or lapses by perfunctory investigation, the faith and confidence of the people in the
criminal justice administration would be eroded.
(Para 178)
The case of the prosecution must be judged as a whole having regard to the
totality of the evidence. In appreciating the evidence, the approach of the court
must be integrated not truncated or isolated. In other words, the impact of
evidence in totality on the prosecution case or innocence of the accused has to be
kept in mind in coming to the conclusion as to the guilt or otherwise of the accused.
In reaching a conclusion about the guilt of the accused, the court has to appreciate,
analyse and assess the evidence placed before it by the yardstick of probabilities, its
intrinsic value and the animus of witnesses.
(Para 179)
1370, affirmed
The concealment of DW 1's role in this case's investigation (her analysing of call
detail records of the deceased and in connection to accused N-which was not
produced in trial; tip-off allegedly received regarding N's whereabouts and what she
would be wearing; participating in N's arrest, and subsequent involvement on 23-6-
2011 in recoveries of articles) points to concerning gaps in the manner of
investigation carried out initially, or at the very least, an untruthful recollection and
presentation of it, for the purposes of trial. As elaborated earlier, these facts
prompted the Supreme Court to draw adverse inferences against the prosecution's
version of N's arrest. Other circumstances have been proved sufficiently to
conclude their guilt and result in conviction.

of
discrepancies/contradictions/omissions in depositions, reiterated -
Evidence Act, 1872, S. 3
Held :
If discrepancies in the depositions are minor, or that witnesses contradict
themselves during their testimonies (as opposed to their previous police
statements) what is important is the nature of contradictions. Courts should bear in
mind that it is only when discrepancies in the evidence of a witness are so
incompatible with the credibility of his version that the court is justified in jettisoning
his evidence. But too serious a view to be adopted on mere variations falling in the
narration of an incident (either as between the evidence of two witnesses or as
between two statements of the same witness) is an unrealistic approach for judicial
scrutiny.
(Para 180)
The court while appreciating the evidence must not attach undue importance to
minor discrepancies. The discrepancies which do not shake the basic version of the
prosecution case may be discarded.
(Para 181)
The omission of some of the prosecution witnesses to mention a particular fact,
or corroborate something, which is deposed to by other witnesses, therefore, does
not ipso facto favour an accused. What is important, however, is whether the
omission to depose about a fact is so fundamental that the prosecution version
becomes shaky and incredulous.

investigation took place on the evening of 19-6-2011, but he clarified that the
Forensic Department personnel who reached the site before him had secured the
place - Considering said consistent evidence, the possibility of members of the

- Words and Phrases - "Fingerprints", "elimination prints" - Evidence Act,
1872, S. 45
Held :
Fingerprints collected at a crime scene from all personnel who were at the scene
and who might have inadvertently touched physical evidence, are known as
"elimination prints". In the present case, elimination prints of the deceased were
obtained on second day of occurrence i.e. on 20-6-2021; they were part of the
record. The record would show that PW 3, PW 5, PW 9 were present at the crime
scene, but admittedly their fingerprints were not obtained. It appears from the
testimony of PW 9 that initially, the witnesses were asked to be outside, but later,
asked to join the proceedings, to witness the seizures made. All the three
witnesses, consistently deposed regarding fingerprint experts' visit to the site, the
use of powder on the surfaces and lifting of fingerprints. PW 5, in the cross-
examination
&
said that his fingerprint was not obtained. During the hearing, the counsel for the
appellants had repeatedly emphasised that elimination prints were not taken from
others present at the crime scene; they also highlighted that fingerprints were not
lifted from the knives, pistol and ornaments seized from the accused.
(Para 127)
In the opinion of the Supreme Court, nothing material turns on this aspect. What
is important is whether the crime scene was secured, and whether the lifting of
prints was witnessed. On both counts, the prosecution evidence is credible and
worthy of acceptance. These are also corroborated by the testimony of PW 21, the
Senior Scientific Officer, and the crime scene report dated 20-6-2021 (Ext. P-77)
tendered by him.

were corroborated by the three witnesses (PW 3, PW 5 and PW 9) apart from the
IO, the credibility of this circumstance i.e. the lifting of the prints from the crime
scene, their match with the sample prints of the accused, and the expert's
testimony stand proved. Hence, the appellant's arguments questioning the
credibility of this part, on the ground of delay in the report, is insubstantial and is

person and reported the matter to PS concerned - Furthermore, the signatures of

present case cannot have a clinching, or high degree of probative value - Criminal
Procedure Code, 1973, S. 45
Held :
The UK Court of Appeal has laid down the following guidelines concerning the
procedure for introducing DNA evidence in trials : (1) the scientist should adduce
the evidence of the DNA comparisons together with his calculations of the random
occurrence ratio; (2) whenever such evidence is to be adduced, the Crown
(prosecution) should serve upon the defence details as to how the calculations
have been carried out, which are sufficient for the defence to scrutinise the basis of
the calculations; (3) the Forensic Science Service should make available to a
defence expert, if requested, the databases upon which the calculations have been
based.
(Para 152)
DNA usually can be obtained from any biological material such as blood, semen,
saliva, hair, skin, bones, etc. The question as to whether DNA tests are virtually
infallible may be a moot question, but the fact remains that such test has come to
stay and is being used extensively in the investigation of crimes and the court often
accepts the views of the experts, especially when cases rest on circumstantial
evidence. More than half a century, samples of human DNA began to be used in the
criminal justice system. Of course, debate lingers over the safeguards that should
be required in testing samples and in presenting the evidence in court. DNA profile,
however, is consistently held to be valid and reliable, but of course, it depends on
the quality control and quality assurance procedures in the laboratory.
(Para 154)
Like all other opinion evidence, the probative value accorded to DNA evidence
also varies from case to case, depending on the facts and circumstances and the
weight accorded to other evidence on record, whether contrary or corroborative.
This is all the more important to remember, given that even though the accuracy of
DNA evidence may be increasing with the advancement of science and technology
with every passing day, thereby making it more and more reliable, the Supreme
Court has not yet reached a juncture where it may be said to be infallible. Thus, it
cannot be said that the absence of DNA evidence would lead to an adverse
inference against a party, especially in the presence of other cogent and reliable
evidence on record in favour of such party.
(Para 157)
In the present case, what is apparent, is that PW 35 Dr P, Scientific Officer, DNA
Fingerprint Unit FSL has virtually echoed the DNA analysis in his chief examination,
and not chosen to elaborate on the random occurrence ratio i.e. the probability of
the accused's samples matching with those allegedly found at the crime scene. The
Supreme Court has already discussed whether the recoveries of 23-6-2011
pursuant to disclosures made that day can be accepted and held that they are
suspect and need to be discarded. This leaves the report, to the extent it says that
samples lifted from recoveries made at the crime scene matched with what was
seized on 22-6-2011 (knives, and other articles), to be inconclusive.
(Para 159)
It is noteworthy that seizure Memo Ext. 27, in terms of which Article A-9 (ID
3063) is said to have been seized, does not record that as a matter of fact,
a
bedsheet was seized. If one keeps in mind that source H2 (ID 3078) in relation to
Neha was seized on 23-4-2011, and from an open area, the likelihood of its
contamination-ever if arguendo the genuineness of its recovery might have been
accepted-carried some degree of probability. For these reasons, it is held that the
DNA report in the present case cannot have a clinching, or high degree of probative
value.

Held :
Five golden principles, need to be kept in mind while deciding case based on
circumstantial evidence, are extracted below:
(1) The circumstances from which the conclusion of guilt is to be drawn
should be fully established. There is not only a grammatical but a legal distinction
between "may be proved" and "must be or should be proved". Certainly, it is
a
primary principle that the accused must be and not merely may be guilty before
a court can convict and the mental distance between "may be" and "must be" is
long and divides vague conjectures from sure conclusions.
(2) The facts so established should be consistent only with the hypothesis of
the guilt of the accused, that is to say, they should not be explainable on any
other hypothesis except that the accused is guilty,
(3) The circumstances should be of a conclusive nature and tendency.
(4) They should exclude every possible hypothesis except the one to be
proved, and
(5) There must be a chain of evidence so complete as not to leave any
reasonable ground for the conclusion consistent with the innocence of the
accused and must show that in all human probability the act must have been
done by the accused.
These five golden principles constitute the panchsheel of the proof of a case based
on circumstantial evidence.
(para 167)
654, cited
In this case, as against N, the circumstances proved are:
(1) Firstly, recovery of articles including two golden bangles, a broken
mangalsutra, 3 guriyas, a gold pendant, an ATM card which belonged to
deceased M on 22-6-2011. The loss of these articles was reported by PW 1, on
21-6-2011 i.e. one day before N's arrest.
(2) The second circumstance proved by the prosecution is the TIP of these
articles by PW 1 who was able to correctly identify them (as also corroborated
by PW 12 during the trial). Linked with this circumstance is the deposition of PW
27, a Bank of India, Ujjain official who deposed to issuing a letter to the SHO,
(Ext. P-98), containing the ATM card numbers. The ATM card
(5264959108034023) which belonged to M, recovered on 22-6-2011 pursuant
to N's disclosure statement, from her house, was issued by that bank.
(3) The third circumstance proved by the prosecution against Neha is her
fingerprint. PW 24, the fingerprint expert, deposed to searching the crime scene
for possibility of lifting impressions of fingerprints. A set of five fingerprints (i.e.
Ext. P-80 chance fingerprints) were lifted by him which was witnessed by two
witnesses (PW 5 and PW 9) who corroborated the fact. The Supreme Court has
held, previously that the possibility of others' presence at the crime scene, and
its contamination could be ruled out, because of the deposition of these two
witnesses, as well as other depositions. PW 17 obtained the fingerprint samples
of N (Ext. P-43), which he deposed to during the trial. The deficiencies alleged by
the appellants, in the opinion of the Supreme Court, about the procedural lapses
in the collection of such evidence, are not convincing. The evidence of PW 24, as
well as his report (Ext. P-84) prove that a chance fingerprint (Sample E,
collected from the crime scene) matched with the sample obtained from her, by
PW 17 during the investigation.
(4) The fourth circumstance, against N, which was established during the
trial-and a vital one, is her knowledge of the crime. Her disclosure statement
led to arrests of Rahul and Manoj, and recovery of stolen and other articles from
their possession.
(para 188)
As against R, the circumstances proved are:
(1) Firstly, the circumstances relating to his arrest (witnessed by PW 3 and
PW 6), on 22-6-2011 were proved by the prosecution.
(2) The second circumstance proved is that his disclosure statement led to
recovery and seizure of stolen articles and other articles connected with the
crime (Ext. P-14), including two bent golden bangles, part of broken
mangalsutra, a country-made pistol, a knife measuring 35.5 cm, and a
photograph showing R wearing black diamond-like beaded bracelet.
(3) The third circumstance is that, like with N, PW 1 identified the gold
jewellery recovered from R's possession, during the TIP (further corroborated by
PW 12).
(4) The fourth circumstance proved is that PW 24 the fingerprint expert,
deposed that he found that Prints A and B lifted from the crime scene (as
corroborated by PW 5 and PW 9) matched with the index and middle fingerprints
respectively of R's right hand, in the sample (Ext. P-41) collected from him by
PW 17.
(5) The fifth circumstance proved during the trial is that R had reported late in
the evening of 19-6-2011, that he was shot on the right foot, by unknown
persons. This was recorded in the form of a dehati nalisi against unknown
persons; later an FIR (Ext. P-107) was registered by PW 30 for the offences
punishable under Sections 294, 307 and 34 IPC. R was initially taken to District
Hospital (proved by the treatment card Ext. P-97 dated 19-6-2011). R was
however, referred to M.Y. Hospital, and examined by PW 32, who operated
upon him. Ext. P-113 is the discharge card of M.Y. Hospital signed by PW 32
(who also deposed about it) on 20-6-2011. PW 29 who recorded the initial
report dehati nalisi, also identified R as the boy who had reported the incident.
The bullet extracted from his foot was deposited (under memo Ext. P-113) in
the Medico-Legal Cell of the hospital, and later seized (under memo Ext. P-108)
on 23-6-2011. The FIR relating to this case was later closed. The other fact
proved is the seizure of a right shoe (Ext. P-75) under jurisdiction of
Annapurna PS (proved by PW 20), which the trial court observed had a bullet hole
at the top.
(6) The sixth circumstance proved against R, which is material, is the ballistic
report which stated that the two bullets (found at the crime scene) were
compatible to the certified bullet of 7.65 mm calibre cartridge; bullet TB-A1 was
found similar. Three pieces of skin were found copper positive. Importantly,
according to the report, two bullets, EB2 and EB1 (recovered from the body of
M, the deceased, and R's right foot respectively) were fired from pistol Ext. A-1,
seized from Rahul's house. The report also stated that the gunshot fired at the
seized right shoe (mentioned above) was caused by a copper-jacketed bullet. All
this was proved by the ballistics report (Ext. P-120) that had analysed each of
these items. The report also revealed that the ballistics expert (PW 16) had test
fired from the pistol sent to FSL, and had found that the pistol had signs that the
two spent cartridges, were fired from it.
(para 189)
As against M, the circumstances proved are:
(1) The first circumstance proved against him, is his arrest and subsequent
disclosure statement, at 10.05 a.m. on 22-6-2011 (proved by PW 3 and PW 6).
(2) The second circumstance is the recovery and seizure of articles, at M's
behest, and from his possession, including - two golden bangles, portion of a
broken mangalsutra, a knife and a photograph with M in sunglasses (Ext. -17,
also proved by same witnesses).
(3) The third circumstance proved against M is that PW 1 identified the
golden jewellery recovered from his possession, during the TIP (corroborated by
PW 12).
(para 190)
Thus, it is held that all the circumstances and the link connecting them, was
sufficiently established by the prosecution and proved beyond reasonable doubt.
Similarly, every hypothesis suggesting the innocence of the appellants is ruled out
by such evidence, and the irresistible inference which follows, is their guilt.
(Para 191)
Thus, the proof of the circumstances against the appellants clearly points to their
guilt, and involvement in the crime.
(Para 192)
Information as to how these attacks occurred within the house of the deceased
and the distinct roles played by the accused, are in the special knowledge of only
the accused; but no such information was forthcoming through the course of the
trial or appellate stage.
(Para 194)
For the above reasons, all three accused are held guilty of the offences under
Sections 397/34, 449/34 and 302/34 IPC. Additionally, M and R's conviction under
Section 25(1-B)(b) of the Arms Act, and R's conviction under Section 27 of the
Arms Act, is upheld.

28, while on patrolling duty, claimed to have seen accused N, loitering suspiciously
at 6.00 a.m. on 23-6-2011, near an ATM - IO formed a team, went to the site
and recovered an ATM card belonging to deceased from N and, thereafter, N was
taken in for questioning and later arrested and police recovered other robbed
articles at her behest and also arrested other two accused - However, DW 1, an
ASI admitted to analysing call detail records and importantly, to receiving
information from an undisclosed "source" that N would be at the spot from where
she was ultimately arrested on 22-6-2011 - DW 1 deposed that she had received
this tip off prior to N's arrest i.e. before 6.30 a.m., and she shared this information
with the police - PW 28, however, denied the involvement of DW 1 in the
investigation - During her deposition, DW 1 affirmed that she went to the crime
scene on 19-6-2011 itself and, further, the documentary evidence produced by
IGP, examined as defence witness, also established that DW 1 received an out-of-
turn promotion for her role in solving the crime - Hence, DW 1, held, had received
prior information regarding N's likely whereabouts and further details even to the
extent of a description of her attire - Further, as deposed by the father of N, she
was taken away for questioning much earlier, on 19-6-2011 itself - Further, PW 7
who concededly joined the investigation as a panch witness on 23-6-2011,
admitted that DW 1 participated in the recovery of articles on 23-6-2011, a day
after the arrest of all the accused - Resultantly, considering DW 1's role in the pre-
arrest, intelligence information gathering, the arrest, interrogation of N, which the
prosecution tried to studiously keep away from the court, prosecution version with
respect to apprehension and arrest of N, held, not believable - However, in the
facts and circumstances of the case, there was sufficient other circumstantial
evidence to support conviction of N - Criminal Procedure Code, 1973, S. 41

Prosecution claimed to have spotted one of the accused, namely, N at around 6.00
a.m. on 22-6-2011/23-6-2011 outside an ATM and a lady constable recovered an
ATM card from N belonging to one of the deceased and from her house police also
recovered some other robbed articles - Upon disclosure statements of N, police
arrested the remaining two accused and recovered from their possession the
robbed jewellery, knife and a pistol - Doubt regarding manner of arrest of N, held,
cannot be made a ground to reject the entire story i.e. disclosure statements and
the recoveries effected on 22-6-2011/23-6-2011 - Criminal Procedure Code,
1973, S. 41
Held :
The rejection of the prosecution version with respect to N's arrest would mean
that only that circumstance is held not to be proved. It is not that N's arrest
provided sole foundation of the prosecution case. In some ways, it is an entry
point; its rejection would mean that the Court should proceed cautiously with other
evidence, objectively determine whether all other circumstances were proved
beyond reasonable doubt, and whether in the end the guilt of the accused and not
others, has been so proved.

PW 3 and PW 6 - Though, PW 3 found relating to the deceased, but PW 6 found
having no relation with deceased and he merely knew PW 3 and had known one of
the deceased for about 10-15 yrs - Both witnesses corroborated each other's
testimony and proved the prosecution story about N's questioning, her arrest,
disclosure statement, recoveries made pursuant to her statement, as well as the

2011 around 5.00-5.15 p.m. - Witness claimed to have informed the police on 20
-6-2011 that in the evening of 19-6-2011, he saw two boys trying to start a
motorcycle one of them was bleeding from the ankle, and the other, at the forearm
and, thereafter, a girl arrived on a Scooty and advised them that it would be better
to go to the hospital - He not only admitted to having previously deposed as a
witness on behalf of the police in some other case, but he also could not
convincingly explain his presence near the scene of crime, or rather after it -
Furthermore, his statement suffered from improvement and contradictions -
Hence, held, he was a stock witness and, thus, held not believable - Evidence Act,
1872, S. 3
Held :
A chance witness is one, who appears on the scene suddenly. Such witnesses
have the habit of appearing suddenly on the scene when something is happening
and then of disappearing after noticing the occurrence about which they are called
later on to give evidence.
(Para 102)
The evidence of a chance witness requires a very cautious and close scrutiny
and a chance witness must adequately explain his presence at the place of
occurrence. Deposition of a chance witness whose presence at the place of incident
remains doubtful should be discarded.
(Para 104)
The deposition of this witness (PW 10) cannot be taken at face value. PW 10
improved upon his statement made to the police and was confronted in this regard.
His initial statement to the police did not mention the presence of the girl (whom he
identified as N in court). Likewise, he improves upon his statement, by deposing in
court that the girl had asked two boys to take one injured seriously to the hospital.
In addition, his contradictions as to what led him to the police station on 20-0-2011
- obtaining a gumasta licence, or to report the crime; and his presence at the
The surest way t legal research!
scene of the crime - as a property broker checking vacancy of a property, who
admittedly had no licence for this business, are material. These contradictions are
serious inasmuch as they strike at the root of the witness's credibility. His
prevarications and improvements especially about the presence of a girl are too
serious and fundamental to overlook. Very crucially this witness appears to be a
stock witness. For all the aforesaid reasons the depositions of PW 10 cannot be
accepted.

(1964) 3 SCR 397 : AIR 1965 SC 328; Shankarlal V. State of Rajasthan, (2004)
ZC. Penal Code, 1860 - Ss. 302, 397 and 449 r/w S. 34 - Identification
of accused - When not believable
- Prosecution claimed that accused M was injured during the incident and
secured treatment from PW 8 - Identification of M by PW 8 in the court, held not
believable, when probability of M practising his medical profession was found to be
under the shadow of police patronage and he was not involved by the police during
the test identification parade - Evidence Act, 1872, S. 9
Held :
In this case, the prosecution relied on the testimony of PW 8 to say that M had
obtained treatment from him. The witness, during his deposition stated that he had
studied from a Science College in Pakistan. He admitted to not being licensed to
practise medicine, by the Medical Council of India; he also admitted that he did not
hold any permission to practise as a doctor, but ran Kavita clinic. He identified M in
court, and said that on 19-6-2011, M had secured treatment for an injury on his
elbow, and another boy (who spoke in Sindhi) accompanied him. He proved Ext. P-
37, the slip issued by him, containing the prescription for M, which was seized on 25
-6-2011 (Ext. P-36) by the IO (PW 31), who deposed to it.
(Para 106)
PW 8 is not a reliable witness. Apart from the fact that he is admittedly an
unqualified professional, and an unlicensed one - at best a quack, the appellants
quite correctly point out that his previous links with the police cannot be ruled out,
for the reason that he migrated, later than during Partition, from Pakistan. The
probability of him practising his profession under the shadow of police patronage,
for some kind of quid pro quo i.e. being a convenient witness, leaves a lurking
suspicion. The police did not involve him during the test identification parade;
admittedly, M was in fact taken to him during the investigation. In these
circumstances, the testimony of this witness is not credible. This circumstance is
therefore, held not to be proved.

saw the accused, fleetingly - Further, no attempt was made by the
prosecution to draw a sketch or to show the approximate distance from
where this witness observed the accused - Resultantly, unexplained delay
in holding TIP, held, fatal - Evidence Act, 1872, S. 9
Held :
TIP procedures are used, where witnesses who claim to have seen the accused
at, or about the time of occurrence to identify such accused from the midst of
other individuals, who bear physical attributes similar to them, without any aid
or other source. TIPs are meant to test witness veracity and their capability to
identify unknown persons. TIPs should normally be conducted at the earliest
possible time to eliminate the chance of accused being shown to witnesses before
the identification parade, which might otherwise affect such witnesses' memory.
TIPs are conducted during investigation; however, there is no provision of law
enabling an accused to claim it as a matter of right. There is no hard-and-fast rule
that delay or failure in holding the TIP ipso facto renders the evidence inadmissible
or unacceptable; it however, affects the credibility and weight attached to such
identification.
(Para 110)
PW 10 omitted to mention basic details about the distance from between where
he was, and where he saw the accused. Further, his account suggests that he
apparently saw the accused, fleetingly. No attempt was made by the prosecution to
draw a sketch or to show the approximate distance from where this witness (who
is vital to its case) observed the accused. Given these facts, and the delay
(unexplained by the prosecution, which had by its account, wrapped up the case by
the end of June 2011) to conduct the TIP after the accused's arrest, renders the
TIP suspect. It cannot be said that the TIPs conducted and the subsequent dock
identification, by PW 10 of the accused, are among the circumstances proved
beyond reasonable doubt.

- Incident resulting in three deaths occurred in the house of the victims on 19-6

PW 1 in the TIP conducted on 9-7-2011 under the supervision of PW 12 - Both
these witnesses deposed among similar lines, but PW 1 stated about the presence
of PW 7, though PW 7 himself denied his presence - Apart from urging this to be
an inconsistency, defence also cast suspicion on the TIP of the jewellery, urging that
neither AS nor the Police Constable who took the sealed items to the venue of the
TIP was examined - These omissions, held, are minor, and do not shake the
essential credibility of the proper identification of the jewellery, particularly when
during cross-examination, PW 12 clearly deposed that besides him no one was
present during the TIP of the articles and that after PW 1 completed the
identification, he drew the memo and kept the jewellery separately and the rest
were taken away by AS - Evidence Act, 1872, S. 9
(Para 115)
ZF. Penal Code, 1860 - Ss. 397 and 449 r/w S. 34 - Identity of looted
articles - Challenge as to identification of jewellery items at TIP - When
not tenable
- Incident of looting certain articles including jewellery and killing wife, daughter
and mother-in-law of PW 1 occurred in the rented house of the victims on 19-6-
2011 - On 21-6-2011, PW 1 reported that 2 ATM cards, mobile, camera and
specific jewellery items were missing from the premises - Said challenge made by
contending that the articles were common pieces of jewellery, without any
distinctive features and that PW 1 could hardly know these, particularly, jewellery of
his mother-in-law
- Held, if one keeps in mind that PW 1 had reported the loss of the articles, and
listed them specifically, in his statement which was given to the police on 21-6-
2011, their subsequent recovery, at the behest and pointing out of the accused,
and their correct identification by PW 1 before PW 12, there cannot be doubts of its
credibility, particularly when during his cross-examination, PW 1 was not questioned
about how he could identify jewellery articles of his wife, daughter and mother-in-
law - Evidence Act, 1872, S. 9
Held :
There can be various reasons, why someone may be able to recollect or
remember jewellery or other valuables. There cannot be any general assumption
that a husband would not be able to remember or recollect the personal articles of
his wife, or that a wife cannot be expected to recollect and identify the personal
effects of her husband. It all depends on the personality and individual traits of
human being, which uniquely differ from each other. It is possible that PW 1 had an
eye for detail; it is equally possible that he was present when the valuables were
bought; or yet, it is further possible that they were part of a set, presented to the
deceased individuals. The recollection, reporting and identification of the
mangalsutra, is more specific. PW 1 could reasonably be assumed to be aware of
that article, belonging to M, his wife. In these circumstances, the evidence relating
to the recovery of items belonging to the deceased, recovered from the accused's
premises at their behest, and their correct identification by PW 1 during TIP were
proved beyond reasonable doubt, by the prosecution.

ZG. Penal Code, 1860 - Ss. 302, 397 and 449 r/w S. 34 - Appreciation
of evidence - Omission to depose about certain facts, by witnesses - Held,
cannot inure to the accused's benefit, when each of the facts they omitted
found supported by one or more of the Other witnesses - Evidence Act,
1872, S. 3
(Para 183)
ZH. Penal Code, 1860 - Ss. 302, 397 and 449 r/w S. 34 - Omission to
examine witnesses - Held, not material, when the witnesses not examined
by the prosecution did not undermine the prosecution and the foundation of
the fact or facts sought to be proved, remained unshaken as per witnesses
examined before the Court - Evidence Act, 1872, S. 134
Held :
The failure to examine certain persons, like AS, PI, AT, or Nk, cannot inure to the
accused's benefit. AS was present during the TIP of seized articles, when other
similar articles brought by him, for comparison and identification by PW 1.
The latter witness was able to identify the articles which had been seized from the
accused; this was deposed to by PW 12, whose testimony cannot be doubted. The
failure to examine AS therefore, was a lapse, but not a fatal one, as far as the TIP
itself went. Likewise, the failure to examine PI is of no consequence, because the
recoveries made on 23-6-2011 have not been accepted. The omission to examine
NK is also inconsequential, given the sequence of reporting of the crime, and the
rapidity of the events which developed after it. No doubt, AT noticed the right shoe
with a bullet hole, first; however, PW 20 was also with him; he deposed to the fact
of its discovery and seizure. Similarly, the failure to examine Constable D is also not
fatal, given the testimony of PW 29 and PW 30.
(Para 184)
Even where a case hangs on the evidence of one eyewitness, it may be enough
to sustain the conviction given sterling testimony of a competent, honest man
although as a rule of prudence courts call for corroboration. It is a platitude to say
that witnesses have to be weighed and not counted since quality matters more
than quantity in human affairs.
(Para 185)
Conviction can be recorded on the basis of the statement of a single eyewitness
provided his credibility is not shaken by any adverse circumstance appearing on the
record against him and the court, at the same time, is convinced that he is a
truthful witness.
(Para 186)
Therefore, unless it is shown that the omission to examine a witness, who had
previously participated during the investigation and whose statement was recorded
by the police, undermines the prosecution case, or impacts on it significantly, the
foundation of the fact or facts which are sought to be proved, remains unshaken as
long as that fact is deposed to or spoken about by other witnesses, whose
testimonies are to be seen in their own terms. Therefore, the omission to examine
the individuals left out, but who the prosecution claimed, had participated during the
investigation, did not affect its case, as far as the circumstances held to have been
established by it, are concerned.

Thevar V. State of Madras, AIR 1957 SC 614, affirmed
ZI. Penal Code, 1860 - Ss. 302, 397 and 449 r/w S. 34 - Robbery with
murder - Sharing common intention, when one of the appellants carrying
no weapon, while the others were - Whether established
- Held, the common intention requires prior meeting of mind, which can also be
developed on the spur of the moment, provided there is premeditated concert -
Evidence clearly established common intention among the three accused, to rob the
house, and upon facing resistance to complete the job and leave undetected, by all
means necessary - Though, no weapon was recovered from N, but her
involvement in the offences and presence at the scene of the crime was clearly
proved on the record - Hence, lack of an overt or specific act of violence
attributable to N would not exonerate her and, therefore, conviction of all the
appellants with aid of S. 34, held, justified - Arms Act, 1959, Ss. 25(1-B)(b) and
27
Held :
While no weapon has been recovered from N, it is clear that she was involved in
the offences, and was present at the scene of the crime. This is evidenced by
firstly, the fingerprint expert's testimony and report, which clearly reflects that her
fingerprint was lifted from the crime scene; secondly, the recovery of stolen articles
(gold jewellery, M's ATM card, etc.) from her possession; and thirdly, the fact that
M and R are only arrested pursuant to her disclosure of their participation - all of
which, cumulatively, clearly establish her involvement. The lack of an overt or
specific act of violence attributable to N does not exonerate her, given that the
prosecution has been able to prove her presence at the crime scene and
participation in the commission of the offences, and that there was common
object.
(Para 195)
For the above reasons, all three accused are held guilty of the offences under
Sections 397/34, 449/34 and 302/34 IPC. Additionally, M and R's conviction under
Section 25(1-B)(b) of the Arms Act, and R's conviction under Section 27 of the
Arms Act, is upheld.

The Judgment of the Court was delivered by
S. RAVINDRA BHAT, J.- - The present judgment will dispose of three
appeals1 preferred by three accused persons. They were convicted
under Section 302 of the Penal Code, 1860 ("IPC") (3 counts) imposed
with death penalty by the judgment and orders of the First Additional
Sessions Judge, Indore². This was confirmed by a Division Bench of the
High Court of Madhya Pradesh at Indore³.
2. The appellants (Manoj, Rahul alias Govind and Neha Verma,
hereafter referred by their names) were convicted for the offence
punishable under Section 302 IPC (three counts) for committing the
murder, during the course of robbery, of Megha Deshpande, Ashlesha
Deshpande and Smt Rohini Phadke on 19-6-2011. All three appellants
were sentenced to capital punishment with fine of Rs 1000 on each
count, and in default of payment of fine, to undergo 6 months'
additional rigorous imprisonment ("RI") on each count. Under Section
397 IPC, they were sentenced to undergo 10 years' RI with fine of Rs
1000 and in default of payment of fine, 6 months' additional RI. Under
Section 449 IPC, they were sentenced to undergo 10 years' RI with fine
of Rs 1000, and in default of payment of fine, 6 months' additional RI.
Manoj and Rahul alias Govind were also convicted for the offence
punishable under Section 25(1-B)(b) of the Arms Act and sentenced to
undergo 1 year's RI with fine of Rs 1000 and in default of payment of
fine, 6 months' additional RI. Rahul was also convicted under Section
27 of the Arms Act and sentenced to undergo 3 years' RI with fine of Rs
3000 and in default of payment of fine, 6 months' additional RI.
Facts
3. The facts are that PW 1 Niranjan Deshpande rented a part of
House No. 24 Shrinagar Main from its landlord PW 5 Vishal Pandey, few
days before the date of incident i.e. 19-6-2011. Niranjan's wife Megha,
daughter Ashlesha and mother-in-law Smt Rohini Phadke were at those
premises, residing there. In the evening of that day another tenant PW
2 Dipti Kapil who lived on the same floor told PW 5 Vishal Pandey that
Niranjan's flat was bolted from the outside and reported seeing patches
of blood on the door. On receiving this information, the landlord went to
enquire. When no one opened the door, he looked through the open
window and saw the dead bodies of the deceased persons lying near
the bedroom door and blood was on the floor. He called his neighbour
PW 9 Mahesh Parmar and Mukesh on the spot, before telephoning PW 1
Niranjan Deshpande to reach there immediately. PW 5 Vishal Pandey
also lodged a first information report ("FIR") at Police Station MIG
Colony, Indore4 which was recorded by PW 31 Inspector Mohan Singh
Yadav, investigating officer ("IO"). The FIR alleging that some unknown
persons murdered the three deceased
ladies with sharp weapons and fled the scene, registered offences
punishable under Sections 302 IPC and 25 of the Arms Act.
4. The police reached the premises and prepared a spot map of the
crime scene. Several articles found at the spot were seized. It was later
(on the next day) reported that Megha's golden bangles and
mangalsutra, Rohini Phadke's two gold bangles, and Ashlesha's mobile
phone, camera and ATM cards were missing. Investigation started and
on 22-6-2011 at around 6.00 a.m., PW 28 Vijay Chauhan while on
patrolling duty, spotted Neha Verma outside an ATM near LIG, under
suspicious circumstances. On receiving this information, the IO (PW 31)
along with PW 4 Banno Solanki and others, reached the spot. Neha
Verma was searched. This yielded an ATM card, which belonged to the
deceased Ashlesha. Neha was taken for questioning; her disclosure
statements led to her subsequent arrest. Based on information she
provided, the police recovered some robbed articles from her house.
5. Upon disclosure statements of Neha the other accused i.e. Rahul
alias Govind and Manoj were arrested and from their possession the
robbed jewellery, knife and a pistol was seized. Investigation revealed
that during the alleged incident Rahul alias Govind inadvertently shot
his own foot and recorded a false FIR in this regard at Annapurna Police
Station by dehati nalisi dated 19-6-2011 5 against unknown persons.
Accordingly, an FIR was registered by PW 30 ASI R.S. Makwana for the
offences punishable under Sections 294, 307 and 34 IPC. Manoj was
also injured during the incident and secured treatment from PW 8 Dr
Achutmal Tejwani. The clothes and shoes worn by the accused were
seized; and parts of the broken and disposed mobile phone and camera
were also recovered and seized pursuant to their disclosure statements.
The appellants underwent identification parade. Their fingerprints were
examined, the seized articles were sent for chemical and DNA test and
permission for prosecution was taken.
6. After conclusion of investigation, the police filed a final report
indicting the appellants for commission of offence under Sections 302,
397 and 449 IPC and Sections 25, 27 of the Arms Act. The trial court
framed charges against the accused under Sections 397/34 in
alternative Sections 302/34 and 449 IPC, and besides these charges
Manoj was charged under Section 25(1-B)(b) of the Arms Act, 1959
and Rahul alias Govind was charged under Sections 25(1-B)(b) and 27
of the Arms Act. All the appellants abjured their guilt and claimed trial.
7. The prosecution examined 36 witnesses and produced certain
documents (Exts. P-1 to P-129) in support of their case. After recording
the evidence of prosecution, the appellants' statements were recorded
under Section 313 of the Criminal Procedure Code ("CrPC"). The
appellants examined a total of 6 defence witnesses and produced
certain documents (Exts. D-1 to D-50) in support of their case.
The trial court's findings
8. As the entire case was based on circumstantial evidence, upon
appreciation of the material evidence adduced by the prosecution, the
trial court concluded that the accused persons were present at the
scene of occurrence on 19-6-2011 at about 5.00-5.15 p.m. and that
evidence of experts who lifted the fingerprints of the accused (from the
house) along with the testimonies of PW 1, PW 2, PW 5, PW 9 and PW
31 proved that they had entered into the house. Upon recovery of the
knife and firearm which caused the death, it was established by way of
chemical, DNA as well as ballistic examination that those articles were
used and that during the sequence of the incident, blood of the
deceased persons was found on the clothes of the accused persons. The
trial court further concluded that the footprints at the crime scene were
similar to those of the shoes recovered from the accused persons, and
the gunshot injury caused by the bullet which hit the foot of Rahul alias
Govind as well as the bullet which hit the body of the deceased, were
fired from the same weapon, which was recovered from his possession.
It was held that this left no doubt in establishing the guilt of Rahul and
Manoj, and during the whole incident. The evidence also proved Neha's
presence at that time. The trial court held that this established her
involvement in the crime along with the accused persons; every
hypothesis of the innocence of the accused was ruled out.
9. After considering the evidence on record, the trial court convicted
the appellants of committing the offences they were charged with. On
the point of sentence, the trial court took the view that given the
magnitude and diabolic manner in which the offences were committed,
the case on hand fell under the category of the rarest of the rare case
and warranted death penalty.
High Court's findings confirming the trial court's order
10. The Division Bench of the High Court³ confirmed the sentences
imposed on the appellants and the reference made by the trial court
was answered in the affirmative. The High Court concluded that the
forensic experts as well as the neighbours and the investigating officer
had seen the bloodstained floor, walls, and bedsheets, and that the
evidence produced on record with respect to them did not leave any
major lacuna in the case of the prosecution; further, the presence of
the accused in the house, their intention of committing such a heinous
crime, and the manner in which the accused persons had caused the
death, had been duly proved.
11. The High Court relied upon the statements of fingerprint expert,
PW 24 K.K. Dwivedi who visited the site and lifted the chance
fingerprints which matched with the appellants' fingerprints, as well as
jewellery recovered from their possession which was identified by PW 1
and PW 3 as belonging to the deceased. The weapons (knife and
country-made pistol) used for the commission of the offence were
recovered from the accused and the same was proved. Also, the
accused persons were duly identified in open court by the witnesses
pursuant to their depositions.
12. The High Court further held that the accused, during their
examination under Section 313 CrPC failed to explain their conduct and
even gave incorrect and false answers. It therefore affirmed the trial
court's conclusions and findings.
13. Upon examination of whether this case would fall in the category
of "the rarest of the rare cases" to justify the imposition of capital
punishment on the appellants, the High Court was of the view that as
the incident shook the collective conscience of the community and the
acts of murder committed by the appellants were so gruesome,
merciless and brutal, the aggravating circumstances far outweighed the
mitigating circumstances and hence, this case fell under the category of
the rarest of the rare case which manifests society's abhorrence of such
crime.
Contentions on behalf of the appellants
14. Ms Anjana Prakash, learned Senior Counsel appearing pro bono
for Rahul and Manoj, contended that the evidence of witnesses i.e.
police witnesses and private witnesses in this case raise questions as to
whether Neha was arrested at the time and at the spot claimed by the
prosecution, whether her disclosure statements were genuine, whether
the disclosures were made as claimed, and whether subsequent arrests
and recoveries were in the manner claimed by the prosecution.
15. It was urged that PW 4 lady constable Banno Solanki deposed to
having gone to the ATM machine, searched Neha, leading to recovery of
Ashlesha's ATM card. However, she contradicted the IO and other
witnesses about the place of her interrogation. PW 4 deposed that Neha
was interrogated at the police station where she said that some
ornaments and ATM cards were in her house. This was confirmed by PW
6 Triyambak alias Prafulla and PW 36 Mulayam Singh Yadav. However,
the prosecution did not explain why no arrest memo/information memo
was prepared at the police station. It is argued that this is pertinent as
there is a serious dispute about the arrests and recoveries itself, as also
the manner claimed by the prosecution. Also, PW 4 the female
constable escorting the female accused, did not corroborate the
prosecution that any recoveries were made from Neha's house after her
interrogation. She was silent about whether she was part of the police
team which went to the house of Neha in her examination-in-chief. In
cross-examination she deposed to sitting in the same vehicle as Neha
while going to her house. The presence of PW 4 is only confirmed by
witnesses of the search team (i.e. PW 3 Dr Deepak Hari Ranadey and
PW 31 IO Mohan Singh). PW 4 further did not support the prosecution
that Neha had disclosed the names of Rahul and Manoj or having
accompanied Neha (which would be expected, the accused being a
woman) to the house of the two accused and the resulting subsequent
recoveries. She deposed that the police party returned to the police
station from Neha's house in the private vehicle. This suggests that the
arrest memo (Ext. P-9) and information memo (Ext. P-10) made at that
time and place is false and as a result, the subsequent story of Neha
leading the police party to the houses of Rahul and Manoj are also false.
16. It was further stated that PW 31 deposed that PW 28 Vijay
Chauhan, informed PW 19 Y.R. Gaikwad, about spotting a girl standing
suspiciously near an ATM for which PW 19 made a station diary entry
and informed him via wireless. PW 31 therefore went to the police
station, constituting a team - comprising himself, PW 4, PW 19, PW 28
and PW 36 - which left for the ATM spot and thereafter to Neha's
house (and those of Rahul and Manoj). It is submitted that neither was
the station diary produced, nor did PW 19 corroborate the deposition of
PW 31 at all. Likewise, there was variance between the statements of
PW 28 and PW 31, on whether he was in the raiding party that went to
Neha's house.
17. The counsel further argued that PW 31 deposed about various
persons accompanying him, when he learnt about Neha loitering
suspiciously. However, he omitted to mention PW 19, who received
information and told him about Neha's movement, at PW 28's behest.
This suggests that Neha was in fact, interrogated at the police station.
So, there was no reason for not preparing an arrest memo or recording
disclosure statement at that point in time, in the police station itself,
even though the ATM card had been recovered. PW 31 did not offer any
explanation as to why the disclosure was made on the way in the police
vehicle. The counsel also referred to PW 4's deposition, which was silent
on this aspect. Furthermore, the counsel highlighted that though family
members, particularly Neha's father were available, they were not
intimated about her arrest, nor were their signatures taken on the
arrest memo. It was urged that all these in fact corroborate the defence
submission that Neha's arrest did not take place as contended by the
prosecution.
18. Moving on to the arrest of Rahul and Manoj, some discrepancies
in the form of injuries found on their person and the manner their
occurrence was recorded before their disclosure statements (Exts. P-12
and P-13 in the case of Rahul and Exts. P-15 and P-16 in the case of
Manoj), were pointed out. How these injuries occurred in fact was
recorded before the disclosure statement. It was submitted that after
Neha's arrest, recoveries were made from Rahul's house (Ext. P-14) at
9.10 a.m. Here, Ext. P-12 i.e. arrest memo dated 22-6-2011 of Rahul
alias Govind made no mention of any injury on Rahul's foot despite
mentioning an old firearm wound on the left elbow in Column 9 of the
arrest memo, which is where the police noted the injuries. It was urged
that this was an irreconcilable circumstance against the prosecution's
case that Rahul had a bullet injury on his left leg.
19. It was submitted that Manoj's arrest then took place at 10.05
a.m. from his house (Ext. P-15). His disclosure statement was recorded
at 10.15 a.m. (Ext. P-16) and seizures were made at 10.35 a.m. (Ext. P
-17). The arrest memo of Manoj (Ext. P-15), however, does not record
the injury on the elbow even while it notes signs of an injury on the
nose in Column 9 of the arrest memo which is where the police is
supposed to record injuries present on the body of the accused at the
time of arrest. The prosecution case is that on 22-6-2011 from 6.00
a.m. till 4.40 p.m. various seizures were made and documents were
prepared. However, there is evidence to show that a press conference
was held in the office of DW 3 Sanjay Rana, IG, Indore between 12.30
p.m. to post 1.00
p.m. and even before the press conference, PW 31 IO had informed him
that the investigation was done and Neha was arrested, and that he
had conducted the seizure procedure from the accused. This falsifies
the story of the recovery of shoe at the instance of Rahul Ext. P-21
[reliance is placed on DW 3 and DW 5].
20. Ms Prakash contended that PW 31 IO deposed to interrogating
Rahul on 23-6-2011 before two witnesses - but did not name them.
Rahul reportedly disclosed that he had kept his clothes and knife in a
bag in his motorcycle and Manoj had broken the stolen mobile and
camera and thrown them near a Maruti showroom. He then prepared
the information memo (Ext. P-28) at 7.50 a.m. He interrogated Manoj
in the presence of two witnesses (who he did not name) who allegedly
confessed that he had concealed the clothes and shoes worn by him in
his father's almirah and had thrown a broken mobile near the Maruti
showroom at Rau. He then prepared information memo (Ext. P-31),
recorded at 8.05 a.m. PW 31 also interrogated Neha in the presence of
two witnesses (who were again, not named) who revealed that she had
kept her clothes and sandals worn by her in the dicky of her Scooty. He
then prepared information memo (Ext. P-34) at 8.15 a.m. It was
submitted that since the accused had made their disclosures on the
date of their arrest, it appears strange and unnatural that truncated
recovery statements would be given at different stages of investigation.
The counsel urged that there was no explanation as to why PW 31 IO
does not reveal either the time of recording of statements or the names
of the witnesses.
21. Commenting on the recoveries made on 23-6-2011, it was
submitted that no explanation was furnished as to why truncated
recoveries were made on different dates, as was claimed by the
prosecution. Further, the witness to these recoveries PW 7 Sandeep
Narulkar, appears to be a stock witness who stated that he reached the
police station at 8.45 a.m. on 23-6-2011 i.e. after the disclosure
statements (Exts. P-28, P-31 and P-34) were recorded. In the chief
examination, this witness deposed that Rahul disclosed before him that
he could get the clothes, knife, lens of camera recovered. Manoj
disclosed keeping his clothes in his father's house and Neha about
having kept her clothes in her vehicle parked behind a hospital. Then
police prepared memos Exts. P-28, P-31 and P-34 respectively and
recovered articles of which memos were prepared as Exts. P-29, P-31 &
P-34 respectively. It is pointed out that PW 7 does not say anything
about a lady police officer in the team which would have been required
on account of involvement of female accused Neha. It was urged that
non-examination of the other witness (Prakash Ichke) assumes great
significance and without any explanation for his non-examination it
cannot be said that the recoveries are reliable.
22. The counsel casts serious doubts as to the recovery by police on
22-6-2011 and 23-6-2011. She particularly pointed to the fact that a
photograph of Rahul wearing a black-beaded bracelet was found from
his house and seized as Ext. P-14. This was not made pursuant to any
disclosure and apparently was seized during the process of seizing
other items. During the cross-examination of PW 31 IO, a suggestion
was made that this picture was clicked when the bracelet was forced to
be worn by the accused. The IO denied the suggestion.
Likewise, a photograph of Manoj, wearing sunglasses was seized from
his house and exhibited as Ext. P-17. This was in the course of his
disclosure statement leading to recovery of other articles. However, in
Rahul's case, there was no disclosure statement. Neither of the seizure
memos mentioned from where in the premises, these articles were
found. Further, the recoveries were not spoken about in the depositions
of the recovery witnesses.
23. It was next argued that neither PW 3 nor PW 6 said anything
regarding the sealing of the seized items (Exts. P-11, P-14 and P-17) in
their presence on 22-6-2011 and 23-6-2011. Similarly, the witness (for
recoveries made on 23-6-2011) PW 7, did not mention who placed
seals on the items Exts. P-29, P-30, P-32, P-33 and P-35. PW 6 could
not recollect the sealing of the articles on 22-6-2011. Likewise in Ext. P
-35 disclosure by Neha and recovery of items on 23-6-2011 do not
mention the sealing of the items. The counsel also compared the
depositions of the panch witnesses with the evidence of PW 12
Tahsildar and PW 36 Mulayam Singh Yadav (Head Constable, MIG). It
was submitted that these witnesses nowhere mentioned the particulars
of sealing, what kind of seals were placed or the signatures of persons,
who had witnessed the recovery and sealing of the articles. It is
therefore argued that the recoveries on 22-6-2011 are unreliable.
24. The learned counsel submitted that in all likelihood, the accused
were in police custody for a longer period than what was projected,
which raises doubts over the veracity and voluntariness of the
disclosure statements by them. She also submitted that recoveries of
next day i.e. 23-6-2011 are similarly unreliable as they were not
recorded in the presence of witnesses PW 7 and Prakash Ichke. PW 7
arrived at the police station that day at 8.45 a.m., the disclosure
statements however were recorded earlier between 7.50 and 8.15 a.m.
- evidenced by Exts. P-28, P-31 and P-34. Signatures of the witnesses
were taken on those documents. It was submitted that the oral
evidence completely undermines and falsifies preparation of documents
at the date and time mentioned. Therefore, recoveries are dubious
inasmuch as they purport to have been made pursuant to disclosure
statements on the same day, which were recorded before the witnesses
even reached the police station. Another suspicious circumstance
according to the counsel was that recoveries were made in the
afternoon, starting from 2.45 p.m. after a gap of 6 hours. The timing of
Exts. P-29, P-30, P-32, P-33 and P-35, are shown in this regard. It is
argued that when the disclosure statements were recorded latest at
8.15 a.m., the police did not offer any explanation why the recoveries
took place in the afternoon only after a lapse of six hours.
25. It was further submitted that recoveries are also suspect
because the details were published in newspapers, both on 22-6-2011
and 23-6-2011. The learned counsel relied on Ext. D-4, published on 22
-6-2011 which mentions the recovery of a pistol and knife from the
accused. These recoveries were made that day at 9.30 a.m. and 10.35
a.m. Importantly, the learned counsel argued that the chain of custody
of the shoe allegedly belonging to Rahul which was seized from an open
place within jurisdiction of Annapurna Police Station on 22-6-2011 as
propounded by the prosecution, is suspect as it was
soon photographed in a newspaper published on 23-6-2011, while in
the hands of the police officer. Reliance is placed on Ext. D-6 in this
regard.
26. It was next pointed out that the accused were produced before a
Magistrate on 23-6-2011. The record reveals that the arrests were
made in the morning of 22-6-2011, and several articles were seized
pursuant to the disclosure statements of the accused and consequently,
recoveries effected. However, the Magistrate was not shown these
articles nor was any memo produced before the Magistrate at the time
of the production of the accused on 23-6-2011. This procedural
irregularity as highlighted by the Senior Counsel is contrary to Section
102(3) CrPC which requires every police officer to forthwith report
seizure of any article to a Magistrate having jurisdiction. The counsel
relies on Umesh Tukaram Padwal V. State of Maharashtra ², to say that
non-compliance is fatal to the prosecution story.
27. Ms Prakash also contended that PW 10 Dilip Sen is a chance
witness whose testimony is unreliable because it contains
contradictions and material improvements. It contains a material
contradiction regarding his reporting to the police about seeing all the
three accused. In his examination-in-chief, he stated that he read
about the incident in the newspaper and therefore, went and informed
the police about the incident. In his cross-examination, however, he
said that he did not read the newspaper and went to the police station
without reading the newspaper. He also mentions going to the police
station for another reason (to get a gumasta licence) and upon
overhearing discussions going on there about this case, he volunteered
information. Further his testimony is unbelievable as, given the
description of the scene of crime, the clothes of the accused should
have also been smeared with blood. The recovery memos of the clothes
of the accused (Exts. P-29, P-32 and P-35) show that the clothes worn
by the accused on the day of the incident were light in colour on which
blood would have been easily visible. Moreover, PW 10 explained his
presence near the place of occurrence since he wanted to check if
House No. 23 was available for rental purposes. However, the
prosecution has not sufficiently established his presence near the place
of occurrence as the owner of House No. 23 was not examined and no
other evidence was led to confirm the presence of PW 10 at the place of
occurrence. PW 10 further improved from his statement under Section
161 CrPC (Ext. D-7) with respect to Neha's presence at the place.
28. Likewise, the learned counsel submitted that PW 8 Achyutmal
Tejwani (whose deposition was relied on by the prosecution, to say that
he treated Manoj), is an unreliable witness. His credentials as a medical
practitioner, were doubted : the counsel relied on the witnesses' cross-
examination and submitted that this witness had migrated to India
from Pakistan, and in all probability was beholden to the police.
29. The learned counsel submitted that the delay of 25 days in
conducting the test identification parade ("TIP") is unexplained. The
delay assumes significance since unveiled photographs of the accused
were published across newspapers starting from 23-6-2011. In this
regard, reliance is placed on Exts.
D-6, D-45 and D-48 which are newspaper articles containing
photographs. Furthermore, it was submitted that the procedure of the
TIP was questionable as Rahul and Manoj were made to stand together
in the TIP line-up. The identification memo does not record the
appearances of the other persons. Ms Prakash submitted that Rahul and
Manoj do not look similar - she relied on the arrest memos Exts. P-12
and P-15 to support her argument. PW 10 in his cross-examination
stated that some persons were tall, others were short; some were fair
and others, dark. Therefore, the combined TIP procedure was faulty and
could not have been relied on. In this regard, the counsel relied on Lal
Singh V. State of U.P. , Muthuswami V. State of Madras9 and
Mohd.
Abdul Hafeez V. State of A.P. 10 to say that in the absence of individual
distinguishing features, a TIP of the accused conducted after a
relatively long time may not be relied upon by the courts.
30. The learned Senior Counsel submitted that there was serious
doubt about the identity of Rahul, who was referred to as "Govind" in
all documents until the preparation of his arrest memo Ext. P-12 on 22-
6-2011. There was no reason why an alias for Rahul was associated
with him in the arrest memo. This raises doubt about the identity of the
individual. All documents relating to the medical treatment for the
bullet injury as well as the case proceeding (Crime No. 377/2011
registered by PW 29 crucially on the date of occurrence) refer to him as
Govind. These were Ext. P-103 - dehati nalisi at 10.30 p.m. on 19-6-
2011; Ext. P-97 - letter of police to District Hospital and report of
District Hospital, Indore after examination of wounds and referring him
to M.Y. Hospital; Ext. P-104 - crime details recorded at 11 p.m. on 19-
6-2011; Ext. P-105 - FIR of the shooting incident at 12.15 a.m. on 20-
6-2011; Ext. P-101 - case closure report on 29-6-2011; Ext. P-113 at
M.Y. Hospital signed by PW 32 Dr Nilesh Guru on 20-6-2011.
31. The learned counsel submitted that the non-identification by the
treating doctors (PW 26 and PW 32) of Rahul, or even of PW 30 R.S.
Makwana (of PS Annapurna) in TIP or in court, on the one hand, and his
identification by PW 29 Gourishankar Chadar (of PS Annapurna) in court
as Govind alias Rahul, assumes significance. Rahul was allegedly
admitted in M.Y. Hospital and there was ample opportunity for the
treating doctors, nurses, and other hospital staff to identify him. Their
omission to do so, raises serious doubts.
32. Ms Prakash argued that material was suppressed regarding
admission in hospital. In this regard, it is pointed out that Ext. P-113
only mentions the date of admission as 20-6-2011 and the name of the
patient is mentioned as Govind. There is no information on record
regarding the treatment given to him and the time of his discharge.
This is more crucial as no one from the hospital has deposed in order to
prove the identity of the person being treated. Likewise, chain of
custody of the bullet extracted from Rahul was not proved. In this
regard it was contended that PW 32 Dr Nilesh Guru extracted the bullet
and
deposited it in the medico-legal case section at M.Y. Hospital on 20-6-
2011. He did not depose to sealing the bullet at all. A sealed bullet was
collected by PW 30 from M.Y. Hospital from an unknown doctor on 23-6
-2011. The bullet was not sealed in front of PW 30. Therefore, there is
no evidence on record to prove who sealed the bullet and when.
33. It was urged that the Magistrate's remand order dated 23-6-
2011 omits mentioning of any injuries, especially on Appellant 2 Rahul
alias Govind which would have been visible since he had been
hospitalised. Furthermore, no MLCs of the accused persons were
produced during the trial. It was also contended that the prosecution
version regarding reporting of a false case and seeking medical
treatment and informing PS Annapurna to alert them of the bullet by
Rahul is unbelievable. Ext. P-97 shows that it was prepared at PS
Annapurna. From the document it appears that Govind was sent to
District Hospital with a forwarding letter that curiously has a note
seeking opinion on whether the injury is self-inflicted. This directly
contradicts the story of PW 29 that Rahul alias Govind had shouted and
alerted the police that he was going to District Hospital.
34. In terms of Ext. P-104 Rahul had signed the spot map prepared
on 19-6-2011 at 11.00 p.m. However, it is also the case of the
prosecution that Rahul was going to get his injured foot treated and
was admitted in hospital during that time. It appears that Constable
Dinesh took Rahul to District Hospital and subsequently to M.Y.
Hospital. That constable has not been examined and no reasons for non
-examination were given. The learned counsel submitted that there is
no material about how Rahul went from District Hospital to M.Y.
Hospital with a gunshot injury, or who took him from District Hospital
to M.Y. Hospital and who conducted his x-ray.
35. It was next argued that as far as seizure memo of the right shoe
is concerned, the memo (Ext. P-75) was drawn at PS Annapurna at the
behest of Abhay Tiwari, who too was not examined by the prosecution.
This makes the contents of the document inadmissible. PW 20
Harbhajan Singh did not remember the logo on the shoe. He also did
not depose as to which foot (left or right foot) did the shoe fit, or its
size. He did not say whether it was a sports or leather shoe and also
does not describe laces. PW 20 deposed that it was seized in his
presence, however, he does not mention whether the same was sealed
in front of him. PW 29 merely described that Abhay Tiwari found the
shoe and it was contended that this was hearsay evidence. Importantly,
there was no inquiry by the prosecution to prove that the seized shoe
was even the same size as Rahul alias Govind's. His foot size could
have been measured under Sections 2(a) and 4 of the Identification of
Prisoners Act, 1920 which was not done.
36. It was next urged that there were serious gaps in the TIP of the
jewellery held on 9-7-2011 by PW 12 Tahsildar. In this regard, it was
pointed that PW 3 Deepak Ranade deposed that those two bangles were
removed from Rohini's hand and one kudi (earring) was removed from
her body and handed over to him. During jewellery identification
proceedings, PW 1 identified Megha's
four (4) bangles and Rohini's two (2) bangles. It is unclear if bangles
identified by PW 1 included those handed over to PW 3. Further, if the
bangles of deceased Rohini given to PW 3 were not the same as those
identified by PW 1, the two recovered bangles from the accused were
not matched with those given to PW 3. It was also unclear if the
jewellery was mixed with other items having similar designs, as
required by law. Similar pieces of broken mangalsutra should have
been kept during the identification proceedings as well. Further, the
identification memo (Ext. P-1) did not indicate how many similar pieces
of jewellery were mixed along with the jewellery identified. There is
discrepancy in the evidence of PW 1 and PW 3 as to what was said to
have been stolen when questioned on 21-6-2011. According to PW 3,
on 21-6-2011 when he went along with PW 1 to the house of the
deceased, PW 1 only informed about the missing camera.
37. Challenging reliance on the DNA analysis report, the counsel
submitted that there was inordinate delay in sending items to the
forensic science laboratory ("FSL"). The items seized on 23-6-2011
were sent for examination to the FSL on 13-7-2011 (after 20 days) as
seen by Ext. P-115. This delay was not explained by the prosecution.
Therefore, it was urged that records of the police malkhana and
conditions of safekeeping of items were important in this case. Also,
statistical analysis was not conducted which is an integral part of the
scientific process. The lack of cross-examination of the DNA expert PW
35 Dr Pankaj Shrivastava on this was argued to be immaterial since this
goes to admissibility of the DNA report as scientific evidence and this
Court should consider this serious gap in the scientific process. The
counsel submitted that blood reference samples of the deceased were
not collected and tested. The blood collected on cotton swabs found
next to the dead bodies at the crime scene were used as reference
samples, which is unreliable. Lastly, the counsel urged that no
laboratory records were submitted - PW 35 mentioned that in the
observation sheet details of the samples received and the testing were
noted. This sheet was not submitted with the laboratory report. Also,
electropherograms were not submitted with the laboratory reports.
38. Turning next to the ballistic reports and the prosecution's claim
that the bullet extracted from Rahul's foot, and that recovered from
Megha's body were fired from the same weapon, it was argued, that
these circumstances were not proved, because of the unreliability with
regard to the manner of Rahul's arrest, doubts about his identity,
manner of seizure of the bullet from his foot, its sealing, custody, and
production in court. The counsel submitted that the articles were
received by the ballistic expert only on 14-7-2011; the ballistics report
Ext. P-120 is dated 30-7-2011.
39. Doubts were expressed about seals on the items seized from the
crime scene, which included the fired cartridges. According to the
counsel their consequent matching with the test fire cartridge was
unreliable. It was urged that the presence of copper during the
chemical analysis of the shoe is unreliable since the shoe was seized at
Annapurna PS and the witness Abhay Tiwari was not examined.
Further, the live cartridge's primer cap (seized from the place of
occurrence) had fallen during examination by PW 16 Bheem Bahadur
who
was from the Arms Branch and had sealed the cartridge. He, however,
did not say that he had reloaded it. During the ballistics examination
however, it was found that Article A-6 contained a live 7.65 mm calibre
pistol cartridge which was marked LR1 (in Ext. P-120). The description
of LR1 states that it is a reloaded live cartridge. The seals of the Arms
Branch on the live bullet were intact when they were sent to the FSL on
13-7-2011 (Ext. P-115). These facts raised doubts about the chain of
custody of Article A-6 (the live cartridge) given the discrepancies in its
condition. Further, it is unclear as to what was used for the test firing
by the FSL : if the live cartridge was used, it would not be possible
since the primer cap had fallen off, making it unusable. The report (Ext.
P-120) did not mention the use of another test ammunition for the
firing test, whose description should have been provided as part of the
report to ensure that the same ammunition is being used. The counsel
submitted that the fired cartridges found at the left side and the legs of
the deceased were not photographed - as evident from scene of crime
report (Ext. P-77) and crime scene photos (Ext. P-56). PW 9 did not see
the bullet in his hand and said that it was small in size. It is not
explained how he recalls the calibre (KF 7.65) written on the bullet and
fired cartridge.
40. The learned Senior Counsel submitted that the circumstances
relating to lifting of fingerprints, their being forwarded for expert
examination, and the report, were not proved beyond reasonable doubt.
It is urged that with regard to chance prints found at the place of
occurrence, PW 5 Vishal Pandey did not mention signing of the
fingerprint slips. Elimination prints were not taken from anyone present
at the crime scene. To prove that fingerprints were of the accused, the
identity of the specimen prints were not proved since neither the
signature of the accused nor their photographs were affixed on Exts. P-
41, P-42, or P-43, contrary to what was stated by PW 13 Vijay Singh
Chauhan (constable) who mentioned that he took signatures of the
accused persons. The specimen prints were not taken before the
Magistrate on 23-6-2011, and rather on the next day (24-6-2011) at
PS MIG. Sending of fingerprints for examination : no witness (PW 13,
PW 24, or PW 31) has deposed anything suggesting that prints were
sent to the fingerprint branch in a sealed condition. The rule of
prudence of taking prints before the Magistrate under Section 5 of the
Identification of Prisoners Act, 1920 was breached. Further, specimen
fingerprints of the accused were sent to the fingerprint branch after an
unexplained delay of 3 days i.e. 27-6-2011 despite both departments
being in Indore. The fingerprint expert's report (Ext. P-84) is not
credible because elimination of the deceased's prints was not explained
by PW 24 K.K. Dwivedi (fingerprint expert) or in his report Ext. P-84.
Only the final conclusion of elimination has been written about. There is
no scientific evidence that fingerprints are unique for all individuals and
therefore, heavy reliance cannot be placed on it. It is only corroborative
in nature. Further, the counsel highlighted that the fingerprints were
not lifted from the knives, pistol and ornaments seized from the
accused. The counsel relied on Mohd. Aman V. State of Rajasthan11 11 and
Chandran V.
State of Kerala¹², , for arguing that fingerprint proof cannot ipso facto
lead to conviction.
41. The learned Senior Counsel then argued that the shoeprint
report (Ext. P-125) mentioned that the chance shoeprints were
incomplete and unclear, despite which the expert proceeded with the
examination and came to a finding of the prints being identical to F6
(right), G4 (right), and H3 (which does not specify which side, as per
Ext. 125). Rahul's foot impression was not taken as per Section 4 read
with Section 2(a) of the Identification of Prisoners Act along with Rule
822(4) of the Madhya Pradesh Police Regulations Rules. It was urged
that this was important in proving that Rahul wore shoe size 44. PW 5
mentioned that there was a lot of blood on the floor. Elimination prints
of shoes were not collected from PW 5 or anyone else present at the
scene of occurrence. At this point it is worth noting that among others,
five persons had entered the place of occurrence to act as witnesses to
the inquest proceedings. The scene of crime report (Ext. P-77)
mentioned that the shoeprints were bloodied and partial in nature. All
these cast doubts about authenticity and reliability of the footprint
expert's report.
42. Mr Shri Singh, learned counsel arguing pro bono on behalf of the
appellant Neha, supplemented the contentions of Ms Anjana Prakash.
He questioned the prosecution version about Neha's arrest. He
submitted that officially Neha's arrest memo (Ext. P-9) was prepared at
Devendra Nagar. When Neha was arrested, a personal seizure memo
(Ext. P-10) and a disclosure memo (Ext. P-11) was prepared. No
explanation as to why Neha's search outside the ATM (Ext. P-22) did
not yield the phone seized through Ext. P-9, was given. PW 31 IO
admitted that this was not recorded in Neha's arrest memo. Pertinently,
the prosecution neither conducted a technical investigation of the
seized phone nor provided any explanation as to why investigation was
not conducted in this regard. Further, DW 1 SI Deepika Shinde
admitted to conducting an analysis of the CDRs ¹³. The CDRs were not
produced before the trial court.
43. It was urged that these omissions impel the Court to draw an
adverse inference, under Section 114(g) of the Evidence Act, 1872
against the police, casting grave doubt over Neha's apprehension, her
arrest, and subsequent recoveries. Reliance is placed in this regard on
Noor Aga V. State of Punjab14 and Chunthuram V. State of
Chhattisgarh15
44. The learned counsel further argued that PW 4 Banno Solanki
(lady constable) was cross-examined on 30-9-2011 i.e. just three
months after the incident. In cross-examination, the suggestion given
was that Neha was brought to the police station on the evening of 21-6
-2011 by DW 1 SI Deepika Shinde. PW 4 was silent regarding her role
in searching Neha's residence on 22-6-2011,
though she claimed she was present during Neha's apprehension
earlier. PW 28, during cross-examination about DW 1's role, deposed
that he and DW 1 received an out-of-turn promotion. PW 6, too during
cross-examination, admitted that DW 1 was a part of the raiding team.
These facts were effaced from the record. This was consistently the line
of defence during the trial. Both courts below disregarded this aspect of
Neha's defence - though the involvement of DW 1, in the investigation
of this case was proved conclusively. Further, despite several
opportunities, the prosecution failed to explain the acts of DW 1 during
the investigation, or why her role was specifically erased. Reliance is
placed in this regard on Reena Hazarika V. State of Assam16 It was
urged that this warrants adverse inference against the prosecution,
creating doubt over its reliability.
45. It was argued that the testimony of DW 1 Deepika Shinde in fact
shows that technical evidence was analysed on the date of the incident
itself. This does not square with the complete absence of telephonic
evidence in the testimonies of the investigating team including PW 4,
PW 28, PW 31. Telephonic evidence about whether the accused spoke
to each other, or knew each other, or whether the deceased spoke to
any of the accused, or the triangulation of location was not collected
during the investigation and has been kept out of the trial. It was urged
that in its place, this Court now had to rely upon the ipse dixit of the
investigation team, knowing that electronic evidence was not only
available, but was surreptitiously used to Neha's detriment. It was
pointed out that PW 31 IO made no reference to the presence of
officials of the Crime Branch on 19-6-2011, 20-6-2011, or 21-6-2011.
However, PW 28, Vijay Singh Chauhan made reference to his Crime
Branch posting, and informing PW 19 Y.R. Gaikwad, what he (i.e. PW
28) saw on 22-6-2011. However, PW 19 in his testimony was silent on
receiving any information from PW 28 on 22-6-2011. DW 1's capacity
for conducting investigation was questioned on the ground that the
CrPC does not permit parallel/multiple investigations in the same case.
46. It was submitted that despite recovery of the "Oriflame"
document from Neha, the prosecution did not rely on the document as
an exhibit. The prosecution did not examine any official from the
company to provide any context whatsoever as to the forms, catalogue
or, perfume recovered from Neha's residence on 22-6-2011 (Ext. P-11).
There is no evidence to suggest that the form seized from Neha was
filled in by the deceased Megha; nor was the latter's signature
identified or proved.
47. The counsel stressed that the independent witnesses who
deposed to such a form do not indicate that there were any signatures
on it. PW 3 merely stated that a paper/document (of "Oriflame") was
recovered from Neha's residence. He did not indicate whether the form
was filled. PW 6 stated that certain articles including the form were
seized in his presence but did not indicate their nature/details. While
PW 3 identified the form in court, no question for the purpose of
identifying the handwriting on such form was put to him. The
signatures of the independent witnesses, as well as the
police personnel at the time of such seizure were not found on the
pullanda containing the form. The only witness providing any details
with reference to the "Oriflame" form is PW 31 IO. It was urged that
these "details" too were mere surmises of PW 31 untested during the
investigation or trial.
48. It was also pointed out that all questions put to Neha, relating to
the recovery of the Oriflame form, were denied. While PW 1, in his
examination-in-chief states that his wife was a consultant at Oriflame,
the form seized from Neha's house was not shown to him. Evidence in
this regard may have been forthcoming from him. In fact, neither PW 1,
nor any Oriflame employee admitted the handwriting of Megha. The
prosecution did not conduct any forensic examination of the form to
establish the alleged handwriting/signature of Megha. Further, PW 1
was also involved in a TIP for the seizures of articles seized, where
certain jewellery, allegedly belonging to the deceased, was purportedly
identified by him. Inexplicably the "Oriflame" form was not put to him
by the prosecution in these proceedings. Therefore, it is evident that
the "Oriflame" document does not connect the deceased, Megha, or her
relation of dealing with Neha as there was no investigation on this
document. Therefore, barring the ipse dixit of PW 31 IO, there is
nothing suggesting that the "Oriflame" form was filled for Megha, or
filled or signed by her.
49. Mr Shri Singh next urged that DW 1 Deepika Shinde had
admitted to going to the spot on 19-6-2011, based on a request made
by the Control Room. She also sought information from the officials at
PS MIG, and thereafter spoke to the deceased persons' neighbours.
However, DW 1 could not provide any details in this regard during her
examination-in-chief. Though DW 1 stated that she examined the CDRs
of the accused persons, she provided no specific details of such analysis
in her testimony. DW 1 also admitted interrogating Neha. DW 1 further
confirmed that she was informed by a source that Neha would leave her
house wearing a pair of jeans and a maroon top. This information was
received by DW 1 prior to Neha's arrest, and therefore presumably DW
1, by her own admission, was involved in the investigation even beyond
22-6-2011. Further, DW 1 stated that she shared the source
information with her colleagues and subordinates. PW 28, while giving
patently false testimony in court also stated that when he saw Neha at
LIG Tiraha, she was dressed in "black jeans and a maroon top". PW 28's
deposition shows how he allegedly spotted Neha, which is belied by DW
1's testimony. Despite such a deposition, the prosecution elected not to
cross-examine DW 1.
50. It was argued that DW 1 Deepika Shinde's presence during the
investigation was confirmed by PW 7's testimony. He is alleged to be an
independent witness to the recoveries from Neha's residence on 22-6-
2011. At Para 14 of his testimony and during cross-examination, he
admitted that DW 1 was a part of the raiding team - a fact that has
been kept out of the record. The counsel submitted that all these facts
can be simply answered by Neha's illegal custody before 22-6-2011. It
was strongly urged that Neha's personal search and the recoveries from
her residence were tainted and the records and seizures pertaining to
these purported proceedings could not be relied upon. The staccato
manner in which the purported record of the prosecution reflected
events taking place on 22-6-2011 indicated that the police fabricated
the record, resulting in Neha's false implication.
51. Mr Singh next argued that the prosecution did not prove any
prior relationship between the accused. Neither was any material
produced to suggest that the three accused knew each other or had any
prior plan, agreement or common intention to commit a robbery at the
place of incident. The prosecution admittedly had access to the CDRs of
the accused persons and could have demonstrated the fact whether
there was a relationship, which there was none. Either way the CDR
evidence was crucial to the prosecution and the lack of explanation as
to why it was not a part of the investigation casts doubts on the
investigation and its fairness. It was stated that while the official
investigation claimed that no CDRs were accessed (PW 31's statement
is relied on for this), the unofficial investigation (or, that material kept
away from court) conducted by DW 1 admitted having access to and
analysing the CDRs. This aspect lends credence to the defence that the
present investigation was improper and that it would be unsafe to rely
upon it to render findings of the accused's guilt. Reliance is placed on
Suresh Sakharam Nangare V. State of Maharashtra¹7 in this regard.
52. It was further argued that while convicting Neha under Section
302 read with Section 34 IPC, the courts below failed to appreciate that
there is no material to suggest that she had any common intention with
the co-accused persons, much less a common intention to commit
murder. Further, the nature of Neha's conviction highlights that no
weapon was recovered from her; she did not suffer any injury and none
of her personal items of belonging were recovered from the crime
scene.
53. Supplementing Ms Prakash's arguments regarding PW 10, it was
argued that the testimony of this chance witness was unreliable due to
gaps and contradictions. PW 10's cross-examination revealed that his
examination-in-chief was an improvement over his statement under
Section 161 CrPC - the witness had embellished his version of the
incident, such as the fact of the injury of the accused persons, and
more pertinently, Neha's statement having arrived on her Scooty and
telling one of the boys to take the other injured boy to the hospital. PW
10 also contradicted himself regarding what brought him to the police
station and regarding the TIP. In his examination-in-chief, he stated
that a woman constable was present at the TIP, whereas during cross-
examination, the witness stated that no woman constable was present
at such proceedings. Further, while PW 12 the Tahsildar, PW 18 Pratap
Kumar Agasia, and PW 11 Raju Sen, stated that both PW 10 and PW 11
appeared for the TIP together, PW 10 did not mention the presence of
PW 11 on such day. It was furthermore, urged that PW 10's credibility
was questionable as he appeared to be a stock witness - he deposed
during his cross-examination that he had previously appeared as a
witness for the prosecution in another case registered at PS Palasia.
54. Mr Singh urged that the prosecution did not give any
explanation about the delay in conducting the TIP proceedings, given
that PW 10 had informed about him sighting three persons on 20-6-
2011, barely a day after the incident; whereas the TIP was conducted
much later on 14-7-2011, by which date the photographs of the
accused had been published in newspapers. Reliance was placed on the
judgments of this Court which observed that a delay in a TIP must be
explained to place reliance on the testimony of a witness. Reference is
made to this Court's judgments in State of A.P. V. M.V. Ramana
Reddy18 and Rajesh Govind Jagesha V. State of Maharashtra ¹9. It was
submitted that apart from being delayed, and procedurally
questionable, the TIP conducted on 14-7-2011 did not yield any
information that was not already part of the public domain. The counsel
relied on Matru V. State of U.P. 20 where this Court observed that
identification tests are not substantive evidence and may only be used
for the purpose of helping the investigating agency with the progress of
the investigation.
55. It was argued that the shoeprint report (Ext. P-125) contains
contradictory statements, making it unreliable. Further, it did not
provide any conclusive material regarding the shoeprints found at the
scene of crime and were found to be negative for matches. It was
pointed out that for shoeprints obtained by the police, no moulds were
made from the available physical prints at the site and instead colour
photos of the footprints were obtained. The camera used for taking such
photos did not have the time/date, though such features were
available. During analysis of colour photos, the photographs were found
insufficient to reach any conclusion regarding the footprints in Ext. P-
118. It was argued that no individual shoe characteristics were found
from the prints. The print or design of the soles were missing in the
photoprints, and it could not be ascertained if the sole print of the
sandal at H3 matched with any print found at the scene of crime.
However, inexplicably the report concludes that E8 and E9 are photos
identical to H3. The shoeprint said to have been obtained from Neha
does not specify whether it is of the right or the left foot. It was
submitted that this Court in Pritam Singh V. State of Punjab 21 and
Balbir Singh V. State of Punjab22 found that footprints are a weak and
rudimentary evidence. The counsel urged that the evidence led by the
prosecution itself is weak and admits that there was insufficient
material to conduct the comparison, yet the comparison was carried out
as in terms of Ext. P-125, the examination report, SFSL, Sagar. Further,
the seizures relating to the shoeprints were only sent to FSL, Sagar on
13-7-2011-as seen from Ext. P-115-after an unexplained delay.
56. Mr Singh next argued that the fingerprint report relating to
chance prints was not reliable, and at best can only be used as
corroborative evidence. In this regard, it was argued that the
fingerprints obtained from the crime scene
were from an open place, accessible to the public, between the period
when the door had been opened by PW 5 till the arrival of the
investigating agency. While collecting chance fingerprints, no
fingerprints of the persons present/neighbours, or other members of
the household, were taken in order to eliminate such prints. PW 3, PW
5, and PW 24 were cross-examined on this account. They deposed that
the fingerprints of others to whom the place was accessible, were not
taken.
57. With regard to the report (Ext. P-84) prepared by the fingerprint
expert, PW 24 K.K. Dwivedi while conducting the analysis of the
fingerprints, some concerns were pointed out. Firstly, failure to describe
the method/procedure for lifting of the prints; secondly failure to obtain
elimination prints of other persons, for which no explanation has been
provided by the police; thirdly, that the expert was unable to provide
an explanation about the fact that none of the fingerprints analysed
matched those of any of the deceased persons; and fourthly, the expert
did not explain why the process under the Madhya Pradesh Police Rules
regarding dissection of fingerprint of corpses i.e. Rule 824, was not
followed while obtaining the prints of the deceased persons. It was
further urged that the expert did not provide a robust process for
analysis. The analysis described by fingerprint expert PW 24 claims to
rely on an 8-point method. The method followed by PW 24 merely
describes Level I of the ACEV Method (Analysis, Comparison, Evaluation
and Verification Method), used by the investigating agencies across
jurisdictions. Levels 2 and 3 of the ACE-V method were not followed.
The 8-point matching system, followed for the analysis, was argued to
be insufficient and not in compliance with such method. The counsel
relied on Hari Om V. State of U.P. 23 to argue that the question of
confirmation bias in this regard cannot be ruled out, given that the
prints of the accused were not anonymised while providing such
information to the expert analysing the fingerprints.
58. The counsel for the appellants urged that in the present case,
crucial circumstances, such as Neha's arrest (which constituted the
breakthrough in the investigation), the narration and deposition of the
chance witness PW 10, and the inconsistencies relating to the
recoveries, as well as the expert reports, lead to grave doubts. It was
submitted that in cases based on circumstantial evidence, the five
"golden principles" enunciated by this Court in Sharad Birdhichand
Sarda
V.
State
of
Maharashtra²4 have to be fully established and that
the Court should be convinced that the accused "must be" guilty and
not "may be" guilty. Further, the facts so established should be
consistent only with the hypothesis of the guilt of the accused, that is
to say they should not be explainable on any other hypothesis except
that the accused is guilty. The circumstances should be of a conclusive
nature and tendency. The circumstances should exclude every possible
hypothesis except the one to be proved, and there must be a chain of
evidence so complete as not to leave any reasonable ground for the
conclusion
consistent with the innocence of the accused and must show that in all
human probability the act must have been done by the accused.
59. It was submitted that the complete "blackout" of the role of DW
1, in the face of her admission to being involved with the investigation,
her receiving an out-of-turn promotion for solving the case, her
deposition that she had analysed the CDRs which were never produced,
or relied on, and her involvement before Neha's arrest, as well as her
involvement during the arrest and subsequent questioning, all pointed
to grave doubts about the circumstances which actually led to Neha's
arrest. It was strongly urged that this cast a doubt on her entire role.
Likewise, the piecemeal recoveries effected on two different dates, at
the behest of the three accused, the improbability of the accused
retaining incriminating articles like weapons, even while allegedly
getting rid of clothes, shoes, and vehicles, etc. cast doubts and
suspicions about the genuineness of recovery of the articles. It was
argued that all this, coupled with the untrustworthiness of the chance
witness PW 10-his contradictions in deposition, admission to being a
stock police witness, and who by his admission saw the accused for a
very brief while, as well as the inexplicable delay in holding TIP-
together undermine the prosecution story about identification of the
accused, and their alleged role in the crime.
Submissions of the State
60. Ms Swarupama Chaturvedi, learned Additional Advocate General
(AAG) for the State of Madhya Pradesh, argued that this Court should
not disturb the concurrent findings of the appellant's guilt recorded by
the learned Additional Sessions Judge, and confirmed by the High Court
in its impugned judgment³. She submitted that though the case is
based on circumstantial evidence, the prosecution was successful in
proving beyond reasonable doubt, every circumstance, and also in
conclusively establishing the guilt of the accused/appellants, on a
cumulative reading of all circumstances. She emphasised that the
conclusive nature of the evidence is such that any hypothesis of the
appellants' innocence is ruled out and that the only conclusion that can
be reached is that they and none others, are guilty of the crime of triple
murder, which they were charged with.
61. Heavy reliance was placed on the findings in the ballistic report,
wherein each circumstance was proved by the expert evidence. In this
regard, the counsel relied on Ext. P-25, the map of the crime spot
prepared by PW 31 IO which found two fired cartridges (at Point 7) and
one live bullet (at Point 6). The bullets were seized and recorded at Ext.
P-27, the seizure memo. The post-mortem report Ext. P-44 indicated
and forwarded a bullet, recovered from Megha's body. The recovery of
this bullet was also deposed to by PW 15 Dr P.S. Thakur. The bullet was
seized under memo Ext. P-127. Likewise, PW 32 had extracted a bullet
from Rahul's foot, in the early hours of 20-6-2011 at M.Y Hospital. The
bullet was deposited under memo Ext. P-113, in the hospital's medico-
legal cell. It was later seized under memo Ext. P-108 on 23-6-2011.
The seizure of a knife and pistol from Rahul's possession was recorded
at Ext. P-14.
This pistol was examined and test fired : a report, Ext. P-120 was given
by the ballistic expert, confirming that the spent bullets (the cartridges
of which were seized from the crime scene), the live bullet (also seized
from the crime scene), the bullet extracted from Rahul's foot, and the
bullet extracted from Megha's body, were all fired from the same pistol,
which was recovered and seized at the behest of Rahul (Ext. P-14). The
counsel also relied on Ext. P-52 the report of the armourer. It was
argued further that the seizure, sealing and proper custody of these
articles was spoken to by PW 3, PW 5 and PW 19, besides PW 31 IO.
There is neither any contradiction nor any gap in their testimonies;
further the ballistic report fully supports the prosecution version that
the bullets recovered were fired from the weapon seized at the behest
of Rahul, from his house.
62. The AAG argued that the ballistic report as well as medical
opinion establish the fact that except one injury on deceased Megha's
forehead, all injuries which caused death of all three deceased were due
to the two knives recovered at the instance of accused Rahul and
Manoj. The learned counsel relied on the testimony of PW 15, the doctor
who conducted the post-mortems on the deceased, as well as his report
(Ext. P-44). It was argued that from the crime scene till report and
thereafter, seals were maintained and the chain of custody of articles
was constantly intact, without any break. Seizure witnesses supported
these facts in their statements.
Regarding the shoeprints, the counsel for the State relied on
Exts. P-31 and P-32 (regarding seizure of shoes at the behest of
Manoj); Exts. P-34 and P-35 (regarding seizure of shoe at the behest of
Neha); Ext. P-21 (seizure on 22-6-2011); Ext. P-77 (inspection report
of the crime scene by PW 21 Senior Scientific Officer); Ext. P-115
(forwarding of these samples for testing); Ext. P-75 seizure memo of a
shoe recorded by PS Annapurna on 23-6-2011; deposition of PW 20,
who witnessed seizure of shoe; shoeprint report (Ext. P-125); and the
deposition of PW 31 IO. It was submitted that these witnesses did not
contradict themselves, and the prosecution had fully and satisfactorily
established the presence of the shoeprint reports, as well as their
matching, from the prints obtained from the crime scene. These proved
that the accused and no other were present in the premises, when the
crime was committed.
64. The AAG argued that the main motive behind the murders was
robbery. This was established by the recovery of the stolen articles
pursuant to the disclosure statements proved by Ext. P-10 and Ext. P-
11 which were seized after Neha's disclosure statement; the seizure of
articles pursuant to statement of Rahul (Ext. P-13 and Ext. P-14); and
recovery pursuant to statement of Manoj (Exts. P-16 and P-17). During
the TIP of the articles, PW 1 Niranjan Deshpande identified the looted
articles (such as jewellery items) as those belonging to the deceased,
which was also corroborated by the testimony of PW 12, the Tahsildar.
Furthermore, PW 4 Banno Solanki also supported the seizure of the ATM
card from Neha, when she was detained and later, arrested on 22-6-
2011. PW 27, a bank officer, deposed that the ATM card (Ext. P-98)
recovered pursuant to Neha's disclosure statement, was issued by his
bank. It was urged that all these proved beyond reasonable doubt, the
prosecution allegations that the accused had conspired and entered the
premises where
the deceased lived, with the motive of looting. The disclosure and
recovery of the looted articles, as well as their recoveries and later
identification, from the premises of the accused, disclosed their direct
link with the murders, and established that they were the perpetrators.
65. It was submitted that the appellants have sought to discredit
the prosecution by alleging that Neha was arrested earlier, and for that
purpose, exaggerated the role played by DW 1 Deepika Shinde. The
appellants sought to insinuate that that officer played a prominent role
in the investigation, and was taken off it, and that her role in solving
the crime, earned her an out-of-turn promotion. The AAG urged that
the appellants relied upon the statement of DW 1 Deepika Shinde, who
had never claimed that she had made any arrest in the present case. As
an officer of the Crime Branch she was involved initially in assisting or
helping ascertain the basic details, as the victims were women. DW 1
was posted with a unit called "We care for you", which focusses upon
women's protection. Soon after Neha's arrest, the IO felt that DW 1 was
not needed to do anything further. Her promotion was based upon her
contribution and role in many cases and this being just one for her
initial response cannot be considered that significant. It was submitted
that her hidden role, alleged by the appellants, is a bogey. While she
admitted to analysing call details, it is forthcoming from the trial
proceedings, that the call details had no role - much less any
significance, in the investigation, or pinning the accused, their arrest,
or recovery of articles at their behest. Therefore, the theory of the
appellants' counsel that Neha was not actually arrested as projected by
the prosecution, or as found, is without any basis, but merely
argumentative.
66. The AAG submitted that chance witness PW 10 witnessed the
immediate aftermath of the crime, as he saw the three accused leaving
after committing the crime. He described, at the earliest opportunity-
on 20-6-2011, that two boys (one injured at the ankle, and the other at
the elbow, and both bleeding as a result of the injuries) were sitting on
a bike, when a girl in a Scooty appeared, and asked them to go to a
doctor for examination. The so-called discrepancies highlighted by the
appellants, are neither material, nor of such importance to discredit the
entire version given by him, in the course of his deposition in court. It
was urged that nothing worthwhile was elicited in PW 10's cross-
examination. He clearly identified the three individuals, at the earliest
opportunity i.e. after knowing about the occurrence of the crime and
also unhesitatingly identified them in court, in the presence of PW 18,
the Naib Tahsildar. The latter witness corroborated the testimony of PW
10 as regards identification.
67. The IO also proved seizure of Suzuki service book and clothes, at
Neha's behest on 23-6-2011 which linked with the recovery of the
Scooty (again, at her behest) later on that day, from a place where it
had been hidden. The seizures were also corroborated by the testimony
of PW 7, who further identified the articles (Exts. Z-1, Z-2 and Z-3) in
court.
68. Ms Chaturvedi submitted that the fingerprint expert's evidence
unerringly pointed to all appellants' complicity and guilt. It was
highlighted
that four sets of fingerprints were lifted, by PW 24 (i.e. Ext. P-80) on 19
-6-2011. The fingerprints of the deceased (Ext. P-81, Ext. P-82 and
Ext. P-83) were lifted on 20-6-2011, by Constable Dinesh. The
fingerprints of the three accused/appellants were obtained on 24-6-
2011 (Ext. P-41, Ext. P-42 and Ext. P-43) by PW 13 Constable Vijay
Singh. His deposition was sought to be discredited by the appellants,
by pointing out that while the fingerprint samples were obtained,
according to him, the accused had signed on the forms (but which were
not actually found); and further, that the forms did not contain the
photographs of the accused. The learned AAG pointed out that the form
used, is the one as required in the Madhya Pradesh Police Manual, and
there is no requirement of a witness, at the time of obtaining
fingerprint samples. Furthermore, the cross-examination of this witness
was not worthwhile as nothing significant was elicited from them.
69. The AAG emphasised that the report of the fingerprint expert
(Ext. P-84) dated 11-7-2011 by PW 24 K.K. Trivedi, fully supported the
prosecution. It established that four fingerprints could be developed
and compared with chance fingerprints found at the crime scene. The
report clearly stated that two fingerprints lifted from the site (A and B)
matched with the sample fingerprint of Rahul; fingerprint D matched
with the fingerprint of Manoj and fingerprint E matched with the
fingerprint of Neha. PW 17 Satyanarayan Patel had photographed the
crime scene, including the spots where prints were collected, which
corroborated beyond any doubt, that the appellants were present at the
crime scene.
70. It was argued that a crucial circumstance that has to be
considered is that appellants Rahul alias Govind and Manoj were also
injured. PW 30 R.S. Makwana, ASI who was posted at Annapurna PS
stated that Appellant 2 Rahul alias Govind's leg was wounded. This was
also informed to TI Gaurishankar Chadar, who wrote dehati nalisi (Ext.
P-103); Crime No. 377/11 under Sections 294, 307, 34 IPC was
registered. PW 26 Mukesh Bhachawat deposed that on 19-6-2011
Constable Dinesh of Annapurana PS brought accused Rahul; he found
an injury on his right toe, which had a charring firearm wound. The
statement of the IO was that on the basis of information received from
Rahul, a shoe (size 44) for the left leg was recovered in the presence of
witnesses from the nearby RTO Office. Both the shoes which were
seized were brown-coloured with three holes and seized within the
jurisdiction of PS Annapurna. One shoe had a gunshot mark and the
other shoe belonged to Rahul. From the statement of the medical
officer, the right toe of right leg of Rahul alias Govind had a gunshot
injury and the recovered right shoe had a gunshot hole. Rahul's medical
report supported the fact that he had sustained one gunshot injury on
the toe of his right leg.
71. It is argued that the DNA reports established that the
bloodstains found on shoes and clothes of the accused, matched the
body fluid of the deceased. The DNA report, coupled with deposition of
PW 35 established that body fluid of deceased Megha was found on
Rahul's articles (Exts. F-4, F-5); body fluid of deceased Ashlesha was
found on Manoj's articles (Exts. G-1, G-3); and Neha's sandal (Ext. H-
2) had traces of deceased Megha's body fluids.
72. The learned counsel argued that the facts of the case were
proved by the prosecution beyond reasonable doubt to indicate that the
accused and none else, were the three persons who had committed the
crime for which both courts below had convicted them. It was argued
that no prosecution can prove facts perfectly and that some lapses or
inconsistencies are bound to occur, given the tricks memories play
because of which witnesses may not recollect events perfectly or in
chronological order. To make her point, the AAG relied on the
observations cited by this Court in Iqbal Moosa Patel V. State of
Gujarat25
73. It was lastly argued that the appellants offered no explanation
when the incriminating circumstances were put to them, under Section
313 CrPC. It was stressed that this Court in many decisions has in fact
held that examination of accused under Section 313 CrPC manifests the
principles of natural justice- audi alteram partem, by curtailing all
interferences at that stage from the counsel, prosecutors, witnesses,
third parties, etc. The accused may be asked to furnish some
explanation as regards the incriminating circumstances associated with
him, and the court must take note of such explanation. Therefore, by
essentially establishing a dialogue between the accused and the trial
court, the examination of the accused under Section 313 CrPC is not a
mere formality and the answers given by the accused have a practical
utility. It was submitted that the complete lack of any explanation,
much less a reasonable explanation, only meant that the accused could
not justify their conduct; they had no argument to offer.
74. In view of these submissions, the AAG concluded that this Court
should not interfere, under its special leave appellate jurisdiction with
the concurrent findings of guilt, recorded by the courts below, based on
a full and fair appreciation of all the evidence and material on the
record.
Analysis and findings
I. Neha's arrest
75. PW 28 (Vijay Singh Chauhan) deposed that he saw Neha
loitering suspiciously at 6.00 a.m. on 23-6-2011, near an ATM. He
relayed this to PS MIG, where the information was received by PW 19
Gaikwad. The IO (PW 31), formed a team consisting of PW 13 (Vijay
Singh), PW 36 (Mulayam Singh), Constable Devendra and PW 4 (Banno
Solanki, the woman constable). This party went to the site, and
confronted Neha; her body search was conducted by PW 4 which
yielded Ashlesha's ATM card. The search memo (in which time recorded
is 6.40 a.m.) was produced as Ext. P-22. Neha was taken in for
questioning and later arrested.
76. PW 28's testimony is supported by PW 4, PW 31 and PW 36.
However, deposition of PW 19 (Y.R. Gaikwad) is silent about the
reporting of Neha's suspicious activity - and what was deposed by PW
28, as corroborated by others. Constable Devendra was not examined.
This omission is per se, insignificant because while proving certain facts
and events if by and large, witnesses are consistent, any omission can
be overlooked.
77. Nevertheless, a few aspects urged by the appellants with respect
to the events proximate to, and surrounding Neha's arrest bear
scrutiny. DW 1 Deepika Shinde (who was promoted as Inspector when
she deposed) - admitted to analysing call detail records and
importantly, to receiving information-from - an undisclosed "source"-
that Neha would be at the spot-from where she was ultimately
arrested on 22-6-2011, and that she would be in jeans and a maroon-
coloured top. DW 1 deposed that she had received this tip off prior to
Neha's arrest i.e. before 6.30 a.m., and she shared this information
with the police. PW 28, however, denied the involvement of DW 1.
During the trial, the defence had relied on certain documents - notably
Ext. D-32 and Ext. D-46, to say that DW 1 received an out-of-turn
promotion for her role in solving the crime. That out-of-turn promotion
was given to DW 1 and PW 28, was admitted by both of them. It is
evident, therefore, that DW 1 received prior information regarding
Neha's likely whereabouts and further details even to the extent of a
description of her attire. The prosecution's studied silence with respect
to her role is not just mystifying but is a matter of concern.
78. The prosecution sought to establish through the testimonies of
the IO as well as PW 3 (Deepak Ranade) and PW 6 (Triyambak alias
Prafulla), that Neha was taken to the police station and questioned.
They then proceeded to Neha's house. As per the IO's testimony, the
raiding party included PW 19 and PW 4. The further prosecution case in
the statements of PW 31, PW 3 and PW 6 was that Neha was
interrogated on the way to her house and later arrested, after which her
disclosure statement was recorded leading to the recovery of the stolen
articles at her behest. At this instance also there was not even a slight
whisper by any prosecution witness about DW 1 Deepika Shinde's role.
79. During her deposition, DW 1 affirmed that she had gone to the
crime scene on 19-6-2011 itself. She also admitted that:
"I had analysed call records in the instant case. Today, I cannot
tell as to which call and as to how it was analysed by me. I had not
investigated the instant matter. I recall that I had interrogated one
accused in this matter later. I might have interrogated lady accused
(Neha Verma) present in the court is the same person whom I had
interrogated."
80. Later, DW 1 was unable to state the precise time in terms of
number of hours after the incident when she had interrogated Neha.
However, she was clear that she did so after Neha's arrest by PS MIG.
She further clarified that she had "interrogated Neha Verma in MIG
Police Station itself". PW 7 Sandeep Narulkar who concededly joined the
investigation as a panch witness on 23-6-2011, admitted in the cross-
examination that DW 1 "Police Sub-Inspector was not with us, she was
in other vehicle". This witness was cross-examined on 2-3-2012 but he
failed to identify her on that day. He, however, admitted that he could
not remember how many lady officers were present during the
investigation on 23-6-2011 i.e. the day on which he was asked to
present as a witness.
81. As observed earlier, an interesting feature is the fact that close
on the heels of the arrest of the present appellants and recovery of
incriminating
articles, the Police Department promoted some of its officers and
employees including DW 1 and DW 28. Both these personnel did not
belong to the MIG Police Station but were positioned in the Crime
Branch. Ext. D-30 (proved by DW 4 Pawan Srivastava, Inspector
General of Police who had issued it) which was placed on record during
the cross-examination of PW 1, is the order issued by the office of the
Senior Superintendent of Police, District Indore on 26-6-2011 bearing
S. No. SSP/Indore/PA/Reward/11/2005A It inter alia pertinently reads
as follows:
"In the afternoon on 19-6-2011, gruesome murder of Bank Officer
Niranjan Deshpande's wife Megha Deshpande, daughter Ashlesha
Despande and mother-in-law Rohini Fadke residing in the first floor
of House No. 24, Shrinagar Main Colony in posh area of the city was
committed by stabbing with knife. Total 22 stab wounds were found
on the person of Ashlesha.
On coming to know about this triple murder, within no time
residents near to the place of incidents gathered, the crowd was so
big which created law and order problem. The murders committed in
broad daylight, raised many questions on the functioning of Indore
Police and pubic started questioning that when women are not safe
in posh colony situated in the centre of the city then how the women
residing in other parts of the city will feel themselves to be safe. All
the police officers rushed to the place of incident and started taking
control of law and order. Electronic media and newspapers widely
aired the said incident which resulted in fear in the mind of public
also their trust in the police administration weakened. Keeping in
mind priority and gravity of the said incident, Senior Officers
constituted a police team of able officers and officials in which Sub-
Inspector Deepika Shinde (In-charge We Care for You) and R. 2906
Vijay Singh were specially included in the team and at the same
time the declaration of reward to the police officer solving the
incident, was made.
Immediately after the incident, at about 20.00 hours in the night
on 19-6-2011, through Police Control Room, directions were issued
to Sub-Inspector Deepika Shinde to reach at the place of incident
i.e. 24 Shrinagar Main immediately. After reaching the place of
incident, she discussed with the family members and neighbours
about the people visited at the time of incident whereupon it
revealed that before the incident a friend (female) of deceased
Ashlesha was seen leaving her house and secret information about
her other activities were gathered.
Under the supervision of Manoj Rai, Additional District Crime
Branch Superintendent of Police, District Crime Branch and Jitendra
Singh, Dy. S.P., District Crime Branch, call details of Mobile Nos.
9981147765, 9669191385 and 9826635615 of deceased Ashlesha
Deshpande and Megha Deshpande respectively were obtained. Sub-
Inspector Deepika Shinde was deputed to analyse and gather
detailed information about college mates of deceased Ashlesha and
deceased Megha Deshpande's colleagues working in Oriflame
company who using her professional skill and technique,
noticed a Mobile No. 8103807143 regularly talking to deceased Megha
on the date of the incident and prior thereto stated location of the said
suspected mobile phone to be at the place of incident. Later Sub-
Inspector Deepika Shinde established through call details location and
IMEI search, the said suspected mobile was being used by Neha's
father Anil Verma r/o Indore and at present Mobile Nos. 9009090142 &
9826065288 stated to be used in the said mobile.
On 22-6-2011, through analysis of call details of the suspected
mobile number, Sub-Inspector Deepika Shinde, established Neha
Verma r/o H.N.10 Devendra Nagar, Indore to be connected with the
said incident. In addition, Sub-Inspector Deepika Shinde using her
information system and intelligent inputs, gather this information
that today on 22 (illegible) Neha Verma wearing black jeans pant
and maroon-coloured top has left home and on analysing the call
details of suspected Neha Verma, present location of suspected Neha
Verma to be near LIG Tiraha, Indore to R. 2906 Vijay Singh.
After the incident, not finding any clue or the incident despite all
out efforts for three days by the Indore Police, crisis of law and order
has been created due to pressure and protest from public, media and
other social organisations. In such circumstances, Sub-Inspector
Deepika Shinde by her all-out efforts and devotion for continuous 72
hours, established a lead in the form of Neha Verma for identification
and arrest of the killers and working on the same this triple murder
case was solved and succeeded in arrest of Neha Verma and other
Rahul alias Govind Maratha and Manoj Balai involved in the case.
While interrogating female accused Neha Verma extensively by
applying psychological method, SI Deepika Shinde extracted
information about accomplices and also extensively interrogating
other two accused, collected information about the incident which
led to solving in the case.
Sub-Inspector Deepika Shinde showing her proficiency in analysis
showing her proficiency in analysing call details and professional skill
with her hard work and devotion gathered and made available
information of identification, appearance, name and address of the
first suspect Neha Verma and her involvement in incident on the
basis of which only a direction for search for accused of the incident
could be fixed.
*
*
*
Sub-Inspector Deepika Shinde establishing identity of the
accused of the unknown accused in the said triple murder has played
a significant role in solving the case which shows her professional
excellence, perseverance and devotion for duty. Had she not
established identity of Neha Verma, accused in the said triple
murder case, arrest of the accused in the said case was impossible
and by her ability, she has established identity of the accused
persons and solving the said case, a good message went in the
public and their confidence was restored in police. In the past as
well, service of the Sub-Inspector has been excellent.
In view of the said brave and commendable work by Sub-
Inspector Deepika Shinde, under Para 70 of the Police Regulations,
she is recommended for out-of-turn promotion to the post of
Inspector to keep her morale high and in future, while discharging
her police duties with diligence and perseverance, she brings laurels
to the department."
82. Similarly, in reply to an RTI query by DW 6 Anil Verma (Neha's
father), the PIO, Police Headquarters at Bhopal sent a response (dated
22-5-2012), No. PH/10/Record/RTI/70/12/506/12. The material part of
this document, produced as Ext. D-46, is extracted below:
"Subject : Information under Section 6(1), Right to Information
Act, 2005.
Reference : Your application dated 29-2-2012, 16-3-2012, 23-3-
2012 and 26-3-2012. Kindly peruse abovereferred applications
information received sought on two points by you, is as under:
1. Photocopy of Committee Report dated 24-12-2011 regarding
out-of-turn promotion to Sub-Inspector Deepika Shinde, is enclosed.
2. On 19-6-2011, Smt Deepika Shinde, Sub-Inspector on
searching arrested Neha Verma, Rahul alias Govind and Manoj Balai,
the main accused of triple murder case of Bank Officer Nilanjay
Despande's wife Megha Deshpande, daughter Ashlesha Deshpande
and mother-in-law Rohini Phadke residing in House No. 24,
Shrinagar Main Colonv. under PS MIG. Indore Citv."
83. The admissions by DW 1 on three aspects i.e. (a) analysing call
details in respect of certain mobile numbers; (b) obtaining source
information from an informer which was passed on to MIG Police
Station; (c) interrogation of Neha after her arrest, in MIG Police Station,
thus stand proved. PW 7's deposition also suggests that DW 1 was with
the investigation team even on 23-6-2011 and hence, provides
independent corroboration in supporting the appellants' arguments in
this regard.
84. DW 1's role in the pre-arrest, intelligence information gathering,
the arrest, interrogation of Neha, which the prosecution tried to
studiously keep away from the court thus, leads one to conclude that
its version with respect to apprehension and arrest of Neha are not
believable. It is also a matter of record that DW 3, the then Inspector
General of Police Sanjay Rana admitted that the Police Department had
issued Ext. D-32 on 4-10-2011 containing a list including at SI. No.
26-an unnamed informant-of persons given awards for their
contribution. In the present case, all these materials i.e. evidence of
DW 1 and DW 7 as well as the documents issued by the Police
Department/State Government itself, clearly point towards the
involvement of DW 1, not merely at a peripheral stage, but on a
pervasive basis, even after, in regard to the enquiry in the immediate
aftermath of the crime, gathering intelligence information with respect
to the probable accused; analysing call details, participating in the
arrest, interrogation of the accused and even an involvement with
further investigating steps leading to recovery of articles.
85. DW 6 Anil Verma (Neha's father) in his statement had deposed
that Neha was taken away for questioning much earlier, on 19-6-2011
itself. He deposed that on 21-6-2011 one Kishan Panwar from Crime
Branch went to him and said that Neha was using a stolen mobile
phone for which an inquiry was being conducted. At his behest, DW 6
asked Neha to reach home immediately. Once she reached, DW 6
contacted Kishan Panwar and informed him about her return from the
office. He reached DW 6's house 15-20 minutes later with DW 1. They
checked Neha's mobile phone and then left the place stating that Neha
would be taken for about an hour and a half for inquiry. DW 1 did not
disclose where she would be taken but allowed the witness DW 6 to
accompany them at a distance. According to DW 6, Neha was taken to
SP's Office at Regal Crossing and taken upstairs. The witness was not
allowed to go there, and instead was asked to leave, at which point he
went home along with his son. He stated further that on 23-6-2011 at
7.30 a.m. or so he was asked telephonically to keep Neha's clothes
outside, as the police was coming to collect them. The police reached
DW 6's house in the evening at which point they took a maroon top and
one pair of jeans. The witness was cross-examined by the prosecution
to suggest that his deposition was false; he denied it.
86. What is evident from an overall reading of the prosecution
version as compared to the testimonies of DW 1, DW 3 and DW 4 as
well as the documentary evidence is that the "breakthrough", claimed
by the prosecution resulting from Neha's arrest on 22-6-2011 is not
correct. The police had knowledge about the sim cards of deceased
Aslesha and Megha. Apparently, the call details of these were analysed
by DW 1. However, the prosecution kept these details away from the
trial. Likewise, although PW 28 and PW 31 both elaborately described
how Neha was arrested (especially role played by PW 4, PW 19 who
relayed the information and the participation of PW 3, PW 6 as well as
PW 36), all of them were conspicuously silent about DW 1. Whereas DW
1 admitted, in no uncertain terms, at two different places, to having
participated in the interrogation of Neha and also having given
information regarding her likely whereabouts-including the clothes
that she would wear, leading to her arrest. The cat was out of the bag,
so to say when PW 7 admitted that DW 1 participated in the recovery of
articles on 23-6-2011, a day after the arrest of all the appellants.
87. Having regard to all these circumstances, the prosecution
version with respect to Neha's arrest and interrogation cannot be
believed. The suppression of these facts, from the court, attracts an
adverse inference that the prosecution's version with respect to manner
of Neha's arrest, and the role of DW 1, is unreliable.
88. The question which then arises is : What is the impact of the
rejection of the manner of Neha's arrest on the prosecution's case? The
appellant urged that, the entire story - i.e. disclosure statements and
the recoveries effected on 22-6-2011 and 23-6-2011, has to be
rejected. This Court is of the opinion that such a drastic approach is
uncalled for. Concededly, the present case is entirely based on
circumstantial evidence. The rejection of the prosecution version with
respect to Neha's arrest would mean that only that circumstance is held
not to be
proved. It is not that Neha's arrest provided sole foundation of the
prosecution case. In some ways, it is an entry point; its rejection would
mean that the Court should proceed cautiously with other evidence,
objectively determine whether all other circumstances were proved
beyond reasonable doubt, and whether in the end the guilt of the
accused and not others, has been so proved.
II. Circumstances relating to arrest of the other appellants
89. If the circumstances leading to Neha's arrest on 22-6-2011 be
disbelieved, what remains as a matter of the record is that she was
interrogated in the presence of PW 3 and PW 6 that day. It is necessary
to analyse the depositions of these witnesses. PW 3 is a relative of the
deceased, as well as Niranjan Deshpande (PW 1). He was present on 19
-6-2011 and witnessed the seizure and sealing of blood samples,
fingerprints and the articles found at the crime scene. He was also a
witness to the inquest proceedings. He deposed that the IO (PW 31)
asked him, in the morning of 22-6-2011 to reach the police station,
with some other person. PW 31, however, did not support PW 3 about
asking him to bring another person. Nevertheless, PW 3 and PW 6
reached the police station at around 7.30 a.m. Neha's arrest is shown
at 8.10 a.m.; the disclosure statement and recovery of two golden
bangles, a broken mangalsutra, 3 guriyas, gold pendant, an ATM card
belonging to deceased Megha, an Oriflame perfume bottle and an
Oriflame form (apparently with Megha's signature) were witnessed by
PW 3. He also deposed with respect to the arrest of Rahul (at 9.00
a.m.), disclosure statement by him and recovery of various articles i.e.
a pistol, a knife, two golden bangles, part of a broken mangalsutra
containing a "guriya" and chain (weighing approximately 9 grams), a
black guriya, and Rahul's photograph (wearing a black-beaded bracelet
on his right hand). He further testified to the arrest of Manoj at 10.05
a.m., on 22-6-2011, his disclosure and pointing to articles, leading to
their recovery (Ext. P-16 & Ext. P-17). The recovered articles included
two golden bangles, portion of a broken mangalsutra, a knife and a
photograph with Manoj in sunglasses. PW 6 corroborated those facts.
90. PW 3's testimony was impeached pointing to the discrepancy in
time. He reached the police station after 7.30 a.m. Further, in cross-
examination, the witness was not able to depose about particulars of
the houses the police party went to, who were there, etc. Likewise, a
question mark was raised about PW 6. It was urged that the IO never
asked another witness to accompany PW 3. It was urged that these
witnesses are interested persons, as they are related to the deceased
and PW 1. Another argument regarding the recoveries on 22-6-2011
was that it is unbelievable that Rahul and Manoj would have kept the
looted articles and the weapons used to assault and kill the deceased,
given that they tried to dispose off other articles such as shoes,
camera, clothes, etc. and hide the bike and Scooty, etc. In the opinion
of the Court, the manner of arrest of these individuals, has been spoken
to by and large consistently by the two witnesses PW 3 and PW 6 who
have corroborated the IO's deposition. However, in respect of Neha,
what is not explained is why PW 4 (Banno Solanki) did not participate
in her arrest and search of her
premises. After having called PW 4, to ensure compliance with the law
that a woman police constable should apprehend, search and arrest a
female accused, the prosecution has offered no explanation as to why
PW 4 was not involved in the further proceedings. PW 4 admitted that
she was sitting in the car when the team proceeded to Neha's house.
Her presence in the team is confirmed by PW 3 as well as the IO. PW 4
herself does not corroborate the prosecution version about recoveries
made from Neha's house.
91. As observed earlier, the seizure memos detailing the articles
seized at the behest of the accused : Ext. P-11 (Neha) included an ATM
card which belonged to Megha, the deceased; Ext. P-14 (Rahul)
included looted jewellery (golden bangles, part of broken mangalsutra),
a country-made pistol, a knife measuring 35.5 cm, and a photograph of
him wearing a black diamond-like beaded bracelet on his right hand;
Ext. P-17 (Manoj) included looted jewellery (two gold bangles, part of a
broken mangalsutra), an iron knife of overall length of 34.5 cm and a
photograph of him wearing brown-coloured sunglasses. As per the
prosecution, these articles are related to their crime.
92. PW 3 and PW 6, both depose that after the seizure of the article
each of them remained with the police till 5.00 p.m. on 22-6-2011. The
prosecution version is that the arrest of all three accused persons were
completed by 10.05 a.m., their disclosure statements recorded, and all
the articles seized by 10.35 a.m. (as per Ext. P-17). There is no
explanation as to why further investigation was not taken up. All that
seems to have occurred on 22-6-2011 thereafter i.e. after 10.35 a.m.,
was the nails of the accused were cut and seizure memos prepared (as
deposed to by PW 3 and PW 6). The seizure memos in this regard are
Exts. P-18, P-19 and P-20. These were drawn in the early afternoon
:
Ext. P-18 (13 05 hrs); Ext. P-19 (13 : 15 hrs) and Ext. P-20 (13 : 25
hrs). The prosecution alleged that later at Rahul's behest the left shoe
worn by him during the incident was seized at 16 : 40 hrs from an open
area near his house (Ext. P-21).
93. The prosecution did not explain why there were breaks in the
investigation, given that the disclosure statements of all accused, and
consequent recoveries took place in the morning of 22-6-2011. It is
also a matter of record that though the accused were arrested that day
they were only produced before the Magistrate on the next day. In
other words, there was no impediment for the police to have proceeded
further or taken immediate steps to secure all evidence. This aspect is,
in this Court's opinion, important because even if the manner in which
Neha was arrested was to be discounted (as discussed earlier) the fact
that they were arrested in the presence of PW 3 and PW 6, further
proceedings and investigative steps including the seizure of articles at
the behest of the accused and pursuant to their statements, stand
proved. These are reasons why the events of 22-6-2011 (after the
arrest of the accused, and recoveries were made at their behest) have
to be segregated and seen differently from the events and
circumstances relied upon by the prosecution on other dates.
94. The credibility of PW 3 and PW 6, in this Court's opinion, cannot
be doubted. PW 3 was present on 19-6-2011, after discovery of the
murderous attack and PW 1 Niranjan Deshpande stayed with him after
reaching Indore. He (PW 3) was the deceased Rohini's nephew and
even performed the funeral rites of the deceased. Likewise, PW 6 lived
in Village Barlai which is about 45 minutes by bus, from Jaora (where
PW 3 resided). He knew PW 3 and had known Rohini for about 10-15
years. He reached PW 3's house when the latter asked him to
accompany him to the police station, since Neha had been caught and
her search had yielded an ATM card which belonged to Ashlesha. Of
these two witnesses, PW 3 is related to the deceased; however, PW 6
was not. Both witnesses corroborated each other's testimony and prove
the prosecution story about Neha's questioning, her arrest, disclosure
statement, recoveries made pursuant to her statement, as well as the
arrest, disclosure statements and recoveries made from Rahul and
Manoj. Furthermore, there is no discrepancy between their testimonies
and that of the IO (PW 31). Another piece of evidence is that PW 27, an
officer of Bank of India, Ujjain deposed that he issued a letter (Ext. P-
98) to the SHO containing the ATM card numbers. Megha's ATM card,
recovered pursuant to Neha's disclosure statement, was issued by his
bank; this was among the articles seized on 22-6-2011.
95. An overall analysis of the testimonies of PW 3 and PW 6 shows
that despite some inconsistencies, which can be put down to imperfect
or faulty recollection of sequence of events, or about the people
present, etc. their testimonies are credible. The effect of their
depositions is that they witnessed the disclosure statements of Neha,
Rahul and Manoj, and also witnessed the recovery of articles and their
seizure by the police, which were recorded in seizure memos (Exts. P-
11, P-14 and P-17).
III. Recoveries of 23-6-2011
96. PW 7 Sandeep Narulkar is an independent witness, who testified
to the disclosure statements of the accused Rahul and Manoj on 23-6-
2011 and the recoveries made pursuant to it. He deposed to witnessing
Rahul telling the police about the incident of 19-6-2011 and that in
that incident, a camera and two mobile sets were looted. Rahul gave
information about the camera, motorcycle, clothes worn, and knife used
at the time of incident; he said that he could get the articles recovered.
Then police prepared a disclosure memo (Ext. P-28) witnessed and
signed by PW 7. He said that on Rahul's direction, the police recovered
the motorcycle in question from beneath a small bridge over Pithampur
Road, one dark brown-coloured trouser, a full sleeved grey-coloured
shirt, and a bloodstained iron knife with metal handle (Ext. P-29).
Further, the police also seized a lens of a broken camera (Ext. P-30).
Both seizure memos (Exts. P-29, P-30) contained PW 7's signature.
When shown in court, he also identified the articles (brown-coloured full
pants, knife, one lens of broken camera). He further stated that police
interrogated Manoj before him and Manoj gave information about
robbery and murder, and about the clothes and shoes worn at the time
of incident and told that he could get them recovered. The police then
prepared memorandum Ext. P-31 containing the witnesses'
signature. As per Manoj's direction, the police seized a "firoji"-coloured
t-shirt, a black-coloured bloodstained full pants, a blue underwear and
a pair of micro-leather black-coloured shoes from his father's house;
the seizure memo for these articles (Ext. P-32) also contained his
signature. He identified the articles - clothes, shoes and a broken
Samsung mobile phone, recovered by the police from a vacant plot near
Maruti showroom under seizure panchnama (Ext. P-33) with the
witnesses' signature. He mentioned that the mobile phone's IMEI
number was 352450/03/115949/9.
97. PW 7 also witnessed Neha's interrogation where she provided
information about committing robbery and murder; and told the police
that she had hidden and could point out clothes and sandals worn at
the time of incident, and Suzuki Access vehicle (Ext. P-34). At her
pointing out, the police seized the Suzuki Access Scooty in question,
from behind the old OPD of M.Y. Hospital, from which : one service
book, one bloodstained pink full sleeve shirt with white lining, a light
blue-coloured jeans with three buttons on the back pocket, a pair of
ladies black-coloured high heeled sandals with brown strip attached at
the front and in the back of which, above the heels a chain was
attached containing bloodstains. These were seized by the police (Ext. P
-35) containing the witnesses' signature. PW 7 identified these articles
in court.
98. An overall reading of the depositions of PW 7 and PW 13 shows
that disclosure statements were made by all the accused in the
morning of 23-6-2011. However, the recovery of articles pursuant to
the disclosure statements were in the afternoon : Ext. P-29 (which
relates to Rahul and evidenced the seizure of the motorcycle, a knife
and his clothing) was at 15 : 30 hrs; Ext. P-30 (which too at the behest
of Rahul leading to seizure of a broken camera) at 16 : 40 hrs; Ext. P-
32 (pair of shoes, a t-shirt, a trouser and an underwear seized at the
behest of Manoj) at 14 : 45 hrs; Ext. P-33 (the other seizure at Manoj's
behest, of broken mobile phone) at 16 00 hrs; and Ext. P-35 (seizure
of clothing items, bloodstained black sandals and Suzuki Scooty, at
Neha's behest) at 17.30 hrs. The prosecution made no attempt to show
why piecemeal recoveries were made when according to its witnesses,
on the very first day i.e. on 22-6-2011, all the three accused had
disclosed their roles in the crime and their willingness to cooperate as
well as the recovery of the articles related to the crime - including
those belonging to them or hidden by them.
99. The second unexplained feature is why two sets of witnesses
were joined in the proceedings, on two consecutive dates. PW 3 and PW
6, witnessed the arrest of the three accused, their disclosure
statements and recoveries made on the first day i.e. on 22-6-2011. An
entirely different set of witnesses were called on the next day i.e. 23-6-
2011 (PW 7 and Prakash Ichke). Furthermore, one of the recovery
witnesses for 23-6-2011 (Prakash Ichke) was not examined. As noted
previously, the recovery witnesses received phone call at around 7-8
a.m. and were asked to report to the police station which they did at
around 8-8.30 a.m. on 23-6-2011; the disclosure statements made by
the accused on that day were recorded at different points of time but
before 10.00 a.m. However, the prosecution does not explain the
absence of any activity between around 10 a.m. and 1.30 p.m. when
the first recovery was made that day. PW 7
on his own admission stated that he was acquainted with the deceased
family; apparently, his cellphone numbers was known to them. As
noted earlier, he also admitted that DW 1 Dipika Shinde had
participated in the investigation proceedings that day.
100. All these factors, in the opinion of this Court cast doubt on the
prosecution version as to what occurred on the next day i.e. 23-6-2011.
100.1. Given that the accused were detained and arrested in the
early morning of 22-6-2011, that they made disclosure statements, and
there were recoveries that day at their behest, which were completed
that morning itself, the instalment or episodic procedure adopted by
the investigation, throws doubts about its veracity.
100.2. Nothing prevented the prosecution from acting on the
statements made by the accused and collecting all the evidence -
which by its admission was readily available and easily accessible
(given the knowledge of the accused which they were willing to share)
on the day of their arrest on 22-6-2011. Even if there were some
impediments, in terms of, lack of time or otherwise, the involvement of
an entirely different set of panch witnesses, without explaining why the
other witnesses who had evidenced recoveries on 22-6-2011 could not
be asked to participate, underlines that doubt.
100.3. The doubt gets further heightened by the fact that PW 7
knew the deceased family - and also claimed that his mobile number
was available with them. The IO (PW 31) does not in his statement say
anything about this. He was silent as to why PW 7 instead of the other
three was involved in the proceedings in 23-6-2011, and regarding the
non-examination of Prakash Ichke, the other witness to the recoveries.
100.4. Since all the recoveries were made from open areas with no
special features to highlight whether they were from certain hidden
spaces, such recoveries of articles cannot be equated with the kind of
recoveries made on 22-6-2011. This aspect is important because
clothes seized by the police (which according to the prosecution were
lying in open area, and thus exposed to elements) were articles from
which samples for DNA were collected to ascertain if there were any
matches with the DNA markers found on samples collected from the
deceased and the crime scene.
IV. Testimony of PW 10, the eyewitness
101. The prosecution relied heavily upon the testimony of PW 10.
This witness claimed that in the evening of 19-6-2011, he saw two
boys trying to start a motorcycle one of them was bleeding from the
ankle, and the other, at the forearm. He added that a girl arrived on a
Scooty and advised them that it would be better to go to the hospital.
The witness alleged that he had informed the police on the day after
the incident i.e. 20-6-2011. He stated in cross-examination that after
learning about the murder he claimed that he went to the police
station. Later, he said that he went there to obtain a "gumasta" licence.
He admitted that he did not read newspapers but added that when he
went to the police station, there was some discussion going on about
the murder, upon
which he volunteered to provide information and got his statement
recorded. The witness said that he owned a tea shop and worked as a
property broker; he later admitted that he did not have any registration
as property broker. He also admitted to having previously deposed as a
witness on behalf of the police in some other case. PW 10's presence
near the scene of crime, or rather after it, is explained by him,
somewhat unconvincingly, as his effort to ascertain if some property
was vacant. He is what one can call as a chance witness.
102. A chance witness is one who appears on the scene suddenly.
This species of witness was described in Puran V. State of Punjab²6 in
"4.
Such witnesses have the habit of appearing suddenly on the
scene when something is happening and then of disappearing after
noticing the occurrence about which they are called later on to give
evidence."
103. This Court has sounded a note of caution about dealing with
the testimony of chance witnesses. In Darya Singh V. State of Punjab27
it was observed that : (AIR p. 331, para 6)
"6.
where the witness is a close relation of the victim and is
shown to share the victim's hostility to his assailant, that naturally
makes it necessary for the criminal courts to examine the evidence
given by such witness very carefully and scrutinise all the infirmities
in that evidence before deciding to act upon it. In dealing with such
evidence, courts naturally begin with the enquiry as to whether the
said witnesses were chance witnesses or whether they were really
present on the scene of the offence.
If the criminal court is
satisfied that the witness who is related to the victim was not a
chance witness, then his evidence has to be examined from the point
of view of probabilities and the account given by him as to the
assault has to be carefully scrutinised."
104. In Jarnail Singh V. State of Punjab28 again, this Court held
"22. The evidence of a chance witness requires a very cautious
and close scrutiny and a chance witness must adequately explain his
presence at the place of occurrence (Satbir V. Surat Singh29,
Harjinder Singh V. State of Punjab30, Acharaparambath Pradeepan V.
State of Kerala³1 and Sarvesh Narain Shukla V. Daroga Singh32).
Deposition of a chance witness whose presence at the place of
incident remains doubtful should be discarded (vide Shankarlal V.
State of Rajasthan33).
105. In the opinion of this Court the deposition of this witness (PW
10) cannot be taken at face value. PW 10 improved upon his statement
made to the police and was confronted in this regard. His initial
statement to the police did not mention the presence of the girl (whom
he identified as Neha in court). Likewise, he improves upon his
statement, by deposing in court that the girl had asked two boys to
take one injured seriously to the hospital. In addition, his contradictions
as to what led him to the police station on 20-0-2011 - obtaining a
gumasta licence, or to report the crime; and his presence at the scene
of the crime - as a property broker checking vacancy of a property,
who admittedly had no licence for this business, are material. These
contradictions are serious inasmuch as they strike at the root of the
witness's credibility. His prevarications and improvements especially
about the presence of a girl are too serious and fundamental to
overlook. Very crucially this witness appears to be a stock witness. For
all the aforesaid reasons the depositions of PW 10 cannot be accepted.
V. Identification of Manoj by PW 8
106. The prosecution relied on the testimony of PW 8 Achyutmal
Tejwani to say that Manoj had obtained treatment from him. The
witness, during his deposition stated that he had studied from a
Science College in Pakistan. He admitted to not being licensed to
practise medicine, by the Medical Council of India; he also admitted
that he did not hold any permission to practise as a doctor, but ran
Kavita clinic. He identified Manoj in court, and said that on 19-6-2011,
Manoj had secured treatment for an injury on his elbow, and another
boy (who spoke in Sindhi) accompanied him. He proved Ext. P-37, the
slip issued by him, containing the prescription for Manoj, which was
seized on 25-6-2011 (Ext. P-36) by the IO (PW 31), who deposed to it.
107. This Court is of the opinion that PW 8 is not a reliable witness.
Apart from the fact that he is admittedly an unqualified professional,
and an unlicensed one - at best a quack, the counsel for the appellants
quite correctly point out that his previous links with the police cannot
be ruled out, for the reason that he migrated, later than during
Partition, from Pakistan. The probability of him practising his profession
under the shadow of police patronage, for some kind of quid pro quo
i.e. being a convenient witness, leaves a lurking suspicion. The police
did not involve him during the test identification parade; admittedly,
Manoj was in fact taken to him during the investigation. In these
circumstances, the testimony of this witness is not credible. This
circumstance is therefore, held not to be proved.
VI. Test identification parade of the accused
108. The prosecution relied upon the testimonies of PW 10 and PW
18 (Pratap Kumar Agasiya, Naib Tahsildar). Both deposed that PW 10
had correctly identified Manoj and Rahul by specifically tapping their
heads. According to PW 18, both the accused were made to stand with
10 other persons resembling them. The result of this identification
memo i.e. the test identification parade ("TIP") proceedings was
recorded as Ext. P-38, where
Manoj and Rahul were identified by PW 10, and Ext. P-40 where only
Manoj was identified by PW 11 Raju Sen. Likewise, PW 18 deposed that
in a separate proceeding recorded as Ext. P-39, PW 10 had identified
Neha from amongst five other girls who had similar physical features.
109. The main argument against the TIP proceedings was that it
was held after an inordinate delay. The appellants were arrested on 22-
6-2011 and remained in custody till 30-6-2011. It was urged that no
attempt was made to involve a Magistrate, to have their TIPs either at
that time, or thereafter and that the TIP was held only on 14-7-2011.
Ext. P-38, the TIP relating to Rahul and Manoj, records the names of 10
other men who the accused were made to stand with, anywhere as per
their choice. Each person was covered with a blanket, up to their neck.
It records that no police personnel were present when the proceedings
took place, and the witness correctly identified the accused.
110. A popular and widely used method of accused identification, by
witness, in criminal trials, is the identification parade. TIP procedures
are used, where witnesses who claim to have seen the accused at, or
about the time of occurrence to identify such accused from the midst of
other individuals, who bear physical attributes similar to them, without
any aid or other source. TIPs are meant to test witness veracity and
their capability to identify unknown persons. TIPs should normally be
conducted at the earliest possible time to eliminate the chance of
accused being shown to witnesses before the identification parade,
which might otherwise affect such witnesses' memory. TIPs are
conducted during investigation; however, there is no provision of law
enabling an accused to claim it as a matter of right, as held in
Malkhansingh V. State of M.P. 34 In Ramanathan V. State of T.N. 35 this
Court outlined the utility and weight of a TIP. There is no hard-and-fast
rule that delay or failure in holding the TIP ipso facto renders the
evidence inadmissible or unacceptable; it however, affects the
credibility and weight attached to such identification, as held in
Shyamal Ghosh V. State of W.B.
36
111. This Court has discussed earlier, with respect to credibility of
PW 10's testimony and why it cannot be taken at face value. Even
otherwise, the fact remains that he omitted to mention basic details
about the distance from between where he was, and where he saw the
accused. Further, his account suggests that he apparently saw the
accused, fleetingly. No attempt was made by the prosecution to draw a
sketch or to show the approximate distance from where this witness
(who is vital to its case) observed the accused. Given these facts, and
the delay (unexplained by the prosecution, which had by its account,
wrapped up the case by the end of June 2011) to conduct the TIP after
the accused's arrest, renders the TIP suspect. It cannot be said that the
TIPs conducted and the subsequent dock identification, by PW 10 of the
accused, are among the circumstances proved beyond reasonable
doubt.
VII. Recovery of articles and their test identification
112. On the day of their arrest (22-6-2011), the accused made
disclosure statements and pointed out to the police the places where
the articles looted, or those relatable to the crime, were kept or hidden.
These articles were seized on the same morning. In terms of Ext. P-11,
the articles recovered at Neha's behest inter alia were, two bent golden
bangles approximately worth Rs 50,000, a golden pendant, three
guriya, and part of a mangalsutra with chain and guriya approximately
worth Rs 22,000, Megha's ATM card issued by Bank of India. Similarly,
Ext. P-14 (recoveries made at Rahul's behest) evidences two bent
golden bangles having aeronuma design approximately worth Rs
50,000, a guriya, part of a mangalsutra with chain approximately worth
Rs 20,000. Lastlv. Ext. P-17 (recoveries made at Manoi's behest)
included inter alia, two bent golden bangles having round design
approximately worth Rs 50,000, a guriya, part of a mangalsutra with
chain approximately worth Rs 20,000.
113. On the previous day (21-6-2011), PW 1 Niranjan Deshpande
had reported that some articles - 2 ATM cards (Megha and Ashlesha),
Megha's mobile, Ashlesha's camera and specific jewellery items
(belonging to Megha and Rohini), were missing from the premises.
114. On 9-7-2011, a TIP of the articles was conducted, under the
supervision of PW 12 Zamil Khan, who was informed that the procedure
was to be conducted. He deposed that the TIP was carried out at the
Bharatiya Sangeet Kala Academy, Sector G, MIG Colony, where a
policeman from MIG Police Station reached with a sealed packet. One
Anil Soni also reached there with a similar packet. He said that two
packets were opened and their contents were mixed together.
Thereafter PW 1 reached the place; he observed the articles and
identified them. PW 12 deposed as follows:
"In the identification, identifier Niranjay Deshpande had identified
two gold bangles crumbled, one gold pendal (sic pendant), one
broken mangalsutra of a chain and stud with guriya, two gold arrow
like bangles, one broken gold mangalsutra, two gold designed
bangles, one broken gold mangalsutra of chain and one guriya."
115. The witness also deposed that after the identification was
completed, the jewellery was re-sealed and the jewellery items brought
by Anil Soni were taken away. He also identified the jewellery (which
had been identified by PW 1 before him) in court. PW 1 deposed among
similar lines. The only difference between the two depositions is that
PW 1 stated that PW 7 was present (as a matter of fact, he was not, as
is evident from the testimony of PW 7). Apart from urging this to be an
inconsistency, the counsel for the appellants also cast suspicion on the
TIP of the jewellery, urging that neither Anil Soni nor the Police
Constable who took the sealed items to the venue of the TIP was
examined. In this Court's opinion, these omissions are minor, and do
not shake the essential credibility of the proper identification of the
jewellery. In fact, during cross-examination, PW 12 clearly deposed
that besides him no one was present during the TIP of the articles and
that after PW 1 completed the
identification, he drew the memo (Ext. P-1) and kept the jewellery
separately; the rest were taken away by Anil Soni.
116. In this Court's opinion, a joint reading of the testimonies of PW
1 and PW 12, on the one hand, and the TIP proceedings on the other
(Ext. P-1, dated 9-7-2011) establish that the prosecution proved that
the identification of the looted articles, were correctly identified by PW
1. The accused's counsel had sought to urge that the articles were
common pieces of jewellery, without any distinctive features and that
PW 1 could hardly know these - particularly, jewellery of his mother-in
-law. If one keeps in mind that PW 1 had reported the loss of the
articles, and listed them specifically, in his statement which was given
to the police on 21-6-2011, their subsequent recovery, at the behest
and pointing out of the accused, and their correct identification by PW 1
before PW 12, there cannot be doubts on its credibility. During cross-
examination, PW 1 was not questioned about how he could identify
jewellery articles of his wife, daughter and mother-in-law.
117. There can be various reasons, why someone may be able to
recollect or remember jewellery or other valuables. There cannot be any
general assumption that a husband would not be able to remember or
recollect the personal articles of his wife, or that a wife cannot be
expected to recollect and identify the personal effects of her husband.
It all depends on the personality and individual traits of human being,
which uniquely differ from each other. It is possible that PW 1 had an
eye for detail; it is equally possible that he was present when the
valuables were bought; or yet, it is further possible that they were part
of a set, presented to the deceased individuals. The recollection,
reporting and identification of the mangalsutra, is more specific. PW 1
could reasonably be assumed to be aware of that article, belonging to
Megha, his wife. In these circumstances, the evidence relating to the
recovery of items belonging to the deceased, recovered from the
accused's premises at their behest, and their correct identification by
PW 1 during TIP were proved beyond reasonable doubt, by the
prosecution.
VIII. The circumstances relating to expert evidence regarding
the appellants' fingerprints
118. PW 21 Dr Sudhir Sharma, Senior Scientific Officer in Scene of
Crime Mobile Unit, deposed that when he reached the crime scene on
19-6-2011 at 6.35 p.m., the main door of the flat was open and not
sealed. In his deposition he mentioned the shoe marks and other
physical evidence which existed, and also was cross-examined about
whether they were tampered with. Additionally, he stated that a
computer was in the flat, which could have been seized, but he was
unaware as to whether it was seized or not.
119. PW 24 K.K. Dwivedi (the fingerprint expert) searched the crime
scene for possibility of lifting impressions of fingerprints. A set of five
fingerprints (i.e. Ext. P-80, "chance fingerprints") were lifted by him,
and signed by two witnesses (PW 5 and PW 9) as well as himself. He
claimed that PW 17 Satyanarayan Patel (photographer of crime scene)
had taken photographs of
the spots, from where the prints were collected. However, this is
neither corroborated by the testimony of PW 17, nor in the exhibits on
record.
120. Prints A and B were lifted from the inner back portion of door of
bedroom adjoining the bathroom on the first floor; Prints C and D were
lifted from the outer portion of door of bedroom adjoining the kitchen;
and Print E was lifted from the inner portion of the same door. Upon
examination, A, B, D, and E were found suitable for comparison.
121. The fingerprints of the deceased [Ext. P-81 (Megha), Ext. P-82
(Rohini) and Ext. P-83 (Ashlesha)] were lifted by Constable Dinesh on
20-6-2011. Constable Dinesh, however, was not examined by the
prosecution in the course of trial. The fingerprints of the three
appellants [Ext. P-41 (Rahul), Ext. P-42 (Manoj), and Ext. P-43 (Neha)]
were obtained by PW 13 Constable Vijay Singh on 24-6-2011 who
deposed in chief examination that he took the signatures of the three
accused persons (who were present in court and identified by him), on
their respective fingerprint slips, and later sent them to the SSP Office.
In cross-examination he deposed to being trained by the fingerprint
department and that he was competent to take prints. He observed an
injury/cut caused by a knife, on the ring finger of Rahul's right hand,
and no other injuries on the fingers of the three accused. It also
mentioned that he did not obtain any written consent from the accused.
122. The report of the fingerprint expert (Ext. P-84) dated 11-7-
2011 by PW 24 K.K. Trivedi, coupled with his testimony, forms the crux
of the prosecution case regarding fingerprints. On 27-6-2011,
fingerprints of the accused were received and compared with the
chance fingerprints by PW 24, who used the 8-point method and found
that Prints A and B matched with the index and middle finger
respectively of Rahul's right hand; fingerprint D matched with the
middle finger of Manoj's right hand, and Print E matched with Neha's
right thumb. The fingerprint report was sent to the Director, Finger
Print Bureau, Bhopal by PW 24 on 6-7-2011 which was verified by the
former vide letter dated 11-7-2011. The prosecution relied on these
findings to corroborate the presence of the appellants at the crime
scene.
123. Interestingly, PW 24 K.K. Dwivedi in his chief examination has
stated that Letter No. AC Branch/E/80/11 dated 20-6-2011 was sent by
Finger Print Branch, Indore to MIG Police Station for comparison of
chance fingerprints with the fingerprints of family members/suspects.
However, his cross-examination reveals no such letter was on the
record. The cross-examination also shows that he did not obtain
fingerprints of any other person (including family members of the
deceased) or article that was present at the place of the incident, for
the purpose of comparison - a point which has been urged by the
counsel on behalf of the appellants, laboriously. He also deposed that
there was neither a mark of the whole palm on the door, nor bloody
fingerprints on the door; and the other fingerprints available on the
door were unfit for lifting.
124. The appellants' counsel questioned the circumstances relating
to the fingerprint evidence, on grounds such as : (i) absence of any
elimination print;
(ii) irregularity in obtaining the appellant's fingerprints; (iii) non-
examination of Constable Dinesh (who collected the fingerprints of the
deceased for the process of elimination) by the prosecution; (iv) the
absence of covering letter, along with the fingerprint expert's report,
when produced in court; and (v) the fingerprints of the appellants were
not procured in accordance with law, as there was no compliance with
the Identification of Prisoners Act, 1920.
125. This Court would take up the last argument, at the outset. In
Sonvir V. State (NCT of Delhi)³7, it was held that the provisions of the
Identification of Prisoners Act, 1920, were not mandatory, but rather
directory, and that they only affirm the bona fides of the sample-taking
(of the fingerprints of an accused) and eliminate the possibility of
evidence fabrication. This Court however, made it clear that not
following or complying with the provisions of the Act, would not per se
vitiate the evidence, in a given case. This was again affirmed in Ashish
Jain V. Makrand Singh38.
126. In the present case, PW 24's deposition corroborates the lifting
of the fingerprints by Constable Dinesh in his presence. Therefore, the
non-examination of Constable Dinesh is not fatal to the prosecution's
case regarding fingerprints. As far as the integrity of the crime scene is
concerned, PW 21 deposed that though the door to the flat was open,
when he reached there, the police were standing outside and it was not
possible that the crime scene was contaminated. The IO (PW 31)
admitted that the crime scene was not sealed when the investigation
took place on the evening of 19-6-2011; however, he clarified that the
Forensic Department personnel who reached the site before him had
secured the place. Given this consistent evidence, this Court is of
opinion that the possibility of members of the public or unauthorised
persons, contaminating the crime scene, so soon after the incident was
reported, is remote.
127. Fingerprints collected at a crime scene from all personnel who
were at the scene and who might have inadvertently touched physical
evidence, are known as "elimination prints". In the present case,
elimination prints of the deceased were obtained on 20-6-2021; they
were part of the record. The record would show that PW 3, PW 5, PW 9
were present at the crime scene, but admittedly their fingerprints were
not obtained. It appears from the testimony of PW 9 that initially, the
witnesses were asked to be outside, but later, asked to join the
proceedings, to witness the seizures made. All the three witnesses,
consistently deposed regarding fingerprint experts' visit to the site, the
use of powder on the surfaces and lifting of fingerprints. PW 5, in the
cross-examination said that his fingerprint was not obtained. During
the hearing, the counsel for the appellants had repeatedly emphasised
that elimination prints were not taken from others present at the crime
scene; they also highlighted that fingerprints were not lifted from the
knives, pistol and ornaments seized from the accused.
128. In the opinion of this Court, nothing material turns on this
aspect. In a recent judgment-which the appellants relied on-i.e. Hari
Om
V. State of U.P. 23 this Court acquitted the accused, on the ground
that the fingerprint expert's opinion, even if accepted, would could not
have been the sole basis of conviction. What is important is whether
the crime scene was secured, and whether the lifting of prints was
witnessed. On both counts, the prosecution evidence is credible and
worthy of acceptance. These are also corroborated by the testimony of
PW 21, the Senior Scientific Officer, and the crime scene report dated
20-6-2021 (Ext. P-77) tendered by him.
129. The other aspect, relating to fingerprint evidence is that the
fingerprint report (Ext. P-84) was prepared on 11-7-2011. Ext. P-85 to
Ext. P-92 are photographs of the fingerprints lifted (these were
annexed to the fingerprint report, Ext. P-84). The fingerprint report was
enclosed with a letter (Ext. P-93). Given that the expert deposed to
lifting the prints, which were corroborated by the three witnesses (PW
3, PW 5 and PW 9) apart from the IO, the credibility of this
circumstance i.e. the lifting of the prints from the crime scene, their
match with the sample prints of the accused, and the expert's
testimony stand proved.
130. The appellant's arguments questioning the credibility of this
part, on the ground of delay in the report, the prints being chance
prints, lack of elimination prints, or the crime scene not being shown to
have been secured, etc. are insubstantial and are rejected.
IX. Circumstances relating to injuries on the deceased
131. The post-mortem report (Ext. P-44) indicates the extent of
injuries on the bodies of the deceased. Megha (aged 46) had a firearm
injury on the forehead and 4 deep stab wounds (abdomen, shoulder
and chest). Rohini (aged 76) had stab wounds across her body-
ranging from her fingers and hands, arms, and numerous injuries on
her abdomen and chest which had pierced her vital organs. Similarly,
Ashlesha (aged 22) received numerous stab injuries across her body -
including, her fingers, hands and forearms, hip, neck, abdomen and
chest which pierced her vital organs, back, and many superficial stab
wounds on her thighs.
132. The expert opinion of PW 15 Dr Thakur (the doctor who
conducted the post-mortem) was that the cause of death of Megha, was
shock caused by firearm injuries and haemorrhage. Rohini and
Ashlesha's death was due to shock and haemorrhage from their
numerous stab injuries. All three deaths were homicidal in nature. This
witness confirmed-both in his opinion and his testimony that all
injuries on the three deceased, except the gunshot injury (No. 1-on
the body of Megha) could have been caused by the two knives, seized
from the possession of Rahul and Manoj, respectively (Articles A and B,
forwarded to him for opinion under query Ext. P-47).
X. The ballistic report
A. The recovery of bullets from the crime scene and the deceased
Megha
133. Three cartridges (one live, and two shells) were seized by the
IO (PW 31) on 19-6-2011 from the crime scene. He prepared the site
map (Ext. P-25 and Ext. P-26) and recovery memo (Ext. P-27)
witnessed by PW 5 (landlord Vishal Pandey) and PW 9 (one Mahesh
Parmar, neighbour of informant Vishal Pandey). The IO deposed to
preparing the site map witnessed by PW 5 and to seizing one empty,
spent cartridge (lying on the floor near the body of Ashlesha), one
empty, spent cartridge from near bed, and one unused, live cartridge
from near the body (head) of Rohini. He also deposed that all the
cartridges had the inscription "KF 7.65" on them. PW 5 deposed that
the spot map was prepared in front of him and similarly deposed as to
the location of two cartridges - found under the bed and near Rohini's
body. However, the appellants did not cross-examine PW 5 about the
number of bullets seized i.e. on the third bullet. PW 9 also deposed on
similar lines.
134. PW 15 (doctor conducting the post-mortem examination)
deposed that on 20-6-2011, PW 33 S.S Kujur brought the dead body of
Megha Deshpande with a cover letter at 11.00 a.m.; and the post-
mortem began at around 11.45 a.m. Post-mortem was conducted along
with Dr Prashant Rajput and Dr N. Fadse (both were not examined). On
post-mortem of deceased Megha's body, a bullet was recovered. The
extraction of bullet is described as Wound 1 and the bullet was
recovered from anterior of cranium. PW 15 deposed that all the articles
were sealed, labelled and handed over to PW 33. The post-mortem
report (Ext. P-44) was prepared and taken from M.Y. Hospital to the
police station by PW 33, and a seizure memo (Ext. P-127) was prepared
by PW 34 Mahesh Prasad Yadav. The seizure report was witnessed by
Head Constable Shambhunath and Constable Ramjan, both of whom
were not examined. PW 33's deposition corroborated the facts relating
to him and his involvement.
135. Further, PW 15 in his cross-examination stated that the
weapon was shot in contact with the body and that he could not state
which weapon caused injuries to Megha. In cross-examination, PW 33
admitted that no specimen seal was obtained by him from the doctor
and no receipt was given to the doctor upon receiving the said articles.
Further, he stated that on 19-6-2011 he took the bodies to the hospital
by police vehicle after 6.00 p.m. He deposed to going home after
locking the mortuary (as it was night-time) and leaving the keys in the
hospital. PW 34 Mahesh Prasad Yadav deposed about preparing of
seizure memo (Ext. P-127) on 20-6-2011 upon presentation of the
articles by PW 33; and in cross-examination he admitted to not sending
a copy of seizure memo to the hospital, not filling Column 10 regarding
description of the seized items, the sample seal not being marked, and
that he did not mark the number of articles on the items mentioned in
the seizure memo. He further deposed that he did not open the packets
to see what was inside and also did not receive the post-mortem report
himself, but only made a roznamcha entry regarding seizure of items.
136. The joint reading of the testimonies of PW 15, PW 33 and PW
34 establishes that a bullet was extracted by the doctor (PW 15), and a
seizure memo was prepared in connection; the articles seized were
then sealed (although no mark was placed on the seal).
B. Recovery of bullet from Rahul and facts relating to it
137. Parallel to the recovery of the cartridges from the crime scene,
the prosecution story was that the accused Rahul suffered a bullet
injury during the incident. The prosecution alleged that Rahul went to
Annapurna Police Station and reported a false case of shooting. As to
this, PW 30 R.S. Makwana, (ASI Annapurna PS) deposed that on 19-6-
2011 he saw Rahul alias Govind coming to the police station in an
autorickshaw alleging that someone shot him in the foot and that he
was going to District Hospital for treatment. He gave the information to
PW 29 Gauri Shankar Chadar. PW 30 along with Constable Dinesh (who
was not examined) went to District Hospital. A dehati nalisi was
prepared (Ext. P-103). Later PW 30 went back to the police station to
register the FIR (Ext. P-107). PW 26 Dr Mukesh Bachawat (Medical
Officer in District Hospital) examined Rahul at around 22 : 40 hrs, and
prepared medical report (Ext. P-97), before referring Rahul to M.Y.
Hospital. Constable Dinesh accompanied Rahul to M.Y. Hospital for his
treatment. During the early hours of 20-6-2011, PW 32 Dr Nilesh Guru
examined Rahul and removed the bullet from his right foot. It was
deposited in the MLC section of the hospital (Ext. P-113). PW 30 stated
that he took the sealed packet from M.Y. Hospital on 23-6-2011 which
contained the bullet extracted from Rahul alias Govind's foot. Shivraj
Singh Raghuwanshi (not examined) prepared the seizure memo which
was exhibited as Ext. P-108 (Article Z-7) and PW 22 witnessed it. In
the cross-examination, PW 30 was questioned about the condition of
the bullet, whether it had traces of blood, etc.
138. The appellants argued that the prosecution failed to establish
that the bullet in fact was extracted from Rahul's right foot and it was
the one sent to the ballistic expert. The case made out was that the boy
examined by PW 26 and PW 32 was not Rahul at all. However, on that
score, there cannot be any doubt because PW 29 G.S. Chadar, who
recorded the dehati nalisi identified Rahul in the court as Govind, who
had reported that he was shot on the foot by an unknown person and
reported the matter to PS Annapurna. Furthermore, the signatures of
the complainant on the dehati nalisi (Ext. P-103) are identical to the
signatures of the appellant Rahul in his statement under Section 313
CrPC. The doubt sought to be raised with respect to the manner of
seizure of bullet in this Court's opinion, is not merited.
139. The identification of Rahul by PW 29, the deposition of PW 30
and PW 31 (IO) show that the doctor who extracted the bullet initially
kept it in safe custody with the hospital itself in the MLC section, which
was later retrieved by PW 30 on 23-6-2011 and the seizure made on
the same day in MIG Police Station. PW 22 Bharat Singh Thakur was in
fact a witness to the seizure memo (Ext. P-78, seized as Ext. P-108 by
PS MIG Police Station). Thus, an overall reading of the testimonies and
articles seized, in the opinion of the Court, lends
credence to the fact that Rahul suffered a bullet injury on 19-6-2011,
and proves the circumstances surrounding it, as presented by the
prosecution.
140. The ballistics report (Ext. P-52) was prepared by PW 16 Bheem
Bahadur, Head Constable at DRP Line, Indore. It described the nature
of the firearm seized, and cartridges recovered. The examination report
prepared by the State Forensic Science Laboratory (Ext. 120) stated
that on chemical examination of blood found on a piece of bandage
(swab of gunshot wound of deceased), it was not found positive for
nitrate, copper or lead. However, the report stated that two bullets were
compatible to the certified bullet of 7.65 mm calibre cartridge, and
bullet TB-A1 were found similar. Three pieces of skin, found copper
positive. Importantly, according to the report, two bullets (EB2 and
EB1) recovered from the body of Megha, the deceased, and Rahul's
right foot respectively, were fired from pistol Ext. A-1. The report also
stated that the bullet fired at the right shoe (seized on 22-6-2011
under seizure memo Ext. P-75, which was proved by PW 20) was
caused by a copper-jacketed bullet. Ext. P-120, which was exhibited by
the IO (PW 31), also listed inter alia, several articles such as Article A-5
(containing two fired empty shells of 7.65 mm calibre cartridge which
were marked as EC-I & EC-2); Article A-6 (containing live 7.65 mm
calibre pistol cartridge which was marked as LR-1); Article A-10
(containing bloodstained Vicks bottle); Article B-5 (containing three
small pieces of skin jointly marked SK-I); Article B-6 (containing one
piece of bandage cloth with substance thereon); Article F-1 (a country-
made pistol A-1); Article F-6, (containing one right leg shoe) and
Article F-7 (a bullet marked as EB-1).
141. The ballistics report, dated 14-7-2011, stated that PW 16 Bhim
Bahadur, ballistics expert test fired from the pistol received from the
MIG Police in a sealed packet. The ballistic report stated inter alia, that
"These are empty shells of used cartridge of 7.65 mm calibre
pistol and on whose head stamp "KF" is marked. They have mark of
firing pin/breach face. On comparison through microscope both are
found alike as well as like test fire cartridge TC-A1. The photo-
micrograph has been taken for alike situation of Ext. EC1 & TC-A1
wherein the points of similarity have been marked."
PW 16 who prepared the report, stated in his deposition that he:
"
had checked operating firing pin, magazine catch and these
were found in serviceable condition. fire opened by, this country-
made pistol could cause loss of life for the people".
142. The IO deposed that all seized articles were sent for chemical
and ballistic examination on 13-7-2011 by letter Ext. P-115, to which
the acknowledgment receipt was Exts. P-116 to P-118. The ballistic
expert PW 16 was not cross-examined. There is nothing on record that
discredits the ballistics examination or conclusions drawn by the expert
PW 16, and this circumstance is therefore, proved.
XI. DNA evidence and the DNA expert's report
143. A sample of blood found on the floor of the incident where the
body of deceased Megha was lying, was collected on a cotton swab,
marked as A-1 and put in a paper envelope. Similarly, a sample of
blood found near deceased Rohini, was marked as A-2 and sample of
blood near deceased Ashlesha, was marked as A-3. A sample of plain
cotton was also placed in a paper envelope and marked as A-4, as per
seizure memo (Ext. P-27) prepared by the IO at the crime scene. The
seizure of these samples/articles (among others) from the crime scene
is corroborated by the testimony of PW 5 and PW 9 who are also
witnesses to Ext. P-27. PW 17 Satyanarayan Patel (crime scene
photographer) had photographed the crime scene (Ext. P-61 to Ext. P-
65). These photos show bloodstains as well as the position, and
direction of the bodies. The clothes (B-1, C-1, D-1), vaginal swabs (B-
2, C-2, D-2) and pubic hairs (B-3, C-3, D-3) were also taken from each
of the deceased - Megha, Rohini and Ashlesha, respectively.
144. The clothes from which DNA material was obtained from the
accused, were recovered pursuant to disclosure statements (Ext. P-28,
Ext. P-31, and Ext. P-34) made on 23-6-2011. Seizures of the relevant
clothing articles (Ext. P-29, Ext. P-32, and Ext. P-35) were drawn in the
presence of PW 7 Sandeep Narulkar and Prakash Ichke (who was not
examined by the prosecution), which as discussed at length earlier -
throws some doubt on the recoveries made on 23-6-2011. In addition
to their clothes, the prosecution submitted that DNA material was also
extracted from the knife seized from Manoj on 22-6-2011 (Ext. P-14),
and the iron knife from Rahul on 23-6-2011 (Ext. P-29).
145. The deposition of PW 35 Dr Pankaj Srivastava, Scientific Officer,
DNA Fingerprint Unit FSL, Sagar, read with the DNA report dated 10-8-
2011 (Ext. P-122) prepared by him, provide details of the DNA
analysis. This witness stated that the department received 19 exhibits
concerning this case on 14-7-2011, in a sealed condition, which as per
his cross, he examined on 18-7-2011. The expert's report reveals that
DNA was extracted through the Automated DNA Extraction System 12
GC and Organic extraction. 16 desired genetic markers were taken from
DNA to be tested by Amplification Multiple PCR Technique. Thus,
genotyping profile was obtained along with Automated DNA sequencer
of amplified DNA, AmfF/STR Identifier kit, AmpF/STR Y Filer kit. The
analysis of the results was done by gene mapping software v3.5. PW 35
clarified that "physical substance" mentioned in the report is meant to
be blood.
146. All of the articles obtained in connection to Megha (cotton swab
of blood near her body A-1, clothes B-1, vaginal smear slide B-2, bullet
seized from her body B-4) were compared and uniform female DNA
profile was found. Similarly, a uniform female DNA profile was found in
the case of articles in connection to Rohini (A-2, C-1, C-2) and
Ashlesha (A-3, D-1, D-3). These DNA profiles were then compared with
the DNA material extracted from the clothes of the three accused, and
the two knives recovered from Rahul and Manoj, which form a part of
the DNA report.
147. The conclusions of the DNA matches and consequent opinion of
PW 35 in the report, are summarised in the below table:
Victim
Articles of accused
Megha
A-1, B-1, B-2 and
Clothes (Ext. F-4) and knife (Ext. F-
B-4
5) recovered from Rahul
Clothes (Ext. H-2) belonging to
Neha
Bullet (Ext. B-4) recovered from
body of deceased
Ashlesha
A-3, D-1, D-2
Clothes (Ext. G-3) and knife (Ext. G
-1) recovered from Manoj
148. DNA material found on the bloodstained bedsheet seized from
the scene of the crime (Ext. A-9) indicated presence of mixed DNA
profile of the deceased i.e. DNA material of more than one individual.
There is no mention of DNA material on the articles matching Rohini's
DNA profile. As is evident from the above table, the DNA material which
the prosecution relies on, is that of the victims which according to the
prosecution, was found on articles recovered from the possession of the
accused. It is not a case of having found DNA material of the accused,
at the crime scene or on the bodies of the deceased. Hence, the
fingernail clippings (Exts. P-18, P-19 and P-20) taken from the accused
at the time of arrest, seem to have not been considered/used.
149. During the cross-examination what was put to PW 35, was
whether : (a) the time period between seizure/incident and
examination would have any bearing on the DNA analysis, (b) there
was a cut mark in Manoj's clothes (G-3), (c) the articles were in sealed
condition, (d) the clothes had to be kept in a particular condition, and if
blood could mix when clothes kept together - the answers to which are
satisfactory. However, the typographical error of mentioning ID 3074 as
ID 3078 raises concern and was pressed upon by the counsel for the
appellants.
150. Before this Court, the appellants have raised concerns
regarding the unexplained delay in sending the articles seized on 23-6-
2011 only 20 days later on 13-7-2011 (Ext. P-115) and the condition in
which they were preserved, the lack of statistical analysis, and that the
observation sheet on which PW 35 deposed to have made notings on,
was not placed on the record. Serologist reports prepared by Dr M.P.
Singh (Exts. P-123 and P-124) are also on the record which reveal that
blood was present on one bullet (B-4), but blood quantity was not
enough to run tests. This naturally raises a question on whether it was
possible to extract DNA, at all. The other articles mentioned in the
serologist's report were A-10 (Vicks bottle), F-2 (Rahul's left shoe), F-3
(Rahul's nails), F-6 (Rahul's right shoe), F-7 (bullet recovered from
Rahul's right foot), G-2 (Manoj's nails), G-4 (Manoj's shoes), H-1
(Neha's nails) and H-3 (Neha's sandals). However, the bloodstains were
too disintegrated or the quantity of blood on the articles, was not
sufficient to run classification tests.
151. During the hearing, an article published by the Central Forensic
Science Laboratory, Kolkata 39 was relied upon. The relevant extracts of
the article are reproduced below:
"Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is genetic material present in the
nuclei of cells of living organisms. An average human body is
composed of about 100 trillion of cells. DNA is present in the nucleus
of cell as double helix, supercoiled to form chromosomes along with
intercalated proteins. Twenty-three pairs of chromosomes present in
each nucleated cells and an individual inherits 23 chromosomes from
mother and 23 from father transmitted through the ova and sperm
respectively. At the time of each cell division, chromosomes replicate
and one set goes to each daughter cell. All information about internal
organisation, physical characteristics, and physiological functions of
the body is encoded in DNA molecules in a language (sequence) of
alphabets of four nucleotides or bases : Adenine (A), Guanine (G),
Thymine (T) and Cytosine (C) along with sugar phosphate backbone.
A human haploid cell contains 3 billion bases approx. All cells of the
body have exactly same DNA but it varies from individual to
individual in the sequence of nucleotides. Mitochondrial DNA
(mtDNA) found in large number of copies in the mitochondria is
circular, double stranded, 16,569 base pair in length and shows
maternal inheritance. It is particularly useful in the study of people
related through the maternal line. Also being in large number of
copies than nuclear DNA, it can be used in the analysis of degraded
samples. Similarly, the Y chromosome shows paternal inheritance
and is employed to trace the male lineage and resolve DNA from
males in sexual assault mixtures.
Only 0.1 % of DNA (about 3 million bases) differs from one person
to another. Forensic DNA Scientists analyse only few variable regions
to generate a DNA profile of an individual to compare with biological
clue materials or control samples.
*
*
*
DNA Profiling Methodology
DNA profile is generated from the body fluids, stains, and other
biological specimen recovered from evidence and the results are
compared with the results obtained from reference samples. Thus, a
link among victim(s) and/or suspect(s) with one another or with
crime scene can be established. DNA profiling is a complex process
of analyses of some highly variable regions of DNA. The variable
areas of DNA are termed genetic markers. The current genetic
markers of choice for forensic purposes are Short Tandem Repeats
(STRs). Analysis of a set of 15 STRs employing Automated DNA
Sequencer gives a DNA profile unique to an individual (except
monozygotic twin). Similarly, STRs present on Y chromosome (Y-
STR) can also be used in sexual assault cases or determining
paternal lineage. In cases of sexual assaults, Y-STRs are helpful in
detection of male
profile even in the presence of high level of female portion or in case of
azoo11permic or vasectomized" male. Cases in which DNA had
undergone environmental stress and biochemical degradation, min
ISTRs can be used for over routine STR because of shorter amplicon
size.
DNA profiling is a complicated process and each sequential step
involved in generating a profile can vary depending on the facilities
available in the laboratory. The analysis principles, however, remain
similar, which include:
1. isolation, purification & quantitation of DNA
2. amplification of selected genetic markers
3. visualising the fragments and genotyping
4. statistical analysis & interpretation.
In mtDNA analysis, variations in Hypervariable Region I & II (HVR
I & II) are detected by sequencing and comparing results with
control samples:
Statistical Analysis
Atypical DNA case involves comparison of evidence samples, such
as semen from a rape, and known or reference samples, such as a
blood sample from a suspect. Generally, there are three possible
outcomes of profile comparison:
(1) Match : If the DNA profiles obtained from the two samples
are indistinguishable, they are said to have matched.
(2) Exclusion : If the comparison of profiles shows differences,
it can only be explained by the two samples originating from
different sources.
(3) Inconclusive : The data does not support a conclusion of the
three possible outcomes, only the "match" between samples needs
to be supported by statistical calculation. Statistics attempt to
provide meaning to the match. The match statistics are usually
provided as an estimate of the Random Match Probability (RMP) or in
other words, the frequency of the particular DNA profile in a
population.
In case of paternity/maternity testing, exclusion at more than two
loci is considered exclusion. An allowance of 1 or 2 loci possible
mutations should be taken into consideration while reporting a
match. Paternity or Maternity indices and likelihood ratios are
calculated further to support the match.
Collection and Preservation of Evidence
If DNA evidence is not properly documented, collected, packaged,
and preserved, it will not meet the legal and scientific requirements
for admissibility in a court of law. Because extremely small samples
of DNA can be used as evidence, greater attention to contamination
issues is necessary while locating, collecting, and preserving. DNA
evidence can be contaminated when DNA from another source gets
mixed with DNA
relevant to the case. This can happen when someone sneezes or coughs
over the evidence or touches his/her mouth, nose, or other part of the
face and then touches area that may contain the DNA to be tested. The
exhibits having biological specimen, which can establish link among
victim(s), suspect(s), scene of crime for solving the case should be
identified, preserved, packed and sent for DNA profiling."
152. In an earlier judgment, R V. Dohoney & Adams40 the UK Court
of Appeal laid down the following guidelines concerning the procedure
for introducing DNA evidence in trials : (1) the scientist should adduce
the evidence of the DNA comparisons together with his calculations of
the random occurrence ratio; (2) whenever such evidence is to be
adduced, the Crown (prosecution) should serve upon the defence
details as to how the calculations have been carried out, which are
sufficient for the defence to scrutinise the basis of the calculations; (3)
the Forensic Science Service should make available to a defence expert,
if requested, the databases upon which the calculations have been
based.
153. The Law Commission of India in its Report4 observed as
follows:
"DNA evidence involves comparison between genetic material
thought to come from the person whose identity is in issue and a
sample of genetic material from a known person. If the samples do
not "match", then this will prove a lack of identity between the
known person and the person from whom the unknown sample
originated. If the samples match, that does not mean the identity is
conclusively proved. Rather, an expert will be able to derive from a
database of DNA samples, an approximate number reflecting how
often a similar DNA "profile" or "fingerprint" is found. It may be, for
example, that the relevant profile is found in 1 person in every
1,00,000 : This is described as the "random occurrence
ratio" (Phipson 1999, 15th Edn., Para 14.32).
Thus, DNA may be more useful for purposes of investigation but
not for raising any presumption of identity in a court of law."
(emphasis in original)
154. In Dharam Deo Yadav V. State of U.P. 42 this Court discussed
the reliability of DNA evidence in a criminal trial, and held as follows
:
"36. The DNA stands for deoxyribonucleic acid, which is the
biological blueprint of every life. DNA is made up of a double
stranded structure consisting of a deoxyribose sugar and phosphate
backbone, cross-linked with two types of nucleic acids referred to as
adenine and guanine, purines and thymine and cytosine pyrimidines.
DNA usually can be obtained from any biological material such as
blood, semen, saliva, hair, skin, bones, etc. The question as to
whether DNA tests are virtually infallible
may be a moot question, but the fact remains that such test has come
to stay and is being used extensively in the investigation of crimes and
the court often accepts the views of the experts, especially when cases
rest on circumstantial evidence. More than half a century, samples of
human DNA began to be used in the criminal justice system. Of course,
debate lingers over the safeguards that should be required in testing
samples and in presenting the evidence in court. DNA profile, however,
is consistently held to be valid and reliable, but of course, it depends on
the quality control and quality assurance procedures in the laboratory."
155. The US Supreme Court in District Attorney's Office for the Third
Judicial District V. Osborne43 dealt with a post-conviction claim to
access evidence, at the behest of the convict, who wished to prove his
innocence, through new DNA techniques. It was observed, in the
"Modern DNA testing can provide powerful new evidence unlike
anything known before. Since its first use in criminal investigations
in the mid-1980s, there have been several major advances in DNA
technology, culminating in STR technology. It is now often possible
to determine whether a biological tissue matches a suspect with near
certainty. While of course many criminal trials proceed without any
forensic and scientific testing at all, there is no technology
comparable to DNA testing for matching tissues when such evidence
is at issue. DNA testing has exonerated wrongly convicted people,
and has confirmed the convictions of many others."
156. Several decisions of this Court - Pantangi Balarama Venkata
Ganesh V. State of A.P.44, Santosh Kumar Singh V. State45 State of
T.N. V. John David46 Krishan Kumar Malik V. State of Haryana4
Surendra Koli V. State of U.P.48 Sandeep V. State of U.P.4 Rajkumar V.
State of M.P. 50 and Mukesh V. State (NCT of Delhi)51 have dealt with
the increasing importance of DNA evidence. This Court has also
emphasised the need for assuring quality control, about the samples,
as well as the technique for testing in Anil V. State of Maharashtra52
"18. Deoxyribonucleic acid, or DNA, is a molecule that encodes
the genetic information in all living organisms. DNA genotype can be
obtained from any biological material such as bone, blood, semen,
saliva, hair, skin,
etc. Now, for several years, DNA profile has also shown a tremendous
impact on forensic investigation. Generally, when DNA profile of a
sample found at the scene of crime matches with DNA profile of the
suspect, it can generally be concluded that both samples have the
same biological origin. DNA profile is valid and reliable, but variance in
a particular result depends on the quality control and quality procedure
in the laboratory."
157. This Court, in one of its recent decisions, Pattu Rajan V. State
of T.N.53 53 considered the value and weight to be attached to a DNA
"52. Like all other opinion evidence, the probative value accorded
to DNA evidence also varies from case to case, depending on facts
and circumstances and the weight accorded to other evidence on
record, whether contrary or corroborative. This is all the more
important to remember, given that even though the accuracy of DNA
evidence may be increasing with the advancement of science and
technology with every passing day, thereby making it more and
more reliable, we have not yet reached a juncture where it may be
said to be infallible. Thus, it cannot be said that the absence of DNA
evidence would lead to an adverse inference against a party,
especially in the presence of other cogent and reliable evidence on
record in favour of such party."
158. This Court, therefore, has relied on DNA reports, in the past,
where the guilt of an accused was sought to be established. Notably,
the reliance, was to corroborate. This Court highlighted the need to
ensure quality in the testing and eliminate the possibility of
contamination of evidence; it also held that being an opinion, the
probative value of such evidence has to vary from case to case.
159. In the present case, what is apparent, is that PW 35 has
virtually echoed the DNA analysis in his chief examination, and not
chosen to elaborate on the random occurrence ratio i.e. the probability
of the accused's samples matching with those allegedly found at the
crime scene. This Court has already discussed whether the recoveries of
23-6-2011 pursuant to disclosures made that day can be accepted and
held that they are suspect and need to be discarded. This leaves the
report, to the extent it says that samples lifted from recoveries made at
the crime scene matched with what was seized on 22-6-2011 (knives,
and other articles), to be inconclusive.
160. It is noteworthy that seizure Memo Ext. 27, in terms of which
Article A-9 (ID 3063) is said to have been seized, does not record that
as a matter of fact, a bedsheet was seized. If one keeps in mind that
source H2 (ID 3078) in relation to Neha was seized on 23-4-2011, and
from an open area, the likelihood of its contamination-even if
arguendo the genuineness of its recovery might have been accepted-
carried some degree of probability. For these reasons, it is held that the
DNA report in the present case cannot have a clinching, or high degree
of probative value.
XII. Evidence relating to footprints
161. The inspection report (Ext. P-77) prepared by PW 21 Dr Sudhir
Sharma described the scene of the crime. It mentioned that three types
of blooded partial shoeprints were found in the following areas : (a)
near the table at the crime scene; (b) in the pool of blood near the
body of Ashlesha; and (c) on the floor near the almirahs.
162. PW 21 did not, in his cross-examination remember the number
of partial shoeprints found at the incident (which he later says were at
2-3 places), but states that there were three kinds of prints. He also
mentioned that no dust was present, and therefore barefoot prints were
not possible. In his chief examination, PW 21 mentioned that at his
instruction, PW 17 (crime scene photographer) took scaled photographs
of the blood-smeared partial shoeprints found at the place of the
incident (which are Ext. P-66 to Ext. P-74). This is not mentioned in the
chief examination of PW 17; who only later in his cross, states that he
had taken 8x12 scaled photos of the footprints and locations with
bloodstains, which were Ext. P-66 to Ext. P-74.
1 As already elaborated earlier, Manoj's shoes were seized at his
behest (Ext. P-31, Ext. P-32) and sandals from Neha based on her
disclosure (Ext. P-34, Ext. P-35) on 23-6-2011. Rahul's right shoe was
seized by Annapurna PS on 22-6-2011 which is corroborated by the
testimony of PW 20 Harbhajan Singh (independent witness), who
stated that Abhay Tiwari (not examined) had spotted the bloodstained
shoe in his garden and reported it to the police, and that both of them
were witnesses to the seizure memo (Ext. P-75). The left shoe was
seized (Ext. P-21) pursuant to disclosure made by Rahul to the IO.
164. In furtherance of Ext. P-115 letter dated 13-7-2011 sent by the
IO to the State Forensic Laboratory, examination report of shoeprints
dated 13-9-2011 was prepared. This report stated that, the exhibits
were received by the Ballistics Branch on 2-8-2011 in sealed condition.
For comparative examination, sample prints of soles of shoes of Exts. F-
2, F-6, and G-4 and sandals of Ext. H-3 were made (photographs 10,
11, 12, 13 and 14). The shoeprints found were merely mentioned
together - it is unclear as to which photograph (#10, 11, etc.) is the
sample of which shoe (F-2, F-5, etc.).
165. This Court is of the opinion that much weight cannot be
attached to the footprint evidence in this case. The report explicitly
notes that shoeprints are incomplete and unclear, and that specific and
clear opinion could not be given. Yet, the expert proceeded to give his
opinion about the matching of the prints. In State of Bihar V. Kapil
Singh 54 this Court had held that evidence of an expert relating to
presence of a footprint, at the best is of a weak nature. This view was
also shared by Mohd. Aman V. State of Rajasthan11 and Balbir Singh V.
State of Punjab The prosecution, in the opinion of this Court, has not
proved this circumstance.
Principles applicable to appreciation of evidence in cases
involving circumstantial evidence
166. In one of its earlier decisions this Court had in Hanumant V.
State of M.P.
55
indicated that the correct approach of courts trying
criminal cases involving circumstantial evidence should be that the
circumstances alleged, be fully established; all the facts so established
should be consistent only with hypothesis of the guilt of the accused;
circumstances should be conclusive and of such tendency that they
should be such as to exclude every hypothesis but the one proposed to
be proved. This view was followed later in Tufail V. State of U.P. and
56
Ram Gopal V. State of Maharashtra 57. All these and other decisions
were revisited in the three-Judge Bench decision in Sharad Birdhichand
Sarda V. State of Maharashtra ² and the Court enunciated a set of
principles that every court trying criminal cases entirely based on
circumstantial evidence had to follow.
167. The conclusions recorded by this Court in Sharad24 were listed
in para 152 (which were characterised in para 153 as "five golden
"153.
(1) the circumstances from which the conclusion of guilt
is to be drawn should be fully established.
It
may be noted here that this Court indicated that the circumstances concerned
"must or should" and not "may be" established. There is not only a grammatical but
a legal distinction between "may be proved" and "must be or should be proved" as
was held by this Court in Shivaji Sahabrao Bobade V. State of Maharashtra 58
`19.
Certainly, it is a primary principle that the accused must be
and not merely may be guilty before a court can convict and the
mental distance between "may be" and "must be" is long and
divides vague conjectures from sure conclusions."
(2) The facts so established should be consistent only with the
hypothesis of the guilt of the accused, that is to say, they should not
be explainable on any other hypothesis except that the accused is
guilty,
(3) the circumstances should be of a conclusive nature and
tendency.
(4) they should exclude every possible hypothesis except the one
to be proved, and
(5) there must be a chain of evidence so complete as not to leave
any reasonable ground for the conclusion consistent with the
innocence of the accused and must show that in all human
probability the act must have been done by the accused.
154. These five golden principles, if we may say so, constitute the
panchsheel of the proof of a case based on circumstantial evidence."
(emphasis in original)
168. These principles have stood the test of time, and the evidence
in all criminal cases, has been evaluated in their light, throughout the
country. In light of these binding principles this Court would now
examine whether the circumstances supported by evidence i.e. those
accepted by this Court in the previous part of the judgment, were of
such conclusion as to stand the test of the five golden principles
enunciated in Sarda²4.
Summation of proof of circumstances
169. The prosecution relied upon several circumstances which were
accepted concurrently by the courts below. These were the depositions
of PW 10, the chance witness, who claimed to have witnessed all three
accused fleeing the spot around 5.45 or 6.00 p.m. on the day of the
incident; the recovery of articles from the crime scene (fired cartridge,
live bullet, sunglasses, black beads, etc.) and lifting of the fingerprints
(testified by PW 24 and corroborated by witnesses PW 5 and PW 9);
and seizure of stolen articles pursuant to disclosure by the accused. PW
1 who recorded his statement a day after the incident (on 21-6-2011),
specifically reported the loss of jewellery items such as four pairs of
bangles, mangalsutra, ATM cards, etc. These were later recovered at
the direction of the accused, which the prosecution claimed to be a
breakthrough.
170. It was found by the courts below that Neha was arrested in the
morning of 22-6-2011 after she was found suspiciously loitering by PW
28. The arrest occurred after she was searched and later questioned.
The arrest was witnessed PW 3 and PW 6 who also deposed to
witnessing the police recording Neha's disclosure statement. Recoveries
of valuables and articles, such as two pairs of golden bangles, part of a
broken mangalsutra, other valuables and an ATM card, which belonged
to Megha were from her house. Neha's disclosure statement about the
involvement of other accused (Rahul and Manoj) led to their arrest and
disclosure statements on the same day - all of which was witnessed by
PW 3 and PW 6. Again, gold jewellery items were recovered from
Rahul's premises as also a country-made pistol, and subsequently,
a
knife. In addition, a photograph with him wearing sunglasses was
seized from his house. Manoj was likewise arrested and his disclosure
statement led to the recovery of a knife, a pair of golden bangles, part
of a broken mangalsutra, etc. Later during the same day on 22-6-2011,
a right shoe was recovered by another police station (Annapurna PS). It
was seized; which was witnessed by PW 20. At that time, its connection
with the murders was unknown.
171. The prosecution also relied on a disclosure statement said to
have been recorded on 23-6-2011 leading to the recovery of clothes at
the behest of Neha, Rahul and Manoj from various open sites. Further,
at Neha's behest a Scooty with a service book was recovered and
seized, and at Manoj's behest,
a motorcycle reportedly stolen was found. These recoveries were
witnessed by PW 7 an independent witness. The prosecution relied
upon two sets of TIP proceedings, which sought to identify on the one
hand, Manoj and Rahul, and on the other, Neha. It also relied upon the
TIP proceedings in which PW 1 identified the stolen articles which he
had reported loss of, on 21-6-2011 itself. The prosecution had relied
upon other evidence such as the match of fingerprints, in terms of the
expert's report (Ext. P-84, by PW 24), upon the reports of the ballistic
expert (PW 16), and of the DNA expert (PW 35). It also sought to rely
upon the report of another expert who spoke about the probability of
shoeprint match.
172. In the preceding discussion of the evidence in the earlier part
of this judgment, this Court has held that though the prosecution
version of how Neha was arrested had to be disbelieved, it did not taint
her subsequent disclosure, which led to the seizure and recovery of
stolen articles from her premises - four stolen pieces of jewellery, and
an ATM card which belonged to Megha, the deceased (proved by PW 27,
bank official). The previous discussion of the evidence relating to the
other accused led this Court to infer that the prosecution was able to
prove the recovery of articles seized on 22-6-2011 from the premises of
Rahul and Manoj i.e. golden bangles, parts of a broken mangalsutra,
each from the houses of the accused, a country-made pistol and a
knife, from Rahul's house at his behest. This Court also concluded that
the TIP proceedings conducted in respect of the stolen articles was
validly proved by the prosecution.
173. The report of the ballistic expert PW 16, has been held to have
established that the seized bullets (from the crime scene), matched
with the test fired bullet from the pistol seized from Rahul's house at
his behest. The recovery of a right shoe with a bullet hole on 22-6-
2011, likewise was proved by the prosecution. The other circumstance
which the prosecution relied upon in this context, pointing to Rahul's
involvement was his treatment by PW 32. Rahul had late in the evening
of 19-6-2011, reported to PS Annapurna, that he was shot on the right
foot, by some unknown assailants which was recorded by PW 29, who
also identified him in the court. PW 29 further deposed that Rahul first
went to District Hospital and was treated by PW 26, who then referred
him to M.Y. Hospital. Later in the early hours of 20-6-2011 Rahul was
operated upon by PW 32 who extracted the bullet, sealed it and kept it
with the MLC cell. This bullet was seized by the police and sent to the
ballistic expert (PW 24) who in his report supported the prosecution's
version that the bullet was fired from the same weapon which had
discharged the bullet that was extracted from the deceased Megha's
body.
174. This Court has disbelieved the prosecution allegation with
respect to the circumstances surrounding Neha's arrest, principally
because of the evidence of DW 1. It is quite clear that DW 1 Deepika
Shinde was involved to an extent during the initial stages of the
investigation and according to the police records, was responsible for
the breakthrough which led among others, to her out-of-turn
promotion, swiftly. This Court has also disbelieved the story of the
prosecution with respect to the recoveries alleged to have been made
on
23-6-2011, mainly on the ground that when according to the official
version the accused were nabbed and had made the disclosure
statements the previous day, nothing prevented the police from
recording the entirety of it and proceeding to recover articles which
were supposedly hidden in open spaces. Further, the Court has not
accepted the prosecution's story with respect to the chance witnesses,
PW 10 and his identification of the accused in TIP proceedings.
175. During the hearing, the appellants' counsel had urged that the
findings of the trial court are unsustainable, because they overlooked
several lacunae which cumulatively tended to undermine the
prosecution's case. The omission to examine certain witnesses (such as
PW 1's driver, Nandakumar; Abhay Tiwari, who along with PW 20 found
the right shoe with a bullet hole; Amit Soni, who went to the TIP of
articles, with some jewellery items; Prakash Ichke, who witnessed the
recoveries and seizures on 23-6-2011, Constable Dinesh, who
accompanied Rahul to M.Y. Hospital, etc.). It was also emphasised that
the silence of certain witnesses (such as PW 4, in regard to whether she
witnessed the arrest, and search of Neha; of PW 19, who was silent
about receiving a report from PW 28 regarding Neha's suspicious
activities in the morning of 22-6-2011; silence by prosecution
witnesses about DW 1's role), too, cast grave doubts about the
prosecution version. Furthermore, it was contended that the seizure,
sealing, transmission of articles found at the crime scene and recovered
from the accused's premises, as well as open areas, as well as their
chain of custody was not proved.
176. This Court has previously discussed the probative value of the
evidence relied on by the prosecution, and rejected the way in which
Neha was apprehended, the recoveries made on 23-6-2011, the TIP of
the accused, the deposition of PW 10 and of PW 8, and the DNA and
shoeprint analysis. The first question is whether having regard to the
rejection of some of the prosecution evidence, the case against the
accused, as a whole, stands disproved. This aspect has been considered
in earlier decisions of this Court where defects in investigation, or
lapses in the recollection during testimonies of witnesses, were
involved.
177. In State of U.P. V. Anil Singh59, , this Court observed as follows :
"17. It is also our experience that invariably the witnesses add
embroidery to prosecution story, perhaps for the fear of being
disbelieved. But that is no ground to throw the case overboard, if
true, in the main. If there is a ring of truth in the main, the case
should not be rejected. It is the duty of the court to cull out the
nuggets of truth from the evidence unless there is reason to believe
that the inconsistencies or falsehood are so glaring as utterly to
destroy confidence in the witnesses. It is necessary to remember
that a Judge does not preside over a criminal trial merely to see that
no innocent man is punished. A Judge also presides to see that a
guilty man does not escape. One is as important as the other. Both
are public duties which the Judge has to perform."
589, para 55)
"55.
the defect in the investigation by itself cannot be a ground
for acquittal. If primacy is given to such designed or negligent
investigations or to the omissions or lapses by perfunctory
investigation, the faith and confidence of the people in the criminal
justice administration would be eroded. Where there has been
negligence on the part of the investigating agency or omissions, etc.
which resulted in defective investigation, there is a legal obligation
on the part of the court to examine the prosecution evidence dehors
such lapses, carefully, to find out whether the said evidence is
reliable or not and to what extent it is reliable and as to whether
such lapses affected the object of finding out the truth."
179. A similar approach was adopted in Surajit Sarkar V. State of
W.B.
61 and Shanker V. State of M.P. 62 In Harijana Thirupala V. Public
476, para 11)
"11.
The case of the prosecution must be judged as a whole
having regard to the totality of the evidence. In appreciating the
evidence, the approach of the court must be integrated not
truncated or isolated. In other words, the impact of evidence in
totality on the prosecution case or innocence of the accused has to
be kept in mind in coming to the conclusion as to the guilt or
otherwise of the accused. In reaching a conclusion about the guilt of
the accused, the court has to appreciate, analyse and assess the
evidence placed before it by the yardstick of probabilities, its
intrinsic value and the animus of witnesses."
180. This Court has further emphasised that if discrepancies in the
depositions are minor, or that witnesses contradict themselves during
their testimonies (as opposed to their previous police statements) what
is important is the nature of contradictions. In Rammi V. State of
"24.
courts should bear in mind that it is only when
discrepancies in the evidence of a witness are so incompatible with
the credibility of his version that the court is justified in jettisoning
his evidence. But too serious a view to be adopted on mere
variations falling in the narration of an incident (either as between
the evidence of two witnesses or as between two statements of the
same witness) is an unrealistic approach for judicial scrutiny."
246, para 13)
"13.
The court while appreciating the evidence must not attach
undue importance to minor discrepancies. The discrepancies which
do not shake the basic version of the prosecution case may be
discarded."
182. In a similar vein, it was observed, in Vinod Kumar V. State of
"24.
Only when discrepancies in the evidence of a witness are
so incompatible with the credibility of his version that it would be
justified in jettisoning his evidence."
183. The omission of some of the prosecution witnesses to mention
a particular fact, or corroborate something, which is deposed to by
other witnesses, therefore, does not ipso facto favour an accused. What
is important, however, is whether the omission to depose about a fact
is so fundamental that the prosecution version becomes shaky and
incredulous. In the present case, the omission to depose about certain
facts, by PW 4, or PW 19, or any other witness cannot inure to the
accused's benefit. Each of the facts they omitted, was supported by one
or more witnesses.
184. Likewise, the failure to examine certain persons, like Anil Soni,
Prakash Ichke, Abhay Tiwari, or Nandakumar, cannot inure to the
accused's benefit. Anil Soni was present during the TIP of seized
articles, when other similar articles brought by him, for comparison and
identification by PW 1. The latter witness was able to identify the
articles which had been seized from the accused; this was deposed to
by PW 12, whose testimony cannot be doubted. The failure to examine
Anil Soni therefore, was a lapse, but not a fatal one, as far as the TIP
itself went. Likewise, the failure to examine Prakash Ichke is of no
consequence, because the recoveries made on 23-6-2011 have not
been accepted. The omission to examine Nandakumar is also
inconsequential, given the sequence of reporting of the crime, and the
rapidity of the events which developed after it. No doubt, Abhay Tiwari
noticed the right shoe with a bullet hole, first; however, PW 20 was also
with him; he deposed to the fact of its discovery and seizure. Similarly,
the failure to examine Constable Dinesh is also not fatal, given the
testimony of PW 29 and PW 30.
185. In Shivaji Sahabrao Bobade V. State of Maharashtra 58 this
Court held that even where a case hangs on the evidence of one
eyewitness, it may be enough to sustain the conviction given sterling
testimony of a competent, honest man although as a rule of prudence
19)
"19.
It is a platitude to say that witnesses have to be weighed
and not counted since quality matters more than quantity in human
affairs."
186. Kartik Malhar V. State of Bihar67 referred to previous decisions,
"7. On a conspectus of these decisions, it clearly comes out that
there has been no departure from the principles laid down in
Vadivelu Thevar case68 and, therefore, conviction can be recorded on
the basis of the statement of a single eyewitness provided his
credibility is not shaken by any adverse circumstance appearing on
the record against him and the court, at the same time, is convinced
that he is a truthful witness."
187. Therefore, unless it is shown that the omission to examine a
witness, who had previously participated during the investigation and
whose statement was recorded by the police, undermines the
prosecution case, or impacts on it significantly, the foundation of the
fact or facts which are sought to be proved, remains unshaken as long
as that fact is deposed to or spoken about by other witnesses, whose
testimonies are to be seen in their own terms. Therefore, the omission
to examine the individuals left out, but who the prosecution claimed,
had participated during the investigation, did not affect its case, as far
as the circumstances held to have been established by it, are
concerned. Having dealt with the contentions of the accused, and also
discussed circumstances that could be established (and what was not
established) this Court proceeds to summarise its findings.
188. As against Neha, this Court has held that the circumstances
proved are:
188.1. Firstly, recovery of articles including two golden bangles, a
broken mangalsutra, 3 guriyas, a gold pendant, an ATM card which
belonged to Megha on 22-6-2011. The loss of these articles was
reported by PW 1, on 21-6-2011 i.e. one day before Neha's arrest.
188.2. The second circumstance proved by the prosecution is the
TIP of these articles by PW 1 who was able to correctly identify them
(as also corroborated by PW 12 during the trial). Linked with this
circumstance is the deposition of PW 27, a Bank of India, Ujjain official
who deposed to issuing a letter to the SHO, (Ext. P-98), containing the
ATM card numbers. The ATM card (5264959108034023) which
belonged to Megha, recovered on 22-6-2011 pursuant to Neha's
disclosure statement, from her house, was issued by that bank.
188.3. The third circumstance proved by the prosecution against
Neha is her fingerprint. PW 24 K.K. Dwivedi, the fingerprint expert,
deposed to searching the crime scene for possibility of lifting
impressions of fingerprints. A set of five fingerprints (i.e. Ext. P-80
chance fingerprints) were lifted by him which was witnessed by two
witnesses (PW 5 and PW 9) who corroborated the fact. This Court has
held, previously that the possibility of others' presence at the crime
scene, and its contamination could be ruled out, because of the
deposition of these two witnesses, as well as other depositions. PW 17
obtained the fingerprint samples of Neha (Ext. P-43), which he deposed
to during
the trial. The deficiencies alleged by the appellants, in the opinion of
this Court, about the procedural lapses in the collection of such
evidence, are not convincing. The evidence of PW 24, as well as his
report (Ext. P-84) prove that a chance fingerprint (Sample E, collected
from the crime scene) matched with the sample obtained from her, by
PW 17 during the investigation.
188.4. The fourth circumstance, against Neha, which was
established during the trial-and a vital one, is her knowledge of the
crime. Her disclosure statement led to arrests of Rahul and Manoj, and
recovery of stolen and other articles from their possession. The
circumstances surrounding the manner of Neha's apprehension have
been disbelieved by this Court, as well as the testimony of PW 10 and
the TIP proceedings, during which he identified her.
189. As against Rahul, this Court has held that:
189.1. Firstly, the circumstances relating to his arrest (witnessed by
PW 3 and PW 6), on 22-6-2011 were proved by the prosecution.
189.2. The second circumstance proved is that his disclosure
statement led to recovery and seizure of stolen articles and other
articles connected with the crime (Ext. P-14), including two bent
golden bangles, part of broken mangalsutra, a country-made pistol, a
knife measuring 35.5 cm, and a photograph showing Rahul wearing
black diamond-like beaded bracelet.
189.3. The third circumstance is that, like with Neha, PW 1
identified the gold jewellery recovered from Rahul's possession, during
the TIP (further corroborated by PW 12).
189.4. The fourth circumstance proved is that PW 24 the fingerprint
expert, deposed that he found that Prints A and B lifted from the crime
scene (as corroborated by PW 5 and PW 9) matched with the index and
middle fingerprints, respectively of Rahul's right hand, in the sample
(Ext. P-41) collected from him by PW 17.
189.5. The fifth circumstance proved during the trial is that Rahul
had reported late in the evening of 19-6-2011, that he was shot on the
right foot, by unknown persons. This was recorded in the form of a
dehati nalisi against unknown persons; later an FIR (Ext. P-107) was
registered by PW 30 for the offences punishable under Sections 294,
307 and 34 IPC. Rahul was initially taken to District Hospital (proved by
the treatment card Ext. P-97 dated 19-6-2011). Rahul was however,
referred to M.Y. Hospital, and examined by PW 32, who operated upon
him. Ext. P-113 is the discharge card of M.Y. Hospital signed by PW 32
(who also deposed about it) on 20-6-2011. PW 29 who recorded the
initial report dehati nalisi, also identified Rahul as the boy who had
reported the incident. The bullet extracted from his foot was deposited
(under memo Ext. P-113) in the Medico-Legal Cell of the hospital, and
later seized (under memo Ext. P-108) on 23-6-2011. The FIR relating
to this case was later closed. The other fact proved is the seizure of a
right shoe (Ext. P-75) under jurisdiction of Annapurna PS (proved by
PW 20), which the trial court observed had a bullet hole at the top.
189.6. The sixth circumstance proved against Rahul, which is
material, is the ballistic report which stated that the two bullets (found
at the crime scene)
were compatible to the certified bullet of 7.65 mm calibre cartridge;
bullet TB-A1 was found similar. Three pieces of skin were found copper
positive. Importantly, according to the report, two bullets, EB2 and EB1
(recovered from the body of Megha, the deceased, and Rahul's right
foot, respectively) were fired from pistol Ext. A-1, seized from Rahul's
house. The report also stated that the gunshot fired at the seized right
shoe (mentioned above) was caused by a copper-jacketed bullet. All
this was proved by the ballistics report (Ext. P-120) that had analysed
each of these items. The report also revealed that the ballistics expert
(PW 16) had test fired from the pistol sent to FSL, and had found that
the pistol had signs that the two spent cartridges, were fired from it.
190. As against Manoj, this Court has held several circumstances to
have been proved:
190.1. The first circumstance proved against him, is his arrest and
subsequent disclosure statement, at 10.05 a.m. on 22-6-2011 (proved
by PW 3 and PW 6).
190.2. The second circumstance is the recovery and seizure of
articles, at Manoj's behest, and from his possession, including - two
golden bangles, portion of a broken mangalsutra, a knife and a
photograph with Manoj in sunglasses (Ext. P-17, also proved by same
witnesses).
190.3. The third circumstance proved against Manoj is that PW 1
identified the golden jewellery recovered from his possession, during
the TIP (corroborated by PW 12).
191. This Court is of the opinion that all the circumstances and the
link connecting them, was sufficiently established by the prosecution
and proved beyond reasonable doubt. Similarly, every hypothesis
suggesting the innocence of the appellants is ruled out by such
evidence, and the irresistible inference which follows, is their guilt.
192. In the opinion of this Court, the proof of the circumstances
against the appellants clearly points to their guilt, and involvement in
the crime. It appears that the appellants had informed themselves
about the deceased and their movement. Perhaps they kept a watch
over the area. Their common intention clearly was to rob the deceased,
who had newly shifted to Indore and into the locality, on 19-6-2011.
Though the exact time of occurrence is unknown, the post-mortem
report reflected the duration of death within 12 to 36 hours from the
time procedure started, which was after 11 a.m. on 20-6-2011. It is
reasonable to infer, therefore, that death occurred sometime during the
day, on 19-6-2011. Though the evidence of PW 10 has been
disbelieved, the evidence of PW 5, PW 9 and PW 2, shows that the
crime was noticed in the evening of 19-6-2011 when the bodies were
discovered, and the police reached the scene.
193. The nature and description of the injuries on the deceased
show that they had apparently put up a fight-which perhaps the
appellants had not expected. The intention to rob the deceased, and
coerce them into handing over their valuables, soon turned violent, due
to the unexpected fight put up against the accused. There are several
sharp-edged injuries, and one bullet injury which fatally wounded
Megha. As a result, it is evident that to subdue
the three deceased women, the accused resorted to frenzied knife
attacks. The persistent resistance given by the deceased, coupled with
the nature of injuries with sharp weapons (the two knives) were fatal to
both Rohini and Ashlesha. The fact that the accused had to repeatedly
stab them, reveals that the said appellants were not familiar with
wielding such a weapon. Weapons (2 knives and 1 pistol) have
specifically been recovered from the possession of Manoj and Rahul,
and in these circumstances, their conviction for the offences with which
they were charged, is justified.
194. Information as to how these attacks occurred within the house
of the deceased and the distinct roles played by the accused, are in the
special knowledge of only the accused; but no such information was
forthcoming through the course of the trial or appellate stage. This
Court69 has held that common intention requires prior meeting of mind,
which can also be developed on the spur of the moment, provided there
is premeditated concert. The circumstances reflect that there was a
clear common intention among the three accused, to rob the house,
and upon facing resistance - to complete the job and leave
undetected, by all means necessary.
195. While no weapon has been recovered from Neha, it is clear that
she was involved in the offences, and was present at the scene of the
crime. This is evidenced by firstly, the fingerprint expert's testimony
and report, which clearly reflects that her fingerprint was lifted from the
crime scene; secondly, the recovery of stolen articles (gold jewellery,
Megha's ATM card, etc.) from her possession; and thirdly, the fact that
Manoj and Rahul are only arrested pursuant to her disclosure of their
participation - all of which, cumulatively, clearly establish her
involvement. The lack of an overt or specific act of violence attributable
to Neha does not exonerate her, given that the prosecution has been
able to prove her presence at the crime scene and participation in the
commission of the offences, and that there was common object.
196. For the above reasons, all three accused are held guilty of the
offences under Sections 397/34, 449/34 and 302/34 IPC. Additionally,
Manoj and Rahul's conviction under Section 25(1-B)(b) of the Arms
Act, and Rahul's conviction under Section 27 of the Arms Act, is
upheld.
197. Before proceeding to consideration of the question of sentence,
this Court finds it necessary to briefly highlight the role of the Public
Prosecutor and the trial court in a criminal trial, so as to safeguard the
rights of the accused. The concealment of DW 1's role in this case's
investigation (her analysing of call detail records of the deceased and in
connection to Neha - which was not produced in trial; tip-off allegedly
received regarding Neha's whereabouts and what she would be
wearing; participating in Neha's arrest, and subsequent involvement on
23-6-2011 in recoveries of articles) points to concerning gaps in the
manner of investigation carried out initially, or at the very least, an
untruthful recollection and presentation of it, for the purposes of trial.
As elaborated earlier, these facts prompted this Court to draw adverse
inferences
against the prosecution's version of Neha's arrest. Other circumstances
have been proved sufficiently to conclude their guilt and result in
conviction.
198. However, it is appropriate to also point out that concealment of
DW 1's role and failure to include the call detail records, could have
severely prejudiced the accused, had these other circumstances not
been made out. Therefore, at this juncture, it is pertinent to note and
reiterate the role of the Public Prosecutor, and the trial court, in arriving
at the truth by way of fair disclosure and scrutiny by inquiry,
respectively.
199. A Public Prosecutor (appointed under Section 24 CrPC)
occupies a statutory office of high regard. Rather than a part of the
investigating agency, they are instead, an independent statutory
authority who serve as officers to the court71. The role of the Public
Prosecutor is intrinsically dedicated to conducting a fair trial, and not
for a "thirst to reach the case in conviction". This Court in Shiv Kumar
"13.
If an accused is entitled to any legitimate benefit during
trial the Public Prosecutor should not scuttle/conceal it. On the
contrary, it is the duty of the Public Prosecutor to winch it to the fore
and make it available to the accused."
200. In Manu Sharma V. State (NCT of Delhi)73 (hereafter "Manu
"187. Therefore, a Public Prosecutor has wider set of duties than
to merely ensure that the accused is punished, the duties of
ensuring fair play in the proceedings, all relevant facts are brought
before the court in order for the determination of truth and justice
for all the parties including the victims. It must be noted that these
duties do not allow the Prosecutor to be lax in any of his duties as
against the accused."
201. In Manu Sharma 73 the appellants in question had argued that
the right to fair trial included a wide duty of disclosure on the Public
Prosecutor, such that non-disclosure of any evidence - whether or not
relied upon by the prosecution-must be made available to the defence.
This Court considered Sections 207 and 208 CrPC, Rule 1674 of the Bar
Council of India Rules (which is limited to evidence on which the
Prosecutor proposes to rely on), and English
law. The Common law position culled out was that subject to exceptions
like sensitive information and public interest immunity, the prosecution
should disclose any material which might be exculpatory to the
defence. Such a position, however, was not accepted by this Court, in
its totality. It was held that such obligations are on a different footing
in India, given the fundamental canons of our criminal jurisprudence
founded on Articles 20 and 21 of the Constitution, which require not
just the investigating agency, but also courts in their own independent
field, to ensure that investigation is fair and does not hamper the
individual's freedom, except in accordance with law i.e. ensure
adherence to the rule of law.
202. Relevant extracts that merit repetition are : (Manu Sharma
"199. It is not only the responsibility of the investigating agency
but as well as that of the courts to ensure that investigation is fair
and does not in any way hamper the freedom of an individual except
in accordance with law. Equally enforceable canon of the criminal law
is that the high responsibility lies upon the investigating agency not
to conduct an investigation in tainted and unfair manner. The
investigation should not prima facie be indicative of a biased mind
and every effort should be made to bring the guilty to law as nobody
stands above law dehors his position and influence in the society.
*
*
*
201. Historically but consistently the view of this Court has been
that an investigation must be fair and effective, must proceed in
proper direction in consonance with the ingredients of the offence
and not in haphazard manner. In some cases besides investigation
being effective the accused may have to prove miscarriage of justice
but once it is shown the accused would be entitled to definite benefit
in accordance with law. The investigation should be conducted in a
manner so as to draw a just balance between citizen's right under
Articles 19 and 21 and expansive power of the police to make
investigation. These well-established principles have been stated by
this Court in Sasi Thomas V. State75, State of T.N. V. Surya
Sankaram Karri76 and T.T. Antony V. State of Kerala 77
202. In Nirmal Singh Kahlon V. State of this Court
specifically stated that a concept of fair investigation and fair trial
are concomitant to preservation of the fundamental right of the
accused under Article 21 of the Constitution of India. We have
referred to this concept of judicious and fair investigation as the
right of the accused to fair defence emerges from this concept itself.
The accused is not subjected to harassment, his right
to defence is not unduly hampered and what he is entitled to receive in
accordance with law is not denied to him contrary to law."
203. The scheme of the CrPC under Chapter XII (Information to
Police and Powers to Investigate) is clear - the police have the power
to investigate freely and fairly; in the course of which, it is mandatory
to maintain a diary where the day-to-day proceedings are to be
recorded with specific mention of time of events, places visited,
departure and reporting back, statements recorded, etc. While the
criminal court is empowered to summon these diaries under Section
172(2) for the purpose of inquiry or trial (and not as evidence), Section
173(3) makes it clear that the accused cannot claim any right to peruse
them, unless the police themselves, rely on it (to refresh their memory)
or if the court uses it for contradicting the testimony of the police
officers. 79
204. In Manu Sharma73, in the context of police diaries, this Court
noted that "[t]he purpose and the object seems to be quite clear that
there should be fairness in investigation, transparency and a record
should be maintained to ensure a proper investigation". This object is
rendered entirely meaningless if the police fail to maintain the police
diary accurately. Failure to meticulously note down the steps taken
during investigation, and the resulting lack of transparency,
undermines the accused's right to fair investigation; it is up to the trial
court that must take an active role in scrutinising the record
extensively, rather than accept the prosecution side willingly, so as to
bare such hidden or concealed actions taken during the course of
investigation. 80
205. In the present case, the trial court ought to have inquired more
deeply into the role of DW 1, given that by her own deposition she had
admitted to analysing call detail records and involvement in Neha's
arrest - all of which had been suppressed by the prosecution side, for
reasons best known to them. In this context, a reading of Sections 91
and 243 CrPC as done in Manu Sharma 73, is important to refer to :
"217.
Section 91 empowers the court to summon production of
any document or thing which the court considers necessary or
desirable for the purposes of any investigation, inquiry, trial or
another proceeding under the provisions of the Code. Where Section
91 read with Section 243 says that if the accused is called upon to
enter his defence and produce his evidence there he has also been
given the right to apply to the court for issuance of process for
compelling the attendance of any witness for the purpose of
examination, cross-examination or the production of any document
or other thing for which the court has to pass a reasoned order."
206. The Court went on to elaborate on the due process protection
afforded to the accused, and its effect on fair disclosure responsibilities
87, paras 218-222)
"218. The liberty of an accused cannot be interfered with except
under due process of law. The expression "due process of law" shall
deem to include fairness in trial. The court (sic Code) gives a right to
the accused to receive all documents and statements as well as to
move an application for production of any record or witness in
support of his case. This constitutional mandate and statutory rights
given to the accused place an implied obligation upon the
prosecution (prosecution and the Prosecutor) to make fair disclosure.
The concept of fair disclosure would take in its ambit furnishing of a
document which the prosecution relies upon whether filed in court or
not. That document should essentially be furnished to the accused
and even in the cases where during investigation a document is bona
fide obtained by the investigating agency and in the opinion of the
Prosecutor is relevant and would help in arriving at the truth, that
document should also be disclosed to the accused.
219. The role and obligation of the Prosecutor particularly in
relation to disclosure cannot be equated under our law to that
prevalent under the English system as aforereferred to. But at the
same time, the demand for a fair trial cannot be ignored. It may be
of different consequences where a document which has been
obtained suspiciously, fraudulently or by causing undue advantage
to the accused during investigation such document could be denied
in the discretion of the Prosecutor to the accused whether the
prosecution relies or not upon such documents, however in other
cases the obligation to disclose would be more certain. As already
noticed the provisions of Section 207 have a material bearing on this
subject and make an interesting reading. These provisions not only
require or mandate that the court without delay and free of cost
should furnish to the accused copies of the police report, first
information report, statements, confessional statements of the
persons recorded under Section 161 whom the prosecution wishes to
examine as witnesses, of course, excluding any part of a statement
or document as contemplated under Section 173(6) of the Code, any
other document or relevant extract thereof which has been
submitted to the Magistrate by the police under sub-section (5) of
Section 173. In contradistinction to the provisions of Section 173,
where the legislature has used the expression "documents on which
the prosecution relies" are not used under Section 207 of the Code.
Therefore, the provisions of Section 207 of the Code will have to be
given liberal and relevant meaning so as to achieve its object. Not
only this, the documents submitted to the Magistrate along with the
report under Section 173(5) would deem to include the documents
which have to be sent to the
Magistrate during the course of investigation as per the requirement of
Section 170(2) of the Code.
220. The right of the accused with regard to disclosure of
documents is a limited right but is codified and is the very
foundation of a fair investigation and trial. On such matters, the
accused cannot claim an indefeasible legal right to claim every
document of the police file or even the portions which are permitted
to be excluded from the documents annexed to the report under
Section 173(2) as per orders of the court. But certain rights of the
accused flow both from the codified law as well as from equitable
concepts of the constitutional jurisdiction, as substantial variation to
such procedure would frustrate the very basis of a fair trial. To claim
documents within the purview of scope of Sections 207, 243 read
with the provisions of Section 173 in its entirety and power of the
court under Section 91 of the Code to summon documents signifies
and provides precepts which will govern the right of the accused to
claim copies of the statement and documents which the prosecution
has collected during investigation and upon which they rely.
221. It will be difficult for the Court to say that the accused has
no right to claim copies of the documents or request the Court for
production of a document which is part of the general diary subject
to satisfying the basic ingredients of law stated therein. A document
which has been obtained bona fide and has bearing on the case of
the prosecution and in the opinion of the Public Prosecutor, the same
should be disclosed to the accused in the interest of justice and fair
investigation and trial should be furnished to the accused. Then that
document should be disclosed to the accused giving him chance of
fair defence, particularly when non-production or disclosure of such a
document would affect administration of criminal justice and the
defence of the accused prejudicially.
222. The concept of disclosure and duties of the Prosecutor under
the English system cannot, in our opinion, be made applicable to the
Indian criminal jurisprudence stricto sensu at this stage. However,
we are of the considered view that the doctrine of disclosure would
have to be given somewhat expanded application. As far as the
present case is concerned, we have already noticed that no prejudice
had been caused to the right of the accused to fair trial and non-
furnishing of the copy of one of the ballistic reports had not
hampered the ends of justice. Some shadow of doubt upon veracity
of the document had also been created by the prosecution and the
prosecution opted not to rely upon this document. In these
circumstances, the right of the accused to disclosure has not
received any setback in the facts and circumstances of the case. The
accused even did not raise this issue seriously before the trial court."
(emphasis supplied)
207. In this manner, the Public Prosecutor, and then the trial court's
scrutiny, both play an essential role in safeguarding the accused's right
to fair investigation, when faced with the might of the State's police
machinery.
208. This view was endorsed in a recent three-Judge Bench decision
of this Court in Criminal Trials Guidelines Regarding Inadequacies &
81
Deficiencies, In re V. State of A.P. This
Court
has
highlighted
the
inadequacy mentioned above, which would impede a fair trial, and inter
alia, required the framing of rules by all States and High Courts, in this
regard, compelling disclosure of a list containing mention of all
materials seized and taken in, during investigation-to the accused. The
relevant draft guideline, approved by this Court, for adoption by all
"21.
4. Supply of documents under Sections 173, 207
and
208 CrPC.-(1) Every accused shall be supplied with
statements of witness recorded under Sections 161 and 164 CrPC
and a list of documents, material objects and exhibits seized during
investigation and relied upon by the investigating officer (IO) in
accordance with Sections 207 and 208 CrPC.
Explanation : The list of statements, documents, material objects
and exhibits shall specify statements, documents, material objects
and exhibits that are not relied upon by the investigating officer."
209. In view of the above discussion, this Court holds that the
prosecution, in the interests of fairness, should as a matter of rule, in
all criminal trials, comply with the above rule, and furnish the list of
statements, documents, material objects and exhibits which are not
relied upon by the investigating officer. The presiding officers of courts
in criminal trials shall ensure compliance with such rules.
On sentence
210. The hearing of this case was adjourned for sentencing on a
subsequent date, before which the learned counsel submitted material
regarding the lives of the accused - both before the incident and post-
conviction by the trial court, jail reports and other material called for by
this Court were received from the State, and written submissions were
filed by both sides.
211. In the course of arguments, the learned AAG maintained that
there were no mitigating circumstances and the cruelty evident from
the nature of the crime, warrants nothing less than the capital
punishment, which according to her was correctly imposed,
concurrently. It was submitted that it is in cases like the present one,
where the "rarest of rare" doctrine needs to be invoked as a deterrent.
212. On the other hand the counsel for the accused laid emphasis on
the fact that neither of the courts below had even considered the
possibility of reform of the accused who were all of young age and
barring Manoj (who had been involved in a petty offence in the past)
the others did not have any criminal antecedents. The counsel also
argued that an overall look at the circumstances, at best, could lead the
Court to conclude that the extensive injuries inflicted
upon the deceased were in all probability on account of the plans of the
accused going awry, upon their encountering the victims' resistance. It
was submitted besides that the potential of each convict to be reformed
- both having regard to their previous backgrounds, as well as conduct
in jail during pendency of trial and confirmation, was not considered.
This amounted to an infraction of the rule in Bachan Singh V. State of
Punjab
213. The counsel relied on numerous judgments relating to the
importance of considering mitigating circumstances, the State's role in
demonstrating the accused is beyond reformation, mitigating
circumstances such as age and socio-economic background, pre-
sentence hearing - its scope and the court's obligation, etc.
214. Capital punishment is prescribed in numerous IPC offences,
including murder, kidnapping for ransom, rape and injury causing
death or leaving a woman in a vegetative state, rape or gang rape of a
child below 12 years' old, dacoity with murder, among other offences.
In Bachan Singh V. State of Punjab82 (hereafter "Bachan Singh"), this
Court had upheld the imposition of death penalty as an alternate
punishment under Section 302 IPC on the strength of the 35th Report
of the Law Commission of India (1967), the judgment in Jagmohan
Singh V. State of U.P. 83 (which had also noted that the 35th Report
advocated for retention) and in several subsequent cases decided by
this Court, in which the death penalty was recognised to be a deterrent.
It laid emphasis on the then recently added Sections 253(2) and 354
(3) CrPC which provide for bifurcated pre-sentence hearing and
sentencing procedure on conviction of capital offences, to conclude that
this form of punishment continued to have legislative backing and
thereby, represented the will of the people.
215. It is undeniable that there have been shifts in how punishment
in capital offences are dealt with. This is apparent when developments
are looked at holistically, or at a macrolevel : the amendments to the
CrPC by Parliament, the 35th and 262nd Law Commission Reports
which stand over 30 years apart, and the precedents of this Court,
across the decades. Initially, the law imposed a requirement of written
reasons for not imposing death penalty, which was removed in 1955. In
1973, through further amendment to the CrPC and insertion of Section
354(3) - life imprisonment became the norm and imposition of death
penalty required "special reasons"; and through Section 253(2) -
sentencing required separate consideration from the question of
conviction. In both phases i.e. post-1955 and post-1973, capital
punishment was upheld to be constitutional by five-Judge Benches of
this Court in Jagmohan Singh83 and Bachan Singh respectively.
216. The 262nd Law Commission Report on Death Penalty (2015)
(hereafter "the 262nd Report"), is a result of this Court's references in
primarily two cases. Firstly, in Santosh Kumar Satishbhushan Bariyar V.
State of Maharashtra84 (hereafter "Santosh Bariyar") where, after taking
note
of the UN General Assembly Resolution 62/14985 85 it was pointed out
that credible research was required to shape an informed discussion
and debate, on the contentious issue of death sentence. Secondly, the
judgment in Shankar Kisanrao Khade V. State of Maharashtra86 tasked
the Law Commission to resolve the issue of whether death penalty is a
deterrent punishment, is retributive justice, or serves an incapacitative
goal; and to study the difference in approach adopted by the judiciary
(rarest of rare) and the executive (what was termed as unknown) while
granting commutation. In attempting to fulfil this mandate, the
Commission discerned an urgent need for re-examination of its own
earlier recommendations on the death penalty (in its 35th Report,
1967), given the drastic change in social, economic, and cultural
contexts of the country since the 35th Report, and arbitrariness which
has remained a major concern in the adjudication of death penalty
cases since Bachan Singh laid down the foundational principle of
"rarest of rare".
217. Reflective of changed circumstances and evolving discourse,
the Report marks a shift in the approach towards the death penalty in
India, going so far as to recommend abolition in all offences, except
those relating to terrorism. A large part of the Report focusses on
courts' discretion and judicial reasoning when it comes to sentencing. It
concludes that death penalty sentencing in India has been based on an
arbitrary application of the Bachan Singh principle, and has become
Judge-centric, based on the personal predilection of Judges - a
concern which was alluded to even by this Court in Swamy
Shraddananda (2) V. State of Karnataka87 and analysed extensively
again in Santosh Bariyar84, followed by Sangeet V. State of Haryana888,
Mohd. Farooq Abdul Gafur V. State of Maharashtra89, and more recently
in Chhannu Lal Verma V. State of Chhattisgarh 90 (hereafter "Chhannu
Lal Verma").
The death penalty framework and how to apply it for "principled
sentencing"
218. This Court in Bachan Singh while upholding the
constitutionality of capital punishment, categorically ruled that the new
CrPC of 1973 marked a shift as it bifurcated the criminal trial to include
a pre-sentence hearing [under Section 235(2)], and further mandated
the sentencing court to outline the "special reasons" [under Section
354(3)] or absence of them, by considering circumstances both of the
crime and the criminal. The Court also noted that while broad
guidelines or indicators may be given, they cannot be put into water-
tight compartments that curb discretion of any Judge to do justice in a
"1
Now, Section 235(2) provides for a bifurcated trial and
specifically gives the accused person a right of pre-sentence hearing,
at which stage, he can bring on record material or evidence, which
may not be strictly relevant to or connected with the particular crime
under inquiry, but nevertheless, have, consistently with the policy
underlined in Section 354(3), a bearing on the choice of sentence.
The present legislative policy discernible from Section 235(2) read
with Section 354(3) is that in fixing the degree of punishment or
making the choice of sentence for various offences, including one
under Section 302 of the Penal Code, the court should not confine its
consideration "principally" or merely to the circumstances connected
with the particular crime, but also give due consideration to the
circumstances of the criminal.

*
201.
As we read Sections 354(3) and 235(2) and other related
provisions of the 1973 Code, it is quite clear to us that for making
the choice of punishment or for ascertaining the existence or
absence of "special reasons" in that context, the court must pay due
regard both to the crime and the criminal. What is the relative
weight to be given to the aggravating and mitigating factors,
depends on the facts and circumstances of the particular case. More
often than not, these two aspects are so intertwined that it is
difficult to give a separate treatment to each of them. This is so
because "style is the man". In many cases, the extremely cruel or
beastly manner of the commission of murder is itself a demonstrated
index of the depraved character of the perpetrator. That is why, it is
not desirable to consider the circumstances of the crime and the
circumstances of the criminal in two separate watertight
compartments. In a sense, to kill is to be cruel and therefore all
murders are cruel. But such cruelty may vary in its degree of
culpability. And it is only when the culpability assumes the
proportion of extreme depravity that "special reasons" can
legitimately be said to exist."
(emphasis in original)
219. The Court also accepted a list of helpful factors of aggravating
82
and mitigating circumstances. However, cautioning the court from
treating them to be exhaustive. the Court further clarified that thev
were merely indicative and that the mitigating circumstances had to be
read in a "liberal and expansive" manner, accounting for the dignity of
"209. There are numerous other circumstances justifying the
passing of the lighter sentence; as there are countervailing
circumstances of aggravation. 'We cannot obviously feed into a
judicial computer all such situations since they are astrological
imponderables in an imperfect and undulating society." Nonetheless,
it cannot be over-emphasised that the scope and concept of
mitigating factors in the area of death penalty must receive a liberal
and expansive construction by the courts in accord with
the sentencing policy writ large in Section 354(3). Judges should never
be bloodthirsty. Hanging of murderers has never been too good for
them. Facts and figures, albeit incomplete, furnished by the Union of
India, show that in the past, courts have inflicted the extreme penalty
with extreme infrequency - a fact which attests to the caution and
compassion which they have always brought to bear on the exercise of
their sentencing discretion in so grave a matter. It is, therefore,
imperative to voice the concern that courts, aided by the broad
illustrative guidelines indicated by us, will discharge the onerous
function with evermore scrupulous care and humane concern, directed
along the highroad of legislative policy outlined in Section 354(3) viz.
that for persons convicted of murder, life imprisonment is the rule and
death sentence an exception. A real and abiding concern for the dignity
of human life postulates resistance to taking a life through law's
instrumentality. That ought not to be done save in the rarest of rare
cases when the alternative option is unquestionably foreclosed."
220. In Machhi Singh91, this Court extrapolated the principles from
489, paras 38-40)
"38. In this background the guidelines indicated in Bachan Singh
case 82 will have to be culled out and applied to the facts of each
individual case where the question of imposing of death sentence
arises. The following propositions emerge from Bachan Singh case82:
(i) The extreme penalty of death need not be inflicted except in
gravest cases of extreme culpability.
(ii) Before opting for the death penalty the circumstances of
the "offender" also require to be taken into consideration along
with the circumstances of the "crime".
(iii) Life imprisonment is the rule and death sentence is an
exception. In other words death sentence must be imposed only
when life imprisonment appears to be an altogether inadequate
punishment having regard to the relevant circumstances of the
crime, and provided, and only provided, the option to impose
sentence of imprisonment for life cannot be conscientiously
exercised having regard to the nature and circumstances of the
crime and all the relevant circumstances.
(iv) A balance sheet of aggravating and mitigating
circumstances has to be drawn up and in doing so the mitigating
circumstances have to be accorded full weightage and a just
balance has to be struck between the aggravating and the
mitigating circumstances before the option is exercised.
39. In order to apply these guidelines inter alia the following
questions may be asked and answered:
(a) Is there something uncommon about the crime which
renders sentence of imprisonment for life inadequate and calls for
a death sentence?
(b) Are the circumstances of the crime such that there is no
alternative but to impose death sentence even after according
maximum weightage to the mitigating circumstances which speak
in favour of the offender?
40. If upon taking an overall global view of all the circumstances
in the light of the aforesaid proposition and taking into account the
answers to the questions posed hereinabove, the circumstances of
the case are such that death sentence is warranted, the court would
proceed to do so."
221. In Machhi Singh91, this Court also attempted to categorise
cases under broadly five heads (i.e. manner of commission of murder,
motive, anti-social or socially abhorrent nature of the crime, magnitude
of crime, and personality of victim), by strongly analysing the
aggravating circumstances of the crime. A formalistic reliance on these
categories however, has the potential of leading any court awry as it
has the unintended effect of drawing attention away from the criminal,
and focussing disproportionately on the crime - the dangers of this
standardisation was also noted by this Court in Swamy Shraddananda
(2)87, Sangeet and more recently in Sanjiv Khanna, J.'s dissenting
opinion in Manoharan V. State9
222. This Court in Bachan Singh82 had warned against categorising
cases. Rejecting the contention that standards and guidelines should
93
be laid down, it was noted in Bachan Singh82 that degree of culpability
cannot be measured, and aggravating and mitigating circumstances
could not be rigidly enumerated so as to exclude "all free play of
discretion". Reiterating that criminal cases cannot be categorised as
there were infinite, unpredictable and unforeseen variations, it was held
that by such categorisation, the sentencing process would cease to be
judicial, and such standardisation or sentencing discretion is beyond
the court's function. Therefore, it would be befitting if reliance were
placed not solely on those five categories of crimes (which lays undue
emphasis on aggravating circumstances) enumerated in Machhi
Singh91, and instead on the two-question test, and the four guiding
principles of Bachan Singh82 that were succinctly culled out in Machhi
Singh91
223. The decades that followed, have witnessed a line of judgments
in which this Court has continually taken judicial notice of the
incongruence in application of the "rarest of rare" test enunciated in
Bachan Singh and therefore, tried to restrict imposition of the death
penalty, in an attempt to strengthen a principled application of the
same.
224. This aspect was dealt with extensively in Santosh Bariyar84
where the Court articulated the test to be a two-step process to
determine whether a case deserves the death sentence - firstly, that
the case belongs to the "rarest of rare" category, and secondly, that the
option of life imprisonment would simply not suffice. For the first step,
the aggravating and mitigating circumstances would have to be
identified and considered equally. For the second test, the court had to
consider whether the alternative of life imprisonment was
unquestionably foreclosed as the sentencing aim of reformation was
unachievable, for which the State must provide material.
225. About four years later, in Sangeet this Court lamented the
continuing lack of attention given to circumstances of the criminal,
reiterated that balancing of aggravating-mitigating circumstances and
failure to apply the Bachan Singh sentencing framework uniformly,
was leading to Judge-centric and inconsistent jurisprudence in death
penalty matters.
226. In Shankar Kisanrao Khade this Court developed yet another
framework of the "crime test", criminal test" and "rarest of rare
test" (which was held to be distinct from the "balance test" that was
discouraged in Santosh Bariyar84 and subsequently, in Sangeet 88 as
"52.
In my considered view, the tests that we have to apply,
while awarding death sentence are "crime test", "criminal test" and
the "R-R test" and not the "balancing test". To award death
sentence, the "crime test" has to be fully satisfied, that is, 100% and
"criminal test" 0%, that is, no mitigating circumstance favouring the
accused. If there is any circumstance favouring the accused, like lack
of intention to commit the crime, possibility of reformation, young
age of the accused, not a menace to the society, no previous track
record, etc. the "criminal test" may favour the accused to avoid the
capital punishment. Even if both the tests are satisfied, that is, the
aggravating circumstances to the fullest extent and no mitigating
circumstances favouring the accused, still we have to apply finally
the rarest of the rare case test (R-R test). R-R test depends upon the
perception of the society that is "society-centric" and not "Judge-
centric", that is, whether the society will approve the awarding of
death sentence to certain types of crimes or not. While applying that
test, the court has to look into variety of factors like society's
abhorrence, extreme indignation and antipathy to certain types of
crimes like sexual assault and murder of intellectually challenged
minor girls, suffering from physical disability, old and infirm women
with those disabilities, etc. Examples are only illustrative and not
exhaustive. The courts award death sentence since situation
demands so,
due to constitutional compulsion, reflected by the will of the people and
not the will of the Judges."
227. Recently, while considering a review petition, this Court in
Rajendra Pralhadrao Wasnik V. State of Maharashtra94 held that Bachan
Singh had intended the test to be "probability" and not improbability,
possibility or impossibility of reformation and rehabilitation as a
mandate of Section 354(4) CrPC. 94 The Court analysed numerous
earlier precedents, noting that evidence by the State on this has been
sparse and limited, but was essential for the courts to measure the
probability of reform, rehabilitation and reintegration. The Court located
this requirement in the right of the accused, who regardless of being
95
ruthless, was entitled to a life of dignity, notwithstanding his crime.
While this process is not easy, it was noted that neither is the process
of rehabilitation since it involves reintegration into society. When this is
found to be not possible in certain cases, a longer duration of
imprisonment was instead permissible.
Uneven application of this framework and (in) consistency in
sentencing
228. An overall analysis of capital punishment cases decided by this
Court will perhaps reflect that that there is in fact, no pattern. While
there are real and valid concerns in the non-uniform application of the
Bachan Singh82 framework, discretion in sentencing, in itself - is not
worrisome, and the concern needs to be dispelled. While generally
Judges may look to precedents for the comfort of numbers, that process
only gives an indication of how similar instances have been dealt with
and has a limited role when it comes to sentencing. The discretion
afforded to the court in sentencing, is not for it to be Judge-centric or
result in disparate rulings, but in fact to enable the court with the
flexibility of considering the case-specific factors relating to the crime
and criminal, without falling into predetermined patterns. Sentencing is
not a mathematical equation and ought not be seen as one. This has
been recognised in numerous cases starting from Bachan Singh 82 itself.
229. In Santosh Bariyar84, analysing the equality principle, due
process and proportionality requirement in capital sentencing, it was
held that rather than applying strict classification of the type of
offences that warrant death sentence, the court must focus on equally
considering the aggravating and mitigating circumstances (in which
commonality is to be drawn across case), and arrive at individualised
sentencing outcomes on a case-to-case basis. It was noted
:
"132.
The imprecision of the identification of aggravating and
mitigating circumstances has to be minimised. It is to be noted that
the mandate of equality clause applies to the sentencing process
rather than the outcome. The comparative review must be
undertaken not to channel
the sentencing discretion available to the courts but to bring in
consistency in identification of various relevant circumstances. The
aggravating and mitigating circumstances have to be separately
identified under a rigorous measure.
133. Bachan Singh 82 when mandates principled precedent-based
sentencing, compels careful scrutiny of mitigating circumstances and
aggravating circumstances and then factoring in a process by which
aggravating and mitigating circumstances appearing from the pool of
comparable cases can be compared. The weight which is accorded by
the court to particular aggravating and mitigating circumstances
may vary from case to case in the name of individualised sentencing,
but at the same time reasons for apportionment of weights shall be
forthcoming. Such a comparison may point out excessiveness as also
will help repel arbitrariness objections in future. A sentencing
hearing, comparative review of cases and similarly aggravating and
mitigating circumstances analysis can only be given a go-by if the
sentencing court opts for life imprisonment."
(emphasis supplied)
230. The strength of "precedent" and "consistency" is perhaps,
therefore, lowest when it comes to matters of sentencing, as long as it
is within the confines of legality and resulting in "principled
sentencing". In other words, the judicial incongruence when it relates
to sentencing, would in fact be a positive indicator, rather than a
negative one, provided it is still within the well-defined contours of
"principled" sentencing. For sentencing in capital offences, discretion to
arrive at individualised sentences is encouraged, but must be
constrained by the "rarest of rare" principle, wherein the court
considers aggravating circumstances of the crime, and mitigating
circumstances of the criminal (a "liberal and expansive" construction of
the latter), which in turn must inform their consideration of whether the
option of life imprisonment is unquestionably foreclosed owing to an
impossibility to reform.
231. Deviation from this principle i.e. unguided discretion on the
other hand, would quite obviously lead to bad law. For instance, Ravji
V. State of Rajasthan97 (hereafter "Ravji"), in complete contravention of
this Court's earlier Constitution Bench decision of Bachan Singh
(which focussed on both the crime, and criminal), held that " It is the
nature and gravity of the crime but not the criminal, which are germane
for consideration of appropriate punishment in a criminal trial". A line of
98
cases
, further relied on this (in this Court's considered opinion,
incorrect) decision in Ravji case97, and concluded that the nature and
gravity of the crime (i.e. its brutality or heinousness), were sufficient to
impose capital punishment, without considering mitigating
circumstances of the criminal. Subsequently, the decision in Ravji97
was-quite correctly-declared to be per incuriam by another Bench of
this Court in Santosh Bariyar84, for non-consideration of circumstances
of the criminal. Other cases that have focussed on brutality of the
crime, as negating or washing away the need to consider mitigating
circumstances, similarly serve as bad precedent.
232. This Court in Rajesh Kumar V. State99 again reiterated that
brutality in itself, was not enough to impose death sentence - the
accused was convicted for murder of two children who offered no
provocation or resistance to the brutal and inhuman fashion in which
the accused committed the crime, however, it was held that due
consideration to the mitigating circumstances of the criminal still had to
be given. Evidence had to be placed on record by the State,
demonstrating that he was beyond reform or rehabilitation, the absence
of which was a mitigating circumstance in itself. The High Court had
merely noted that he was a first-time offender and had a family to take
care of - which this Court noted was a very narrow and myopic view on
the mitigating circumstances.
233. Therefore, "individualised, principled sentencing" - based on
both the crime and criminal, with consideration of whether reform or
rehabilitation is achievable (held to be "probable" in Rajendra
Pralhadrao Wasnik94), and consequently whether the option of life
imprisonment is unquestionably foreclosed - should be the only factor
of "commonality" that must be discernible from decisions relating to
capital offences. With the creation of a new sentencing threshold in
Swamy Shraddananda (2)8-st, and later affirmed by a Constitution Bench
in Union of India V. V. Sriharan100 of life imprisonment without
statutory remission (i.e. Articles 72 and 161 of the Constitution are still
applicable), yet another option exists, before imposition of death
sentence. However, serious concern has been raised against this
concept, as it was upheld by a narrow majority, and is left to be
considered at an appropriate time.
Theories of punishment
234. The 262nd Report speaks extensively to the penological
justification of the death penalty. It finds that there is inconclusive
evidence that this form of punishment has more of a deterrent effect, in
comparison to life imprisonment. Dismissing the retributive theory of
punishment on the ground that it suffers from lack of guidance on
quantifying the punishment that would be appropriate to impose, it
categorically states that:
"7.1.2. Capital punishment fails to achieve any constitutionally
valid penological goals.
7.1.3. focusing on death penalty as the ultimate measure of
justice to victims, the restorative and rehabilitative aspects of justice
are lost sight of. Reliance on the death penalty diverts attention from
other problems ailing the criminal justice system such as poor
investigation, crime prevention and rights of victims of crime."
235. While the 262nd Report recommends abolition of the death
penalty on this ground, in addition to sentencing having become Judge-
centric or arbitrary, it has not prompted parliamentary intervention.
Whether the death penalty deserves a relook [as recommended by
Kurian Joseph, J. (dissenting) in Chhannu Lal Verma90 ], in light of the
90
262nd Law Commission Report, evolving jurisprudence, public
discourse and international standards of human rights, is outside the
purview of this Court's jurisdiction given the Constitution Bench
decision in Bachan Singh and a question best left for the legislature
to critically consider. In this backdrop, what this Court can do, is try
and bolster the existing sentencing framework. This is possible only by
giving true meaning to the existing guidelines (without falling into the
trap of "categorising" crimes that automatically warrant death penalty).
To do so, this Court finds it necessary to lay out certain practical
guidelines (elaborated below) that can facilitate consideration of
mitigating circumstances as recognised in Bachan Singh and
82
consequently ensure uniform application of this framework.
236. The 262nd Report recognised the paradigm shift, in policy and
discourse, towards a reformative and rehabilitative response to crime,
and the development of jurisprudence such that adjudging a case to be
"rarest of rare" was not sufficient, and special emphasis had to be
placed in considering whether the offender is amenable to reform.
Implicit in this shift is the understanding that the criminal is not a
product of only their own decisions, but also a product of the State and
society's failing, which is what entitles the accused to a chance of
reformation. Thus, making life imprisonment the norm, and death
penalty the exception. In Lehna V. State of Haryana101 while deciding
whether the facts in that case were appropriate for death penalty,
"14.
Section 302 IPC prescribes death or life imprisonment as
the penalty for murder. While doing so, the Code instructs the court
as to its application. The changes which the Code has undergone in
the last three decades clearly indicate that Parliament is taking note
of contemporary criminological thought and movement. It is not
difficult to discern that in the Code, there is a definite swing towards
life imprisonment. Death sentence is ordinarily ruled out and can
only be imposed for "special reasons", as provided in Section 354(3).
There is another provision in the Code which also uses the significant
expression "special reason". It is Section 361. Section 360 of the
1973 Code re-enacts, in substance, Section 562 of the Criminal
Procedure Code, 1898 (in short "the old
Code"). Section 361 which is a new provision in the Code makes it
mandatory for the court to record "special reasons" for not applying the
provisions of Section 360. Section 361 thus casts a duty upon the court
to apply the provisions of Section 360 wherever it is possible to do so
and to state "special reasons" if it does not do so. In the context of
Section 360, the "special reasons" contemplated by Section 361 must
be such as to compel the court to hold that it is impossible to reform
and rehabilitate the offender after examining the matter with due
regard to the age, character and antecedents of the offender and the
circumstances in which the offence was committed. This is some
indication by the legislature that reformation and rehabilitation of
offenders and not mere deterrence, are now among the foremost
objects of the administration of criminal justice in our country. Section
361 and Section 354(3) have both entered the statute book at the
same time and they are part of the emerging picture of acceptance by
the legislature of the new trends in criminology. It would not, therefore,
be wrong to assume that the personality of the offender as revealed by
his age, character, antecedents and other circumstances and the
tractability of the offender to reform must necessarily play the most
prominent role in determining the sentence to be awarded. Special
reasons must have some relation to these factors. Criminal justice deals
with complex human problems and diverse human beings. A Judge has
The surest way't to legal research!"
to balance the personality of the offender with the circumstances,
situations and the reactions and choose the appropriate sentence to be
imposed."
(emphasis supplied)
237. Mitigating factors in general, rather than excuse or validate the
crime committed, seek to explain the surrounding circumstances of the
criminal to enable the Judge to decide between the death penalty or life
imprisonment. An illustrative list of indicators first recognised in
"206.
Mitigating circumstances.- In the exercise of its
discretion in the above cases, the court shall take into account the
following circumstances:
(1) That the offence was committed under the influence of
extreme mental or emotional disturbance.
(2) The age of the accused. If the accused is young or old, he
shall not be sentenced to death.
(3) The probability that the accused would not commit criminal
acts of violence as would constitute a continuing threat to society.
(4) The probability that the accused can be reformed and
rehabilitated.
The State shall by evidence prove that the accused does not
satisfy Conditions (3) and (4) above.
(5) That in the facts and circumstances of the case the accused
believed that he was morally justified in committing the offence.
(6) That the accused acted under the duress or domination of
another person.
(7) That the condition of the accused showed that he was
mentally defective and that the said defect impaired his capacity
to appreciate the criminality of his conduct."
These are hardly exhaustive; subsequently, this Court in several
judgments has recognised, and considered commutation to life
imprisonment, on grounds such as young age102, socio-economic
conditions103 , mental illness104 criminal antecedents105, , as relevant
indicators on the questions of sentence. Many of these factors reflect
demonstrable ability or merely the possibility even, of the accused to
reform [i.e. (3) and (4) of the Bachan Singh list], which make them
important indicators when it comes to sentencing.
Pre-sentence hearing - Opportunity and obligation to provide
material on the accused
238. This Court in Bachan Singh 82 held that the introduction of pre-
sentencing hearing to the accused in 1973 through Section 235(2)
CrPC altered the Jagmohan Singh83 principle that the court is primarily
concerned with the circumstances connected with crime. Therefore, now
due consideration has to be given to the circumstances of the criminal
as well, when adjudicating whether the case falls within "rarest of rare"
and if the option of life imprisonment as an alternative, is
unquestionably foreclosed. In Bachan Singh this Court categorically
stated that, "[t]he probability that the accused would not commit
criminal acts of violence as would constitute a continuing threat to the
society", is a relevant circumstance, that must be given great weight in
the determination of sentence.
239. The sentencing hearing contemplated under Section 235(2), is
not confined merely to oral hearing but intended to afford a real
opportunity to the prosecution as well as the accused, to place on
record facts and material relating to various factors on the question of
sentence and if interested by either side, to have evidence adduced to
show mitigating circumstances to impose a lesser sentence or
106
aggravating grounds to impose death penalty.
240. In the absence of an individual's capacity to effectively bring
forth mitigating factors, this Court in Bachan Singh 82 placed the burden
of eliciting mitigating circumstances on the court, which has to consider
them liberally and expansively, whereas the responsibility of providing
material to show that the accused is beyond the scope of reform or
rehabilitation, thereby unquestionably foreclosing the option of life
imprisonment and making it a fit case for imposition of death penalty,
is one which falls squarely on the State. This has been reiterated and
further spelt out by this Court in Santosh Bariyar84, Rajesh Kumar99,
Chhannu Lal Verma90, and other decisions 107
241. In Santosh Bariyar84, making observations on nature of
information to be collected at the pre-sentencing stage, this Court
"56. At this stage, Bachan Singh82 informs the content of the
sentencing hearing. The court must play a proactive role to record all
relevant information at this stage. Some of the information relating
to crime can be culled out from the phase prior to sentencing
hearing. This information would include aspects relating to the
nature, motive and impact of crime, culpability of convict, etc.
Quality of evidence adduced is also a relevant factor. For instance,
extent of reliance on circumstantial evidence or child witness plays
an important role in the sentencing analysis. But what is sorely
lacking, in most capital sentencing cases, is information relating to
characteristics and socio-economic background of the offender. This
issue was also raised in the 48th Report of the Law Commission."
(emphasis supplied)
242. The State's duty is heightened in importance even more so, in
the Indian context where a majority of the accused have a poor or
rudimentary level of legal representation. The importance of collecting
socio-economic factors in the context of our criminal justice system was
critically noted by the 262nd Report as follows:
"7.1.6. Numerous committee reports as well as judgments of the
Supreme Court have recognised that the administration of criminal
justice in the country is in deep crisis. Lack of resources, outdated
modes of investigation, over-stretched police force, ineffective
prosecution, and poor legal aid are some of the problems besetting
the system. Death penalty operates within this context and therefore
suffers from the same structural and systemic impediments. The
administration of capital punishment thus remains fallible and
vulnerable to misapplication. The vagaries of the system also operate
disproportionately against the socially and
economically marginalised who may lack the resources to effectively
advocate their rights within an adversarial criminal justice system."
243. However, despite over four decades since Bachan Singh there
has been little to no policy-driven change, towards formulating a
scheme or system that elaborates how mitigating circumstances are to
be collected, for the court's consideration. Scarce information about the
accused at the time of sentencing, severely disadvantages the process
of considering mitigating circumstances. It is clarified that mere
mention of these circumstances by the counsel, serves no purpose -
rather, they must be connected to the possibility of reformation and
assist principled judicial reasoning [as required under Section 235(2)
CrPC]. Constrained by this lack of assistance, this Court (as mentioned
above) in Rajesh Kumar99 has even gone so far as to hold that the very
fact that the State had not given any evidence to show that the convict
was beyond reform and rehabilitation was a mitigating circumstance, in
itself.
244. The lack of forthcoming information has led to attempts by the
courts, to look backwards-sometimes many years after the crime has
been committed-to evaluate on the one hand, circumstances that
could not have been paused in time, and on the other those which can
be captured, but for which there exists no frame of reference from the
past, for comparison. This inconsistency in some courts calling for
reports, while others fail to - further contributes to our patchwork
jurisprudence on capital sentencing, and in turn undermines the
equality principle and due process protection that Santosh Bariyar84
recognises as existing, in favour of death row convicts.
245. The move to call for a Probation Officer's Report108 (as done by
this Court even in this case), is in fact a desperate attempt by the
courts at the appellate stage, to obtain information on the accused - at
present. Good conduct of the accused at the post-conviction stage in
prison (through a jail report), and psychiatric evaluation to evaluate
possibility of reform (albeit at the appellate sentencing stage), were
considered recently in Chhannu Lal Verma90 as necessary indicators for
"15.
Since the appellant has been in jail, we wanted to know
whether there was any attempt on his part for reformation. The
Superintendent of the jail has given a certificate that his conduct in
jail has been good. Thus, there is a clear indication that despite
having lost all hope, yet no frustration has set on the appellant. On
the contrary, there was a conscious effort on his part to lead a good
life for the remaining period. A convict is sent to jail with the hope
and expectation that he would make amends and get reformed.
That there is such a positive change on a death row convict, in our
view, should also weigh with the Court while taking a decision as to
whether the alternative option is unquestionably foreclosed. As held by
the Constitution Bench in Bachan Singh82 it was the duty of the State
to prove by evidence that the convict cannot be reformed or
rehabilitated. That information not having been furnished by the State
at the relevant time, the information now furnished by the State
becomes all the more relevant. The standard set by the "rarest of rare"
test in Bachan Singh82 is a high standard. The conduct of the convict in
prison cannot be lost sight of. The fact that the prisoner has displayed
good behaviour in prison certainly goes on to show that he is not
beyond reform.
16. In the matter of probability and possibility of reform of a
criminal, we do not find that a proper psychological/psychiatric
evaluation is done. Without the assistance of such a
psychological/psychiatric assessment and evaluation it would not be
proper to hold that there is no possibility or probability of reform.
The State has to bear in mind this important aspect while proving by
evidence that the convict cannot be reformed or rehabilitated."
(emphasis supplied)
246. However, this too, is too little, too late and only offers a peek
into the circumstances of the accused after conviction. The unfortunate
reality is that in the absence of well-documented mitigating
circumstances at the trial level, the aggravating circumstances seem far
more compelling, or overwhelming, rendering the sentencing court
prone to imposing the death penalty, on the basis of an incomplete,
and hence, incorrect application of the Bachan Singh82 test.
247. The goal of reformation is ideal, and what society must strive
towards - there are many references to it peppered in this Court's
jurisprudence across the decades - but what is lacking is a concrete
framework that can measure and evaluate it. Unfortunately, this is
mirrored by the failure to implement prison reforms of a meaningful
kind, which has left the process of incarceration and prisons in general,
to be a space of limited potential for systemic reformation. The goal of
reformative punishment requires systems that actively enable
reformation and rehabilitation, as a result of nuanced policy-making. As
a small step to correct these skewed results and facilitate better
evaluation of whether there is a possibility for the accused to be
reformed (beyond vague references to conduct, family background,
etc.), this Court deems it necessary to frame practical guidelines for the
courts to adopt and implement, till the legislature and executive,
formulate a coherent framework through legislation. These guidelines
may also offer guidance or ideas, that such a legislative framework
could benefit from, to systematically collect and evaluate information
on mitigating circumstances.
Practical guidelines to collect mitigating circumstances
248. There is urgent need to ensure that mitigating circumstances
are considered at the trial stage, to avoid slipping into a retributive
response to
the brutality of the crime, as is noticeably the situation in a majority of
cases reaching the appellate stage.
249. To do this, the trial court must elicit information from the
accused and the State, both. The State, must-for an offence carrying
capital punishment-at the appropriate stage, produce material which
is preferably collected beforehand, before the Sessions Court disclosing
psychiatric and psychological evaluation of the accused. This will help
establish proximity (in terms of timeline), to the accused person's
frame of mind (or mental illness, if any) at the time of committing the
crime and offer guidance on mitigating factors (1), (5), (6) and (7)
spelled out in Bachan Even for the other factors of (3) and (4)
-an onus placed squarely on the State-conducting this form of
psychiatric and psychological evaluation close on the heels of
commission of the offence, will provide a baseline for the appellate
courts to use for comparison i.e. to evaluate the progress of the
accused towards reformation, achieved during the incarceration period.
250. Next, the State, must in a time-bound manner, collect
additional information pertaining to the accused. An illustrative, but not
exhaustive list is as follows:
(a) Age
(b) Early family background (siblings, protection of parents, any
history of violence or neglect)
(c) Present family background (surviving family members,
whether married, has children, etc.)
(d) Type and level of education
(e) Socio-economic background (including conditions of poverty or
deprivation, if any)
(f) Criminal antecedents (details of offence and whether
convicted, sentence served, if any)
(g) Income and the kind of employment (whether none, or
temporary or permanent, etc.);
(h) Other factors such as history of unstable social behaviour, or
mental or psychological ailment(s), alienation of the individual (with
reasons, if any), etc.
This information should mandatorily be available to the trial court, at
the sentencing stage. The accused too, should be given the same
opportunity to produce evidence in rebuttal, towards establishing all
mitigating circumstances.
251. Lastly, information regarding the accused's jail conduct and
behaviour, work done (if any), activities the accused has involved
themselves in, and other related details should be called for in the form
of a report from the relevant jail authorities (i.e. Probation and Welfare
Officer, Superintendent of Jail, etc.). If the appeal is heard after a long
hiatus from the trial court's conviction, or High Court's confirmation, as
the case may be - a
fresh report (rather than the one used by the previous court) from the
jail authorities is recommended, for a more exact and complete
understanding of the contemporaneous progress made by the accused,
in the time elapsed. The jail authorities must also include a fresh
psychiatric and psychological report which will further evidence the
reformative progress, and reveal post-conviction mental illness, if any.
252. It is pertinent to point out that this Court in Anil V. State of
Maharashtra52
has in fact directed criminal courts to call for additional
"33.
Many a times, while determining the sentence, the courts
take it for granted, looking into the facts of a particular case, that
the accused would be a menace to the society and there is no
possibility of reformation and rehabilitation, while it is the duty of
the court to ascertain those factors, and the State is obliged to
furnish materials for and against the possibility of reformation and
rehabilitation of the accused. The facts, which the courts deal with,
in a given case, cannot be the foundation for reaching such a
conclusion, which, as already stated, calls for additional materials.
We, therefore, direct that the criminal courts, while dealing with the
offences like Section 302 IPC, after conviction, may, in appropriate
cases, call for a report to determine, whether the accused could be
reformed or rehabilitated, which depends upon the facts and
circumstances of each case."
(emphasis supplied)
We hereby fully endorse and direct that this should be implemented
uniformly, as further elaborated above, for conviction of offences that
carry the possibility of death sentence.
Sentencing of present accused
253. This Court is of the opinion, that there can be no doubt that the
crime committed by the three accused was brutal, and grotesque. The
three defenceless victims were women of different age groups (22, 46,
76 years) who were caught off-guard and severely physically assaulted,
resulting in their death, in the safety and comfort of their own home. To
have killed three generations of women from the family of PW 1, is
without a doubt, grotesque. The manner of the offence was also vicious
and pitiless - Ashlesha and Rohini, were stabbed repeatedly to their
death, while Megha was shot point blank in the face. The post-mortem
(Ext. P-44) reflects that the stab wounds were extensive - ranging
across the bodies of the victim. The extensive bleeding at the crime
scene further reflects cruel and inhumane manner of attack, against the
three women. The crime in itself, could no doubt be characterised as
"extremely brutal, grotesque, diabolical, revolting or dastardly manner
so as to arouse intense and extreme indignation of the community" as
defined in Machhi Singh91. These are the aggravating circumstances.
82
254. On an application of the Bachan Singh test (as clarified and
explained, in numerous decisions elaborated above), however, the
mitigating circumstances need to be considered (and that too, liberally
and expansively). Prior to the hearing on sentencing before this Court,
a direction was issued to the State to (on the basis of personal
interviews and prison records) file for each of the accused - a
Psychological Evaluation Report, a Probation Officer's Report, and Prison
Report including material on their conduct and work done. Furthermore,
each of the accused has placed material on record before this Court, to
demonstrate circumstances of the criminal.
255. Given that in this case there are three accused - this Court
cannot baldly consider their circumstances collectively, and instead find
that an individualised approach is necessary.
(i) Manoj
256. The material states that Manoj's conduct appears to be
disciplined, correctional in nature and overall satisfactory, barring one
physical altercation during an earlier confinement period. He has a wife
and two young children with whom he has repaired relations and is
regularly in touch with. He makes special effort to be a part of his
growing children's lives, demonstrating strong continued family ties.
While in prison, owing to his interest in cricket, he has also taken up
the responsibility of being the Captain of the Jail Block team. The
Probation Officer concludes that he seems remorseful, and keen to
reintegrate into society with his family.
(ii) Rahul
257. The report received from the Superintendent of Jail indicates
that he too was involved in an altercation with another inmate in his
previous confinement period, but his overall conduct appears to be
normal, and correctional in nature. He has been voluntarily working as a
health worker (based on his request) since 5-1-2021 wherein he helps
transport sick inmates to the Jail Hospital. While in prison, he has
completed 12th standard education, and proceeded to pursue BCom
from IGNOU, New Delhi (in his final year). He actively participates in
cultural and spiritual programmes conducted in the prison. His family
consists of his ailing father, mother, and three married sisters. He
expressed concern for his old parents and wished to help them
financially by rejoining society.
(iii) Neha
258. Her prison record reflects that she had, on a few occasions, got
into fights and exchanged abuses with the other female inmates, and
lady guard officers in the jail. After counselling, however, her conduct
has improved and was found to be disciplined and corrective in nature.
While in prison, she actively participates in cultural programmes, has
undergone training for embroidery, knitting and lamination. In 2017,
she received a national award for Jardosi work in Indore District Court
and has received numerous other
accolades for her participation in activities. In prison, she teaches
children of other female inmates. Before detention, she was pursuing
her BCom degree, which she completed in prison. Her family consists of
her parents and two married brothers (of which one, is paralysed), who
she is regularly in touch with.
Conclusion on sentence of the three accused
259. It is unfortunate to note that both the trial court, and the High
Court, failed to provide an effective sentencing hearing to the accused,
at the relevant stage, which is a right under Section 235(2) CrPC
recognised by this Court in several cases.
109
In fact, it was argued by
the accused that the trial court in contravention of this Court's
judgments110 , had proceeded to hear on sentencing almost
immediately, depriving the accused of the opportunity to put forth their
case for a less stringent sentence. The trial court order on sentencing,
records in passing - the plea of "young age" and "socio-economic
factors" as mitigating circumstances, but reflects, at best, a mechanical
consideration of the same. Swayed by the brutality of the crime and
"shock of the collective and judicial conscience", the High Court
affirmed imposition of the death penalty solely on the basis of the
aggravating circumstances of the crime, with negligible consideration of
mitigating circumstances of the criminal. This is in direct contravention
of Bachan Singh
260. The crime that the appellants have been held guilty of, is
heinous; its execution was vicious and cruel, by any stretch of
imagination. The deception practised by the appellants, in entering the
flat, and, when encountering resistance, attacking the three women,
was calculated and ruthless. The repeated stabbings of two of the
deceased, almost in a frenzy, on the one hand, and the defenceless
state of the victims, on the other, highlights that the accused were
willing to go ahead with their plans (of robbing) after eliminating the
women of three generations. No doubt, two of the victims appear to
have put up resistance, if one looks at the stab wounds inflicted all over
their bodies, including on their arms and faces. Yet, they were unarmed
and weak.
261. At the same time, the young age of the accused at the time of
the incident (35, 20, 22, respectively) and lack of criminal antecedents
(except in the case of Manoj, who was allegedly involved in a case of
petty theft) cannot be lost sight of. Further, the prosecution case is
silent on any real motive that
may have instigated or moved the three accused to have preplanned for
the commission of murder - other than robbery, itself. This coupled
with the fact that Rahul was shot in his leg during the commission of
the crime, indicates that perhaps it is reasonable to assume that they
were amateurs in a robbing-gone-wrong situation, who were not intent
on taking the lives of these three women. One can surmise that having
ventured to rob, perhaps they did not contemplate the kind of
resistance that was put up by the victims, which led them to act the
way they did, to continue with their plan, and ensure that the victims
did not survive to tell the tale.
262. The reports received from the Superintendent of Jail reflect that
each of the three accused, have a record of overall good conduct in
prison and display inclination to reform. It is evident that they have
already, while in prison, taken steps towards bettering their lives and of
those around them, which coupled with their young age111
unequivocally demonstrates that there is in fact, a probability of reform.
On consideration of all the circumstances overall, we find that the
option of life imprisonment is certainly not foreclosed.
2 While there is no doubt that this case captured the attention
and indignation of the society in Indore, and perhaps the State of
Madhya Pradesh, as a cruel crime that raised alarm regarding safety
within the community - it must be remembered that public opinion
has categorically been held to be neither an objective circumstance
relating to crime, nor the criminal, and the courts must exercise judicial
restraint and play a balancing role. 112
264. In view of the totality of facts and circumstances, and for the
abovestated reasons, this Court finds that imposition of death sentence
would be unwarranted in the present case. It would be appropriate and
in the overall interests of justice to commute the death sentence of all
three accused, to life imprisonment for a minimum term of 25 years.
The appeals are partly allowed in the above terms.
