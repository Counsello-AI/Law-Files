GANPATI DEALCOM PRIVATE LIMITED
Respondent.
Civil Appeal No. 5783 of 2022 , decided on August 23, 2022
A. Property Law - Prohibition of Benami Property Transactions Act,
1988 - S. 3 [as it stood in the unamended 1988 Act] - Held,
unconstitutional, being manifestly arbitrary, vague and violative of the
substantive due process requirement of the Constitution
- S. 3 of the unamended 1988 Act criminalised very act of payment of
consideration by one person to seller for acquisition of property for another person
i.e. benamidar (tripartite transaction) but excluded element of mens rea - Absence
of mens rea made the provision harsh envisaging strict liability - Further, absence
of essential ingredient of beneficial ownership of real owner made the provision
more stringent and disproportionate with respect of benami transaction of tripartite
nature without identifying any reason or principle therefor - Operation of S. 3 of
the unamended 1988 Act, if allowed, would also have other deleterious
consequences - Constitution of India, Arts. 14, 19 and 21
B. Property Law - Prohibition of Benami Property Transactions Act,
1988 - S. 5 [as it stood in the unamended 1988 Act] - Held,
unconstitutional
- Adequate safeguards not provided under S. 5 of the unamended 1988 Act -
Instead, essential features left to be prescribed through delegated legislation -
Gaps left by it not merely procedural but essential and substantive Such
delegation of power, held, excessive and manifestly arbitrary and omission of law to
fill the gaps, fanciful and oppressive - Hence unconstitutional - Constitution of
India, Art. 14
C. Property Law - Prohibition of Benami Property Transactions Act,
1988 - S. 4 [as it stood in the unamended 1988 Act] - The said S. 4 and
provisions of the unamended Act other then Ss. 3 and 5 thereof, held, not
affected by the ruling herein declaring the said Ss. 3 and 5 as
constitutionally invalid
D. Property Law - Prohibition of Benami Property Transactions Act,
1988 - Ss. 3 and 53 [as they stand after the 2016 Amendment] - Held,
may only be applied prospectively
- However, S. 3(2) of the 1988 Act as amended in 2016, as it purports
to apply S. 3 of the unamended 1988 Act retroactively, held, is violative of
Art. 20(1) of the Constitution - This is because S. 3 of the unamended
1988 Act, which is a punitive provision, has been held to be unconstitutional
in the present case
- Constitution of India, Art. 20(1)
E. Property Law - Prohibition of Benami Property Transactions Act, 1988
- S. 5 and Ch. IV (Ss. 24 to 29) [as they stand after the 2016
Amendment - Held, said provisions are not merely civil forfeiture
provisions - Rather, held, they are in rem punitive forfeiture provisions
- Thus, held, S. 5 and Ch. IV (Ss. 24 to 29) [as they stand after the
2016 Amendment being punitive in nature, may only be applied
prospectively, as any retroactive applicability of the same would violate Art.
20(1) of the Constitution
- However, question whether S. 5 and Ch. IV (Ss. 24 to 29) [as they
stand after the 2016 Amendment are constitutionally valid, left open, as
the said issue was not in issue before the Court in the present case
- S. 5 and Ch. IV (Ss. 24 to 29) [as they stand after the 2016 Amendment],
held, create a confiscation procedure distinct from that provided under CrPC by
altering substantive rights of evidentiary standards, from beyond reasonable doubt
to
preponderance of probabilities - Presumption of innocence which forms part of
fundamental right also excluded
- Confiscation procedure under S. 5 and Ch. IV (Ss. 24 to 29) [as they stand
after the 2016 Amendment] contemplates in rem forfeiture wherein taint of
entering into benami transaction is created not on individual but on property itself -
Such in rem proceeding contemplates condemnation of method of transfer and
holding of property which was earlier recognised proper in India, and condemnation
of proceeds of sale which may also involve legitimate means of addition of wealth

H. Constitution of India - Pt. III - Constitutionality of Act or some
provision(s) of an Act - When may be examined by Court - Act or its
provision(s) not challenged directly - However, amendment(s) to the
original existing provision(s) in question contended to be clarificatory in
nature, and hence as not being retroactive/retrospective in nature - Held,
in such a case, Court is bound to first determine whether the original
existing provision(s) themselves were constitutionally valid, regardless of
how long they had stood on the statute book, before it can consider
whether the amendment(s) in question were clarificatory in nature or not
I. Constitution of India - Art. 20(1) - Bar on retrospective/retroactive
punitive laws under - Whether violated by amendment(s) to existing
punitive provision(s) of law - Contention that amendment(s) to punitive
provision(s) of law in question being only clarificatory in nature, the
amendment(s) did not amount to retroactive/retrospective punitive laws -
Examination of constitutionality of the existing punitive provision(s) of law
in such a case - Necessity of
- Held, in such a case, Court is bound to first determine whether the
original existing punitive provision(s) themselves were constitutionally valid,
regardless of how long they had stood on the statute book, before it can
consider whether the amendment(s) in question were clarificatory in nature
or not, so as to determine whether the amendment(s) in question violated
the bar under Art. 20(1)
J. Constitution of India - Pt. III - Presumption of constitutionality -
Limits of - Answer to questions of legality and constitutionality of
provisions, held, cannot be assumed in favour of constitutionality simply
because the same were never questioned before the Court

unconstitutional - Effect - Prospective overruling or prospective
declaration of law - When Court can resort to - Explained
- When a Court declares a law as unconstitutional, the effect of the same is
that such a declaration would render the law not to exist in the law books since its
inception - It is only a limited exception under constitutional law, or when
substantial actions have been undertaken under such unconstitutional laws, that
going back to the original position would be next to impossible - In those cases
alone, would the Court take recourse to the concept of prospective overruling or
prospective declaration of law

"Benami property"
(Paras 14 to 32)
Held :
The term "benami transaction" generally implies that one purchases the property
in the name of somebody else i.e. a name lender, and the purchaser does not hold
beneficial interest in the property. Literally, "benami" means "without a name".
(Para 14)
McNaughten's Selected Report, Vol. I, Reporter's Note at p. 368, referred to
Eventually, there developed two loose categories of transactions that were
colloquially termed as benami, which can be explained through the following
examples : Tripartite : B sells a property to A (real owner), but the sale deed
mentions C as the owner/benamidar. And bipartite : A sells property to B without
intending to pass the title to B. The first instance was usually termed as a real
benami transaction, and the second transaction was considered either as a sham
transaction or "loosely" benami transaction. Numerous reasons, some desirable
and some undesirable, were contributory factors for the proliferation of such
practice in India. The judiciary came to establish the general principle that in law, the
real owner is recognised over the ostensible owner. This principle had certain
statutory exceptions, albeit limited, such as Section 66 CPC, and Section 281-A of
the Income Tax Act, 1961. The Trusts Act, 1882 has also recognised and accepted
the principle behind benami transactions. The first category of transactions is
"usually" termed as benami, while the second category is "occasionally" considered
a benami transaction.

The main thrust of the Union of India in this appeal is that the 2016 Amendment
only clarifies the unamended 1988 Act. That is to say, according to the Union of
India, the unamended 1988 Act had already created substantial law for criminalising
the offence and the 2016 Amendments were merely clarificatory and procedural, to
give effect to the 1988 Act. Such a submission mandates the Court to examine the
law of the 1988 Act in detail and determine the scope of the earlier regime to
understand as to whether the 2016 Amendments were substantive or procedural.
(Para 38)
Reading Section 2(a) of the unamended 1988 Act along with Section 3 of the
unamended 1988 Act makes it clear that the criminal provision envisaged under the
aforesaid provisions does not expressly contemplate mens rea. It completely
ignores the aspect of mens rea, as it intends to criminalise the very act of one
person paying consideration for acquisition of property for another person. Section
3 of the unamended 1988 Act created a strict liability offence.
(Paras 39 to 44)
Mens rea is an essential ingredient of a criminal offence. Doubtless, a statute
may exclude the element of mens rea, but it is a sound rule of construction
adopted in England-and also accepted in India-to construe a statutory provision
creating an offence in conformity with common law rather than against it, unless
the statute expressly or by necessary implication excluded mens rea. The mere fact
that the object of the statute is to promote welfare activities or to eradicate a
grave social evil which bv itself is not decisive of the question as to whether the
element of a guilty mind is excluded from the ingredients of an offence. Mens rea by
necessary implication may be excluded from a statute only where it is absolutely
clear that implementation of the object of the statute would otherwise be defeated.
(Para 39)
Nathulal V. State of M.P., AIR 1966 SC 43, relied on
There is no doubt that the unamended 1988 Act tried to create a strict liability
offence and allowed separate acquisition of benami property. This begs the question
whether such a criminal provision, which the State now intends to make use of, in
order to confiscate properties after 28 years of dormancy, could have existed in
the books of law. Other than the abuse and unfairness such exercise intends to
bring about, there is a larger constitutional question about existence of such strict
provisions without adequate safeguards.
(Para 44)
There are questions of legality and constitutionality which arise with respect to
Sections 3 and 5 of the unamended 1988 Act. The answers to such questions
cannot be assumed in favour of constitutionality, simply because the same was
never questioned before the court of law. Instead of speaking of presumption of
constitutionality as a matter of burden of proof, here it is indicated that the Union
has taken assumption as to the validity of these provisions. Such assumption
cannot be made when the Court is called upon to answer whether the impugned
provisions are attracted to those transactions that have taken place before 2016.
(Para 46)
The criminal provision under Section 3 of the unamended 1988 Act has serious
lacunae which could not have been cured by judicial forums, even through some
form of harmonious interpretation. A conclusion contrary to the above would make
the aforesaid law suspect to being overly oppressive, fanciful and manifestly
arbitrary, thereby violating the "substantive due process" requirement of the
Constitution. Thus, it is held that Section 3 of the unamended 1988 Act is vague
and arbitrary. It created an unduly harsh law against settled principles and the Law
Commission recommendations. Section 3 of the unamended 1988 Act is declared
as unconstitutional for being manifestly arbitrary.
(Paras 56 to 62, 87.1, 87.2 and 127.1)
Section 5 of the unamended 1988 Act is regarding acquisition of benami
property. However this provision was never utilised as it was felt that there was
requirement of additional statutory backing to make the law effective. The
acquisition proceedings contemplated under the earlier Act were in rem proceedings
against benami property. Jurisprudentially, such in rem proceedings transfer the guilt
from the person who utilised a property which is a general harm to the society, to
the property itself.
(Paras 35 and 63)
When such proceedings are contemplated under the law, there need to be
adequate safeguards built into the provisions, without which the law would be
susceptible to challenge under Article 14 of the Constitution. Section 5 of the
unamended 1988 Act was conceived as a half-baked provision which did not
provide the following and rather left the same to be prescribed through a delegated
legislation:
(i) Whether the proceedings under Section 5 of the unamended 1988 Act
were independent or dependent on successful prosecution?
(ii) The standard of proof required to establish benami transaction in terms of
Section 5.
(iii) Mechanism for providing opportunity for a person to establish his
defence.
(iv) No "defence of innocent owner" was provided to save legitimate
innocent buyers.
(v) No adjudicatory mechanism was provided for.
(vi) No provision was included to determine vesting of acquired property.
(vii) No provision to identify or trace benami properties.
(viii) Condemnation of property cannot include the power of tracing, which
needs an express provision.
Such delegation of power to the authority under Section 5 of the unamended 1988
Act was squarely excessive and arbitrary as it stood. From the aforesaid, the
Union's stand that the 2016 Act was merely procedural, cannot stand scrutiny.
(para 64)
In any case, such an inconclusive law, such as Section 5 of the unamended
1988 Act, which left the essential features to be prescribed through delegation, can
never be countenanced in law to be valid under Part III of the Constitution. The
gaps left in the unamended 1988 Act were not merely procedural, rather the same
were essential and substantive. In the absence of such substantive provisions, the
omissions create a law which is fanciful and oppressive at the same time. Such an
overbroad provision was manifestly arbitrary as the open texture of the law did not
have sufficient safeguards to be proportionate.
(Paras 65 and 87.3)
When a Court declares a law as unconstitutional, the effect of the same is that
such a declaration would render the law not to exist in the law books since its
inception. It is only a limited exception under constitutional law, or when substantial
actions have been undertaken under such unconstitutional laws that going back to
the original position would be next to impossible. In those cases alone, would the
Court take recourse to the concept of "prospective overruling".
(Para 66)
Thus, it is held that Section 3 (criminal provision) read with Section 2(a) of the
unamended 1988 Act and Section 5 (confiscation proceedings) of the unamended
1988 Act are overly broad, disproportionately harsh, and operate without adequate
safeguards in place. Such provisions were stillborn law and never utilised in the first
place. In rem forfeiture provision under Section 5 of the unamended 1988 Act, prior
to the 2016 Amendment Act, was unconstitutional for being manifestly arbitrary.
Thus, it is held that Sections 3 and 5 of the 1988 Act were unconstitutional from
their inception.
(Paras 67 and 127.2)
The simple question addressed by the counsel appearing for both sides is
whether the amended 2016 Act is retroactive or prospective. Answering the above
question is inevitably tied to an intermediate question as to whether the 1988 Act
was constitutional in the first place. The arguments addressed by the Union of India
hinge on the fact that the 1988 Act was a valid substantive law, which required only
some gap filling through the 2016 Act, to ensure that sufficient procedural
safeguards and mechanisms are present to enforce the law. According to the Union
of India, the 2016 Act was a mere gap-filling exercise.
(Para 45)
However, upon studying the provisions of the 1988 Act, it is found that there
are questions of legality and constitutionality which arise with respect to Sections 3
and 5 of the 1988 Act. The answers to such questions cannot be assumed in
favour of constitutionality, simply because the same was never questioned before
the court of law. It is clarified that the above observations are not in respect of the
presumption of constitutionality as a matter of burden of proof. Rather, what is
being addressed is the assumption taken by the Union of India as to the validity of
these provisions in the present litigation. Such assumption cannot be made when
the Court is called upon to answer whether the impugned provisions are attracted
to those transactions that have taken place before 2016.
(Para 46)
It has been found herein that Section 3(1) of the unamended 1988 Act is vague
and arbitrary. Section 3(1) of the unamended 1988 Act created an unduly harsh
law against settled principles and the Law Commission recommendations. Section 5
of the unamended 1988 Act, the provision relating to civil forfeiture, was manifestly
arbitrary. Both provisions were unworkable and as a matter of fact, were never
implemented. Having arrived at these conclusions that Sections 3 and 5 were
unconstitutional under the unamended 1988 Act, it would mean that the 2016
Amendments were, in effect, creating new provisions and new offences. Therefore,
there was no question of retroactive application of the 2016 Act. Thus, so far as
Sections 3 and 5 of the unamended 1988 Act are concerned, for those transactions
that were entered into between 5-9-1988 to 25-10-2016, the law cannot
retroactively invigorate a stillborn criminal offence, as established above.
(Paras 87 and 88)
However, it is made abundantly clear that the above discussion does not affect
the civil consequences contemplated under Section 4 of the unamended 1988 Act,
or any other provisions thereof.
(Para 68)
As per the concession made by the Union of India and a fair reading of Section
53 of the 1988 Act as inserted in 2016, the offence under the aforesaid provision is
prospective, and only applied to those transactions that were entered into after the
Amendment came into force viz. 25-10-2016. In the case at hand, the 1988 Act
as amended in 2016 containing the criminal provisions is applicable only
prospectively, as the relevant sections of the pre-Amendment 1988 Act containing
the penal provision, have been declared as unconstitutional. Sections 3 and 5 of the
unamended 1988 Act were unconstitutional from their inception. The continued
presence of an unconstitutional law on the statute book, or the claim that such law
was not challenged before constitutional courts, does not prevent the Supreme
Court from holding that such unconstitutional laws cannot enure to the benefit of or
be utilised to retroactively amend laws to cure existing constitutional defects. If
such curing is allowed, then Article 20(1) of the Constitution would be rendered
nugatory. The question of construction of the 2016 Act as retroactive qua the penal
provisions under Sections 3 or 53, does not arise.
(Paras 89, 91, 67 and 92)
Calder V. Bull, 1 L Ed 648 : 3 Dall 386 : 3 US 386 (1798), cited
Craies on Statute Law, 7th Edn., at pp. 388-89, referred to
Although it has been held that Section 5 of the unamended 1988 Act was
unconstitutional for being manifestly arbitrary, however such holding is of no
consequence if the Supreme Court comes to the conclusion that confiscation under
Section 5 of the 1988 Act as amended in 2016 read with Chapter IV (Sections 24
to 29) thereof, was civil in nature and is not punitive. The legislature has power to
enact (retroactive/retrospective civil legislations under the Constitution. But a
punitive provision cannot be couched as a civil provision to bypass the mandate
under Article 20(1) of the Constitution which follows the settled legal principle that
"what cannot be done directly, cannot be done indirectly". Therefore, the immediate
question which arises for consideration is whether the retroactive confiscation
provided under Section 5 of the 1988 Act as amended in 2016 read with Chapter IV
as inserted in 2016 is punitive or not?
(Paras 94 to 96)
Under Admiralty jurisdiction, the Admiralty Courts concerned had the jurisdiction
to forfeit vessels under its civil jurisdiction in lieu of any maritime claim. Same was
the law across various common law jurisdictions, such as the United States of
America and the United Kingdom.
(Para 99)
Forfeiture occurs in various types, a few of which are found in India. Broadly,
forfeitures can be categorised as civil and criminal. On the civil side, there can be in
rem or in personam forfeitures. Punitive forfeitures under the criminal law are in
personam. Criminal forfeitures usually take place at the conclusion of a trial, when
the guilt of the accused is established. Standards of evidentiary requirement differ
greatly between civil and criminal forfeitures.
(Para 100)
The historic origin of in rem civil forfeiture in common law jurisdictions was
earlier mostly restricted to transnational crimes. These early laws mandated that
the property was subject to forfeiture because it was the instrument by which the
offence was committed, and it was necessary to confiscate such property to
remove it from circulation. However, the Twentieth Century saw expansion of
forfeiture laws into a wide array of crimes. The modern forfeiture laws not only
allow forfeiture of property used to facilitate the crime, but cover the proceeds of
the offence as well.
(Para 101)
Cases from EU Law and the US Supreme Court lay down tests for determining
whether the forfeiture provision is civil in nature or punitive and criminal in nature. In
India, it is manifest that the Supreme Court has read down the provisions of civil
forfeiture in a number of statutes to be dependent on the underlying criminal
prosecution to temper the harsh consequences envisaged under such provisions.
No doubt, such reading down was mandated to ameliorate harsh consequences of
confiscatory laws which otherwise would have allowed the State agencies to take
over the property without seriously pursuing the criminal prosecutions.
(Paras 102 to 114)
At this stage, it can only be recommended that the utility of independent
provisions of forfeiture, distinct from criminal prosecution, needs to be utilised in a
proportional manner, looking at the gravity of the offence. A few examples which
may pass the muster of proportionality for having such stringent civil forfeiture,
may relate to crimes involving terrorist activities, drug cartels or organised criminal
activities. As discussed, the application of such a provision to numerous other
offences which are not of such grave severity, would be of serious risk of being
disproportionate, if procedures independent of criminal prosecution are prescribed.

Standing Committee on Finance 2015-2016, 16th Lok Sabha, Ministry of Finance
(Deptt. of Revenue). The Benami Transactions Prohibition (Amendment) Bill,
2015, 28th Report, Part I; Oliver Wendell Holmes in The Common Law 5 (1881),
referred to
Under IPC, forfeiture is recommended to be a form of punishment under Section
53. Accordingly, the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 provides for a mechanism
for interim custody and forfeiture at the conclusion of trial under Section 451 CrPC
(in personam forfeiture). Section 452 CrPC is regarding order for disposal of
property at conclusion of trial. The aforesaid provisions under the CrPC have inbuilt
safeguards of in personam criminal forfeiture, wherein
confiscation occurs at the end of the trial. Under these provisions, confiscation is to
be determined at an evidential standard of "beyond reasonable doubt" and are
dependent on the result of the criminal trial.
(Para 115)
Coming to the Benami Act post the amendment, the interplay of Sections 27
(3), (5) and 67 of the 1988 Act as inserted in 2016, creates a confiscation
procedure which is distinct from the procedure contemplated under the CrPC or any
other enactment till now in India. This separation of the confiscation mechanism is
not merely procedural. It has also altered substantive rights of the evidentiary
standards from "beyond reasonable doubt" to "preponderance of probabilities".
Such a change of standards cannot be merely termed as procedural.
(Para 116)
Characterisation of the confiscation proceedings under Chapter IV of the 1988
Act as inserted in 2016 as civil may therefore not be appropriate. There is an
implicit recognition of the forfeiture being a punitive sanction, as the officer is
mandated to build a case against the accused for such confiscation, wherein the
presumption of innocence is upheld structurally. Being a punitive provision, it is trite
that one integrates the "presumption of innocence" within the Chapter as the same
forms a part of the fundamental right.
(Para 117)
affirmed
Additionally, the 1988 Act as amended in 2016 now condemns not only those
transactions which were traditionally denominated as benami, rather a new class of
fictitious and sham transactions are also covered under the same. In this regard, it
may be noticed that the intention of the legislature is to condemn such property
and there is an implicit effort by Parliament to take into consideration the fact that
such transactions are often acquired from ill-gotten wealth. These proceedings
cannot be equated as enforcing civil obligations as, for example, correcting
deficiencies in the title. It goes further and the taint attaches to the proceeds as
well.
(Para 118)
The 1988 Act as amended in 2016 contemplates an in rem forfeiture, wherein
the taint of entering into such a benami transaction is transposed to the asset itself
and the same becomes liable to confiscation. The taint of benami transactions is
not restricted to the person who is entering into the aforesaid transaction, rather, it
attaches itself to the property perpetually and extends itself to all proceeds arising
from such a property, unless the defence of innocent ownership is established under
Section 27(2) of the 1988 Act as inserted in 2016. When such a taint is being
created not on the individual, but on the property itself, a retroactive law would
characterise itself as punitive for condemning the proceeds of sale which may also
involve legitimate means of addition of wealth. The substantive difference between
the acquisition provision under the unamended 1988 Act and the confiscation
provision under the 1988 Act as amended in 2016 is that proceeds of benami
transactions have been made traceable under the 1988 Act as amended in 2016.
(Paras 119 and 98)
Jurisprudentially, a law may enable forfeiture of property by peculiar reason of its
circumstances, of it being dangerous to the community by reasons of any form or
position that it assumes. In such cases, forfeiture is not deemed to be punishment
inflicted on its owner. In this case, the property may not be inherently dangerous or
denigrate any standard of morality. It is just the condemnation of the method of
transfer and holding, which was once a recognised form of property holding in India.
In such a case, the in rem civil proceeding utilised retroactively, would characterise
itself as penal. In rem forfeiture provision under Section 5 of the 1988 Act as
amended in 2016, being punitive in nature, can only be applied prospectively and
not retroactively.
(Paras 120 and 127.4)
The authority that initiates such confiscation under Section 5 read with Chapter
IV of the 1988 Act as amended in 2016, is granted extensive powers of discovery,
inspection, compelling attendance, compelling production of documents. They are
further empowered to take the assistance of Police Officers, Customs Officers,
Income Tax Officers and other relevant officers for furnishing information. Any
person who fails to furnish information, is subjected to a penalty of Rs 25,000
(Rupees twenty-five thousand) under Section 54-A. A person who supplies false
information before any authority, is subjected to rigorous imprisonment of up to 5
years under Section 54 of the 1988 Act as inserted in 2016.

In the present case, the Court is not concerned with the constitutionality of the
confiscation provisions under the 1988 Act as amended in 2016. Rather, the focus
is only on the characterisation of retroactive confiscation, which in these facts and
circumstances, is punitive.
(Para 122)
In view of the fact that it has already been held hereinabove that the criminal
provisions under the unamended 1988 Act were arbitrary and incapable of
application, the law through the 2016 Amendment could not retroactively apply for
confiscation of those transactions entered into between 5-9-1988 to 25-10-2016
as the same would tantamount to punitive punishment, in the absence of any other
form of punishment. It is in this unique circumstance that confiscation, even under
Section 5 read with Chapter IV of the 1988 Act as amended in 2016, contemplated
for the period between 5-9-1988 and 25-10-2016 would characterise itself as
punitive, if such confiscation is allowed retroactively.
(Para 123)
Benami transactions were an accepted form of holding in our country. In fact,
the Privy Council had, at one point of time, praised the sui generis evolution of the
doctrine of trust in the Indian law. The response by the Government and the Law
Commission to curb benami transactions was also not sufficient as it was conceded
before the Supreme Court that Sections 3 and 5 of the unamended 1988 Act in
reality, dehors the legality, remained only on paper and were never implemented on
ground. Any attempt by the legislature to impose such restrictions retroactively
would no doubt be susceptible to prohibitions under Article 20(1) of the
Constitution.

Looked at from a different angle, continuation of only the civil provisions under
Section 4 of the unamended 1988 Act, etc. would mean that the legislative
intention was to ensure that the ostensible owner would continue to have full
ownership over the property, without allowing the real owner to interfere with the
rights of benamidar. If that be the case, then without any effective enforcement
proceedings for a long span of time, the rights that have crystallised since 1988,
would be in jeopardy. Such implied intrusion into the right to property cannot be
permitted to operate retroactively, as that would be unduly harsh and arbitrary.
(Para 126)
Thus, it is held that the authorities concerned cannot initiate or continue criminal
prosecution or confiscation proceedings for transactions entered into prior to the
coming into force of the 2016 Act viz. 25-10-2016. As a consequence of
the above declaration, all such prosecutions or confiscation proceedings shall stand
quashed.
(Para 127.5)
It must be noted that the proportionality of separate confiscation procedure
prescribed under the 1988 Act as amended in 2016, has not been argued herein.
Accordingly, the aforesaid question of law is left open.

challenged - Principles summarised
O. Constitution of India - Art. 14 - Manifest arbitrariness - Concept of

arbitrariness"
Held :
Indian jurisprudence has matured through years of judicial tempering, and the
country has grown to be a jurisdiction having "substantive due process". The term
"Procedure established by law" was interpreted to mean "Procedural due process".
248, wherein a combined reading of Articles 14, 19 and 21 would make it clear that
the judiciary, so to say, always had the forensic power to examine reasonability of
a law, both procedural as well as substantive. Later expositions have only given
colour to expand what was implicit under the three golden Articles of Part III.
(Paras 46 to 52)
A person cannot be deprived of life or personal liberty except in accordance with
the procedure established by law. Article 14, as a guarantee against arbitrariness,
infuses the entirety of Article 21. The interrelationship between the guarantee
against arbitrariness and the protection of life and personal liberty operates in a
multi-faceted plane. First, it ensures that the procedure for deprivation must be fair,
just and reasonable. Second, Article 14 impacts both the procedure and the
expression "law". A law within the meaning of Article 21 must be consistent with
the norms of fairness which originate in Article 14. As a matter of principle, once
Article 14 has a connect with Article 21, norms of fairness and reasonableness
would apply not only to the procedure but to substantive law as well.
(Para 51)
The law with respect to testing the unconstitutionality of a statutory instrument
can be summarised as under:
(i) Constitutional courts can test constitutionality of legislative instruments
(statute and delegated legislations).
(ii) The courts are empowered to test both on procedure as well as
substantive nature of these instruments.
(iii) The test should be based on a combined reading of Articles 14, 19 and
21 of the Constitution.
(para 52)
One of the offshoots of this test under Part III of the Constitution is the
development of the doctrine of manifest arbitrariness. The development of
jurisprudence has come full circle from an overly formalistic test of classification to
include the test of manifest arbitrariness. The test of manifest arbitrariness would
apply to invalidate legislation as well as subordinate legislation under Article 14. A
legislation is "manifestly arbitrary" i.e. when it is not fair, not reasonable,
discriminatory, not transparent, capricious, biased, with favouritism or nepotism
and not in pursuit of promotion of healthy competition and equitable treatment.
Positively speaking, it should conform to norms which are rational, informed with
reason and guided by public interest, etc. Manifest arbitrariness must be something
done by the legislature capriciously, irrationally and/or without adequate
determining principle. Also, when something is done which is excessive and
disproportionate, such legislation would be manifestly arbitrary.

1988 Act as amended in 2016 - Held, the civil consequences provided under S. 4
continue to apply even post the 2016 Amendment - The interpretation of S. 4, as
Held :
Major changes envisaged under the definition of "benami transaction" as
contained in Section 2(9) of the 1988 Act as amended in 2016, are as under:
(i) Expansion of the definition from arm's length transactions contemplated
under the 1988 Act, to arrangements and schemes.
(ii) Additional ingredient of benefits flowing to the real owner, a lacuna
pointed in the earlier part, under the 1988 Act, is included in terms of Section 2
(9)(A)(b).
(iii) Expansion of the ambit through Section 2(9)(C), to those properties
where benamidar denies knowledge of such ownership.
(iv) Expansion of the ambit through Section 2(9)(D), wherein the person
providing the consideration is not traceable or is fictitious.
(v) Expansion from recognition of only tripartite transactions under the 1988
Act, to also include bipartite transactions.
(para 70)
Section 2(26) of the 1988 Act as amended in 2016 defines "property". This
definition has been expanded to include proceeds from the property as well. Such
expansion allows for tracing of proceeds and is a substantial change as compared
to the unamended 1988 Act. Along with this, "benami property" has been defined
under Section 2(8). "Benamidar" is defined under Section 2(10). The substantive
difference between the acquisition provision under the unamended 1988 Act and
the confiscation provision under the 1988 Act as amended in 2016, is that
proceeds of benami transactions have been made traceable under the 1988 Act as
amended in 2016.
(Paras 71 and 98)
Section 3 of the 1988 Act as amended in 2016 now bifurcates offences into two
separate categories based on the time period of the benami transaction. Under
Section 3(2) of the 1988 Act as amended in 2016, punishment of three years is
mandated for those who have entered into benami transactions from 5-9-1988 to
25-10-2016. Section 3(3) of the 1988 Act as amended in 2016 applies to those
benami transactions which have been entered into after commencement of the
1988 Act as amended in 2016 and the punishment for the aforesaid is prescribed
under Section 53 of Chapter VII of the 1988 Act as amended in 2016. It may be
noted that under Section 3(3) of the 1988 Act as amended in 2016, the
punishment is increased from three years to a maximum of seven years and a fine
may be imposed which extends up to 25% of the fair market value of the property.
This distinction between Sections 3(2) and 3(3) read with Section 53 of the 1988
Act as amended in 2016, contains the element of mens rea. A crime which
attracted strict liability under the unamended 1988 Act, is modified vide the 2016
Amendment to include a mens rea aspect in terms of the recommendations of the
57th and 130th Law Commission Reports.
(Paras 72 and 83)
Section 4 of the 1988 Act as amended in 2016 remains the same as under the
unamended 1988 Act, barring the fact that Section 4(3) has integrated the
exceptions provided under the definition of "benami transaction" in terms of Section
2(9) of the 1988 Act as amended in 2016. The civil consequences
provided under Section 4 continue to apply even post the 2016 Amendment. The
interpretation of the aforesaid section, as given in R. Rajagopal Reddy, (1995) 2

The Judgment of the Court was delivered by
N.V. RAMANA, C.J. Leave granted. This case involves a tussle
between the normative and positivist positions regarding the nature of
a crime and punishment. Treating the Constitution as a flagpost, a
result of this tussle is sought in the following deliberation.
2. This appeal is filed against the impugned judgment dated 12-12-
2019 passed by the High Court of Judicature at Calcutta in Ganpati
Dealcom (P) Ltd. V. Union of India¹.
3. The short legal question which arises for this Court's consideration
is whether the Prohibition of Benami Property Transactions Act, 1988
(for short "the 1988 Act"), as amended by the Benami Transactions
(Prohibition) Amendment Act, 2016 (for short "the 2016 Act") has a
prospective effect. Although a purely legal question arises in this
appeal, it is necessary to have a brief factual background in mind
before we advert to the analysis.
4. On 2-5-2011, the respondent Company purchased a property in
its name from various sellers for a total consideration of Rs
9,44,00,000. It is said that the consideration for the aforesaid purchase
was paid from the capital of the company. On 31-3-2012, 99.9% of the
respondent Company shareholdings were acquired by M/s PLD
Properties Pvt. Ltd. and M/s Ginger Marketing Pvt. Ltd. at a discounted
price of Rs 5 per share for a total amount of Rs 19,10,000. It is a
matter of fact that the two Directors of the respondent Company (viz.
Shruti Goenka and Ritu Goenka) also held directorship in the
subsequent purchaser company.
5. Accordingly, on 29-8-2017, the Deputy Commissioner of Income
Tax (adjudicating authority) issued a notice to the respondent Company
invoking Section 24(1) of the 2016 Act to show cause as to why the
aforesaid property should not be considered as benami property and
the respondent Company as benamidar within the meaning of Section 2
(8) of the 2016 Act. On 6-9-2017, the respondent Company replied to
the aforesaid show-cause notice denying that the scheduled property is
a benami property.
6. The adjudicating authority, by order dated 24-11-2017, passed an
order under Section 24(4)(b)(i) of the 2016 Act, provisionally attaching
the property.
7. Aggrieved by the aforesaid attachment order, the respondent
Company filed a writ petition (being WP No. 687 of 2017) before the
High Court of Calcutta. The aforesaid writ petition was disposed of by
the learned Single Judge by an order dated 18-12-2018 2 with
a
direction to the adjudicating authority to conclude the proceedings
within 12 weeks.
8. Aggrieved, the respondent Company filed an appeal against the
aforesaid order being APO No. 8 of 2019.
9. The High Court, vide the impugned order dated 12-12-2019
while quashing the show-cause notice dated 29-8-2017, held that the
2016 Act does not have retrospective application:
9.1. The 2016 Amendment Act, which came into force on 1-11-
2016, was a new and substantive legislation, inter alia, substituting
and widening the definition of "benami property and benami
transaction", and in order to have retrospective operation for the period
or transactions entered into prior to 1-11-2016, a provision to that
effect should have been specifically providing under the said Act; in the
absence of any express provision to that effect, simply by virtue of the
provisions contained in sub-section (3) of Section 1 of the 1988 Act
[which remained unaltered by the 2016 Amendment Act, and have
consequently been retained under the Benami Act], the provisions of
the 2016 Amendment Act cannot be impliedly construed as
retrospective.
9.2. Reference was made to and reliance was placed on the
unreported ruling of the learned Single Judge of the Rajasthan High
Court dated 12-7-2019 in Niharika Jain V. Union of India ³ , wherein,
following the ruling of the Single Judge of the Hon'ble Bombay High
Court in Joseph Isharat V. Rozy Nishikant Gaikwad4 5 , it was held that
in terms of the protection enshrined under clause (1) of Article 20 of
the Constitution of India, the 2016 Amendment Act, amending, inter
alia, the definition of "benami transaction", could not be given
retrospective effect, and the amendments brought about vide the said
(Amendment) Act would be enforceable only with effect from the date
of the enactment/coming into force of the said Amendment Act i.e. on
or after 1-11-2016 - reliance in this regard was also placed on the
ruling of this Court in Rao Shiv Bahadur Singh V. State of Vindhya
Pradesh6.
9.3. The 1988 Act, which came into force on 19-5-1988 [except
Sections 3, 5 and 8 thereof which came into force on 5-9-1988],
provided for punishment for persons entering into a "benami
transaction", which was made non-cognizable and bailable, and also
however, provided for acquisition of property held to be benami;
provisions of the 1988 Act, were never operationalised since the rules
and procedure required to be framed under Section 8 of the said Act
bringing into existence the machinery for implementation of the 1988
Act, were never notified - therefore, although the 1988 Act was part of
the statute book, the same was rendered a "dead letter", and all
transactions and properties alleged "benami", carried out/acquired
between the period of 19-5-1988 and 1-11-2016, were deemed to have
been accepted by the Government as valid "vesting rights" in the
parties to such alleged transactions; ergo, the Central Government,
having waived its right of implementation and operationalisation of the
1988 Act for the period prior to 1-11-2016, cannot now do so indirectly
by way of retrospective operation of the 2016 Amendment Act.
10. Aggrieved by the aforesaid impugned order1, the Union of India
is in appeal before this Court.
Submissions
11. Shri S.V. Raju, learned Additional Solicitor General ("ASG") has
contended as under:
11.1. As per the pre-Amendment Act, there was no machinery or
procedure in place to effectuate proceedings against benami
transactions. It is submitted that in order to remedy this mischief of
lack of procedure, the Amendment Act, which was a consolidating Act,
was brought in.
11.2. It was not an offence that is sought to be implemented
retrospectively, but merely the procedures are laid down to implement
the 1988 Act. He stated that the pre-Amendment Act already
recognises benami transactions as contrary to law, and hence no new or
substantive law is being made.
11.3. It is settled law that procedural law can be applied
retrospectively, and the bar against retrospective application is only
applicable to substantive law.
11.4. The legislative intent for bringing an amendment to the
existing Act, and not enacting a new law, was to ensure that no
immunity is granted to persons who engaged in benami transactions
while the pre-Amendment Act was in operation.
11.5. It was further submitted that Section 5 and Section 27 of the
Act are to be read together as the latter provides the mechanism
through which the benami property may be confiscated by the
adjudicating authority. As per Section 27(3), once the confiscation
order is passed by the authority, the rights in the property are vested in
the Central Government. It was reiterated that confiscation is not a
penal provision, as the same has civil consequences. Both, acquisition
and confiscation are civil in nature, and therefore, they can be used
interchangeably. Therefore, any Amendment Act which is consolidating
in nature, can have provisions which are confiscatory in nature and the
same can be applied retrospectively. For this, the learned ASG referred
submitted that in this judgment, this Court has held that confiscation is
not a punishment, and that Article 20(1) is not attracted. The Court
also held that confiscation as imposed by the adjudicating authority
would not amount to any punishment, and is only a deprivation of the
property of the person in question.
11.6. The learned ASG also referred to Mithilesh Kumari V. Prem
the machinery and procedural provisions of the amended Act are
retrospective in nature.
12. Shri Vikramjit Banerjee, learned ASG has submitted as under:
12.1. Parliament has the power to enact retrospective legislation
even in case of a criminal statute, as long as it complies with Article 20
(1) of the Constitution of India. He further argued that as per Article 20
(1), prohibition exists only on conviction and sentencing of the ex post
facto law, and not against passing such a law.
12.2. Forfeiture, acquisition, and confiscation are not punishments
and therefore not subject to Article 20(1) restrictions. He then pointed
out that the adjudication proceedings are also not in the nature of
prosecution, and hence cannot be restricted by Article 20.
12.3. That acquisition of property without paying compensation
amounts to confiscation, and confiscation envisages a civil liability.
13. Dr Abhishek Manu Singhvi, learned Senior Advocate appearing
for the respondent has contended as under:
13.1. The 1988 Act did not make its provisions applied
retrospectively. Parliament purposely ensured that when the 1988
Ordinance was replaced by the parent Act, only the provisions from the
1988 Ordinance were continued from the date of the promulgation of
the Ordinance. The other provisions introduced by the parent Act,
namely, Sections 3, 5 and 8, were made only prospectively applicable
from the date on which the parent Act was brought into effect.
13.2. The 2016 Act was not intended to be retrospectively applicable
as the same is not explicitly stated. Parliament deemed it fit to leave it
to the Central Government to enforce the 2016 Act from an appointed
date by notifying it in the Official Gazette, as mentioned in Section 1(2)
of the 2016 Act.
13.3. It was further argued that when the statute carves out distinct
penalties in respect of benami transactions entered into in the
unamended regime vis-à-vis the benami transactions entered into after
the Amendment Act of 2016, it clearly indicates that the amended Act
is prospective in nature.
13.4. The learned Senior Advocate also relied on R. Rajagopal Reddy
V. Padmini Chandrasekharan and Mangathai Ammal V. Rajeswari10, in
the context of Sections 4(1), 4(2) and 3(2) of the parent Act, to
contend that the abovementioned provisions are prospective in nature.
13.5. It is also argued that insertion of Section 2(9) by an
amendment to the parent Act provides a new definition to benami
transactions and has substantially changed the scope of the offence by
enlarging its ambit. In the unamended Act, only transfer of property
was an offence. However, the 2016 Act has added multiple other
actions as offences under the category of benami transactions. It is a
well-settled principle of law that any enactment which substantially
affects the rights of people cannot be applied retrospectively, and
therefore, the amended 2016 Act can only be prospective in nature. For
11
this, the judgment of this Court in CIT V. Vatika Township (P) Ltd.
was relied on.
Introduction to practice of properties held benami in India
14. Having heard the parties, it is necessary for this Court to trace
the history of benami transactions in India. The term "benami
transaction" generally implies that one purchases the property in the
name of somebody else i.e. a name lender, and the purchaser does not
hold beneficial interest in the property. Literally, "benami" means
"without a name". The simplest of example is if person A (real owner)
purchases a property from B in the name of C (benamidar/ostensible
owner), wherein A exercise rights/interest over the property.
15. The term "benami", which was alien to statutory law during the
Colonial regime and in the early days of the Republic, was known in the
legal parlance of lawyers. Even in Mohammedan law, such transactions
were commonly referred as furzee or farzi, derived from Arabic word
furaz. Over the passage of time, this nebulous concept appeared in
12
cases without much clarity with respect to its basic contours.
Conceptually, there are two views which arise from the doctrine of
benami. The first view is that the benamidar does not hold title over the
property, and the second view is that although the title passes to the
benamidar, he holds it in trust.
16. Eventually, there developed two loose categories of transactions
that were colloquially termed as benami, which can be explained
through the following examples:
16.1. Tripartite : B sells a property to A (real owner), but the sale
deed mentions C as the owner/benamidar.
16.2. Bipartite : A sells property to B without intending to pass the
title to B.
17. The first instance was usually termed as a real benami
transaction, and the second transaction was considered either as a
sham transaction or "loosely" benami transaction. In Sree Meenakshi
Mills Ltd. V. CIT13, speaking for the Bench, Venkatarama Ayyar, J.,
stated that the first category of transactions is "usually" termed as
benami, while the second category is "occasionally" considered a
benami transaction. He added that it is "perhaps not accurately so
used". In Bhim Singh V. Kan Singh14, Venkataramiah, J. straightaway
called the first category as benami but chose to describe the second
category as "loosely" termed benami. This distinction is relevant and
will be adverted to later.
18. Numerous reasons, some desirable and some undesirable, were
contributory factors for the proliferation of such a practice in India.
Some of them are as follows:
(i) Secret provisions for families within Hindu joint family
system; 15
(ii) Mitigation of political and social risk; 16
(iii) Defrauding creditors;17
(iv) Evasion of taxes.
19. Judicial recognition of such transactions came about in the early
19th Century under the colonial courts. In Bilas Kunwar V. Desraj Ranjit
"
Down to the taluqdar's death the natural inference is that the
purchase was a benami transaction; a dealing common to Hindus
and Muhammadans alike, and much in use in India; it is quite
unobjectionable and has a curious resemblance to the doctrine of our
English law that the trust of the legal estate results to the man who
pays the purchase money, and this again follows the analogy of our
common law, that where a feoffment is made without consideration
the use results to the feoffer."
20. In Punjab Province V. Daulat Singh19, the Federal Court, while
OnLine FC)
"... " A notion has sometimes prevailed in this country that all
benami transactions must be regarded as reprehensible and
improper if not illegal; but, as late as in 1915, Sir George Farwell,
delivering the judgment of the Judicial Committee in Bilas Kunwar V.
Desraj Ranjit Singh18 spoke of them as "quite unobjectionable" and
as having their analogues in the English law; and Mr Ameer Ali,
delivering the judgment of the Committee in Gur Narayan V. Sheo
'there is nothing inherently wrong in it, and it accords, within its
legitimate scope, with the ideas and habits of the people'.
As indicated by the qualifying words "within its legitimate scope", their Lordships'
observations were clearly not meant to countenance transactions entered into for
fraudulent or illegal purposes."
21. In Jaydayal Poddar V. Bibi Hazra²1 21 , this Court laid down a test to
determine whether a transaction is benami or not. The following factors
were to be considered:
21.1. The source from which the purchase money came.
21.2. The nature and possession of property after purchase.
21.3. Motive, if any, for giving the transaction a benami colour.
21.4. The position of the parties and the relationship, if any,
between the claimant and the alleged benamidar.
21.5. The custody of the title deeds after the sale.
21.6. The conduct of the parties concerned in dealing with the
property after the sale.
22. The judiciary came to establish the general principle that in law,
the real owner is recognised over the ostensible owner. 22 This principle
had certain statutory exceptions, albeit limited, such as Section 66 of
the Civil Procedure Code, 1908 with respect to properties wherein sale
certificates are issued by courts; and Section 281-A of the Income Tax
Act, 1961, which allows filing of suit by the original owner to enforce
his right over a benami property, only if the same is declared for taxing
purpose, as provided thereunder. Such provision under the Income Tax
Act did not bar such benami transactions completely, rather it only
attempted to legitimise and bring them into the net of taxation. Such
provision, while disincentivising transactions beyond the taxation net,
had also inevitably accepted the positive factors in recognising the
same. Further, it is a matter of fact that the Trusts Act, 1882 has
recognised and accepted the principle behind benami transactions.
23. The 57th Report of the Law Commission (1973) succinctly
captures the general principles prevailing as on that date, in the
following manner:
"5.2. Summary of present position-In general.- few basic
points concerning benami transactions may be stated, as follows:
(a) Benami transfer or transaction means the transfer by or to a
person who acts only as the ostensible owner in place of real owner
whose name is not disclosed;
(b) The question whether such transfer or transaction was real or
benami depends upon the intention of the beneficiary;
(c) The real owner in such cases may be called the beneficiary,
and the ostensible owner the benamidar.
*
*
*
5.3. Effect of benami transfer. - The effect of a benami transfer
is as follows:
(a) A person does not acquire any interest in property by merely
lending his name;
(b) The benamidar has no beneficial interest though he may
represent the legal owner as to third persons.
(c) A benami transaction is legal, except in certain specified
situations."
(emphasis supplied)
24. Prior to the 1973 Report, the broad position on the legality of
various kinds of benami transactions can be captured as follows:

25. It may be necessary to note that the Law Commission, through
its aforementioned 57th Report, did not find it suitable to accept the
stringent provision of making benami transactions liable to criminal
action. Rather, it recommended adoption of certain less stringent, civil
alternatives in the following manner:
"6.3. Possible alternative for regulating benami transaction.
-Several possible alternatives could be thought of, with reference to
prohibiting or regulating benami transactions for avoiding prejudice
to private individuals or minimising litigation:
(i) Entering into benami transactions could be made an
offence.
(ii) A provision may be enacted to the effect that in a civil suit
a right shall not be enforced against the benamidar or against a
third person, by or on behalf of the person claiming to be the real
owner of the property on the ground of benami; a similar
provision could be made to bar defences on the ground of benami.
(This provision would be based on the principle on which the
existing provisions in the Civil Procedure Code and the new
provision in the Income Tax Act are based but could be wider in
scope and more radical.)
(iii) The present presumption of a resulting trust in favour of
the person who provided the consideration may be displaced (as
in England) by the presumption of advancement, in cases where
the person to whom property is transferred is a near relative of
the person who provided the consideration. (This would bring in
the doctrine of advancement, so as to rebut the presumption of
resulting trust under Section 82 of the Trusts Act.)
Whichever alternative is adopted, it may be desirable to make an
exception for an acquisition made by the manager of a joint Hindu
family in the name of one of the coparceners, and similar cases.
*
*
*
6.24. First alternative not likely to be effective.- - The first
alternative referred to above, namely, the imposition of a criminal
prohibition against benami transactions, is the most drastic
alternative, but it is not likely to be more effective than the others. A
prohibition backed by criminal sanctions
would not, moreover, be desirable, unless the mens rea is also included
in the provision to be enacted.
If this alternative is to be adopted, a provision could be enacted
on the following lines:
'Where property is transferred to one person for a consideration
paid or provided by another person, and it appears that such
person did not intend to pay or provide such consideration for the
benefit of the transferee, the person paying or providing the
consideration shall be guilty of an offence punishable with
imprisonment up to three years, or with fine, or both.
Provided that this section shall not apply where the transferee
is a co-parcener in a Hindu Undivided Family in which such other
person is also a co-parcener, and it is proved that such other
person intended to pay or provide such consideration for the
benefit of the coparceners in the family.
Exception-Nothing in this section shall be deemed to affect
Section 66 of the Civil Procedure Code, 1908 or any provision
similar thereto.
Yet another device for giving effect to the first alternative, with
a requirement of mens rea, would be to have a law on the
following lines:
'Where property is transferred to one person for a consideration
paid or provided by another person, and it appears that such
person did not intend to pay or provide such consideration for the
benefit of the transferee, the person paying : or providing the
consideration shall, if he has caused the transfer to be entered
into with the intention of facilitating the evasion of any law, or
defeating the claims of his creditors, or the creditors of any other
person be guilty of an offence punishable with imprisonment up to
three years, or with fine, or with both.'
Yet another device to give effect to the first alternative would
be to add a section in the Penal Code, 1860 as follows:
`421-A. Whoever, dishonestly or fraudulently causes to be
transferred to any person, any property, for which transfer he has
paid or provided the consideration, intending thereby to prevent,
or knowing to be likely that he will thereby prevent, the
distribution of that property according to law among his creditors
or the creditors of any other person, or intending thereby to
facilitate, or knowing it to be likely that he will thereby facilitate,
the evasion of any law, shall be punished with imprisonment of
either description for a term which may extend to two years, or
with fine. or with both.'
6.25. Second alternative.-The - second alternative is less drastic
than the first. In form it could follow the existing statutory provision
limiting the judicial recognition of benami transactions, such as,
Section 66, Civil Procedure Code, 1908. But its scope would be much
wider. The provision
could be to the effect that no suit shall lie to enforce a right in respect
of any property held benami, either against the person in whose name
the property is held or against any other person, by or on behalf of a
person who claims to be the real owner of the property on the ground
that the person in whose name the property is held is a benamidar of
the claimant. (If necessary, a defence can also be barred).
*
*
*
6.27. Second alternative refusal to recognise benami
preferred.- our opinion, the simplest alternative would be the
second alternative. The law should refuse to recognise the benami
character of transactions, without making them an offence. The law
should, in effect, provide that where property is transferred benami,
the benamidar will become the real owner. The result of such a
provision will be that the fact that the benamidar did not provide the
consideration, or that the consideration was provided by a third
person, will not be a ground for recognising a person other than the
benamidar as owner. To put the matter in broad terms, the doctrine
of benami will, under the proposed amendment, cease to be a part of
the Indian law.
It may be observed that in enacting the proposed provision, the
legislature will carry, to its logical conclusion, the trend illustrated by
provisions, such as, Section 66 of the Code of Civil Procedure. The
section in the Code is applicable to involuntary alienations, while the
proposed provision will extend the same principle to voluntary
transactions as well.
We think that this will be the simplest and most effective course,
and is, therefore, preferable to others.
The amendment will bring out a change in the legal position in
some of the situations where, at present, the benami character is
recognised.
6.27-A. We are also of the view that it is not necessary to enact a
prohibition attracting criminal penalties-which is the course
suggested in the first alternative. Such a prohibition will have to be
accompanied by a requirement of mens rea, thus narrowing down its
scope and limiting its practical utility."
(emphasis in original)
26. It must be noted that during this time, the Constitution was
undergoing a slow churning qua the right to property. The above
propositions, laid down by the Federal Courts and Privy Council are to
be understood in a context where there was a general common law
right to property, which later made its forays into the Constitution of
India under Articles 19(1)(f) and 31. In 1978, the Indian Parliament
took a drastic measure and did away with this fundamental right to
property and relegated the same to a constitutional right under Article
300-A.
27. Further, it was an era during which India pursued "socialism",
which was also included in the Preamble to the Constitution through
the 42nd (Amendment) Act in 1976. Successive judicial opinions in
Kesavananda Bharati V. State of Kerala²3 etc. viewed the right to
property as a stumbling
block in the path of achieving social goals that the Government of the
time aspired to.
28. In 1988, an Ordinance-viz the Benami Transactions
(Prohibition of the Right to Recover Property) Ordinance, 1988
(Ordinance 2 of 1988)-was promulgated. This statutory instrument
being not satisfactory, it was referred to the Law Commission again.
29. In any case, the issue was re-examined by the Law Commission
in the year 1988 through its 130th Report. Although the Law
Commission characterised the 130th Report as a continuation of its
earlier recommendations, it can be observed that some radical changes
were suggested. Some of the key observations are as under:
"3.2. The first question that must engage our attention at once is
the width and coverage of the proposed legislation. In order to
encompass benami transactions concerning various types of
property, the legislation should cover both movable, immovable,
tangible and intangible property. Unfortunately every type of
property, such as land, houses, shares, debentures, bonds, bank
accounts, deposit receipts and negotiable instruments, is capable of
being held benami. Therefore, it is equally legitimate to have an
extensive coverage of the proposed legislation by encompassing
property of every denomination.
*
*
*
3.18. Therefore, viewed from either angle, the Law Commission is
of the firm opinion that the legislation replacing the Ordinance
should also be retroactive in operation and that no locus poenitentiae
need be given to the persons who had entered into benami
transactions in the past. They had notice of one-and-a-half decades
to set their house in order. No more indulgence is called for.
*
*
*
4.5. Before we conclude on this Chapter, it is necessary to point
out that certain tax laws have confirmed legitimacy on the benami
transactions and derived benefit in the form of revenue collection
from it. It was, therefore, said that if now all benami transactions are
invalidated and an all-enveloping prohibition is imposed, the revenue
laws would suffer loss of revenue. Reference in this connection was
made to Section 27 of the Income Tax Act, 1961 dealing with
income from house property. The various sub-sections of Section 27
deal with transfer of property by husband to wife and vice versa. It
also involves the case of impartible estate. The Law Commission is
unable to appreciate how a total prohibition of benami transaction
and the holder being made the real owner would defeat revenue
laws. If one escapes, the other pays, and if it is suggested that the
other may not be within the dragnet of the tax laws and that both
would benefit by the prohibition and abolition of benami
transactions. In the immediate future such effect may be produced
but the long term interest would help in defending such spurious
transactions between husband and wife. Section 22 may be read
accordingly. But it was pointed out that where transfer of flats is
prohibited either by the rules of the cooperative society which has
built the flats or by the rules of authorities like the Delhi
Development Authority, a modus operandi has come into existence
whereby violating the law, the flat is sold and the purchaser would pay
the amount and take an irrevocable power of attorney and enter into
possession. It was further said that the provisions of the Income Tax
Act have recognised such transfers and treat the attorney as owner for
the purpose of income tax as per the provisions of the Finance Act,
1987. If the sole purpose of entering into such a transaction is the
violation of existing law which has been passed after due consideration,
it is time that no recognition is conferred and the law is allowed to take
its own course. Even in the name of revenue loss, violation of existing
laws cannot be protected.
4.6. The Law Commission would like to make it very clear that
some of the provisions of the tax laws may become anachronistic
because of the present approach of the Law Commission. This is
inevitable. The tax laws were enacted at the time when benami was
a part of Indian law. Such laws would have to conform to the
changing legal order. Yet a further solution is offered in this behalf in
the next chapter."
(emphasis supplied)
Framework under the 1988 Act
30. This brings us to the statutory framework under the unamended
1988 Act, having nine sections. Section 2(a) defines "benami
transactions" as any transaction in which property is transferred to one
person for a consideration paid or provided by another person. The law
chose to include only tripartite benami transactions, while
bipartite/loosely described as benami transactions, were left out of the
definition. Reading the aforesaid definition to include sham/bipartite
arrangements within the ambit would be against the strict reading of
criminal law and would amount to judicial overreach.
31. The above definition does not capture the essence of benami
transactions as the broad formulation includes certain types of
legitimate transactions as well. The transferee/property holder's lack of
beneficial interest in the property was a vital ingredient, as settled by
years of judicial pronouncements and common parlance, and found to
be completely absent in the definition given in the Act. On literal
application of the aforesaid Section 2(a), the following transactions
could have been caught in the web of the Act:
31.1. A purchases property in name of his son's wife B, for the
benefit of the son's family from person Y, treats the consideration as a
gift to the son, and pays gift tax on it.
31.2. A who is old and infirm, purchases a property in the name of
B, intending that B will hold the property in trust of the son of A, who is
mentally retarded.
31.3. A firm X purchases property in the name of the working
partner B for the benefit of the firm X, making the payment out of the
firm's funds.
32. Section 2(c) of the 1988 Act defines "property" to be property of
any kind, whether movable or immovable, tangible, or intangible, and
includes any right or interest in such property. This definition appears
to be broad and inclusive of all kinds of property and includes various
rights and interests. Interestingly, the aforesaid broad formulation of
property came about for the
first time in the 130th Law Commission Report; such definitional
broadening was for the first time introduced only in 1988 and was
never contemplated during the 57th Report (1973). This aspect
becomes important, and will be addressed later, while analysing the
question of retrospectivity.
33. Section 3 of the 1988 Act states as under:
"3. Prohibition of benami transactions.-(1) No person shall
enter into any benami transaction.
(2) Nothing in sub-section (1) shall apply to the purchase of
property by any person in the name of his wife or unmarried
daughter and it shall be presumed, unless the contrary is proved,
that the said property had been purchased for the benefit of the wife
or the unmarried daughter.
(3) Whoever enters into any benami transaction shall be
punishable with imprisonment for a term which may extend to three
years or with fine or with both.
(4) Notwithstanding anything contained in the Code of Criminal
Procedure, 1973 (2 of 1974), an offence under this section shall be
non-cognizable and bailable."
Section 3 puts forth a prohibitive provision. Further, it intended to
criminalise an act of entering into a benami transaction.
34. Section 4 noted as under:
"4. Prohibition of the right to recover property held benami.
-(1) No suit, claim or action to enforce any right in respect of any
property held benami against the person in whose name the
property is held or against any other person shall lie by or on behalf
of a person claiming to be the real owner of such property.
(2) No defence based on any right in respect of any property held
benami, whether against the person in whose name the property is
held or against any other person, shall be allowed in any suit, claim
or action by or on behalf of a person claiming to be the real owner of
such property.
(3) Nothing in this section shall apply-
(a) where the person in whose name the property is held is a
coparcener in a Hindu Undivided Family and the property is held
for the benefit of the coparceners in the family; or
(b) where the person in whose name the property is held is a
trustee or other person standing in a fiduciary capacity, and the
property is held for the benefit of another person for whom he is a
trustee or towards whom he stands in such capacity."
35. Section 5 states:
"5. Property held benami liable to acquisition.-(1) All
properties held benami shall be subject to acquisition by such
authority, in such manner and after following such procedure as may
be prescribed.
(2) For the removal of doubts, it is hereby declared that no
amount shall be payable for the acquisition of any property under
sub-section (1)."
It may be noted that Section 5 was never utilised as it was felt that
there was requirement of additional statutory backing to make the law
effective. 24
36. Section 6 provided that nothing in the 1988 Act will affect
Section 53 of the Transfer of Property Act or any law relating to
transfers for an illegal purpose. The object of Section 6 was to vest
ownership rights in benamidars as opposed to the real owner. It was
not the intention of the 1988 Act to protect such persons from creditors
who allege diversion of funds in a fraudulent manner and allow them to
escape their liability to the creditors. Therefore, Section 6 limited the
application of Section 4 in such cases.
37. Section 7 of the 1988 Act repealed Sections 81, 82 and 94 of the
Trusts Act, 1882 (2 of 1882); Section 66 of the Code of Civil Procedure,
1908 (5 of 1908); and Section 281-A of the Income Tax Act, 1961 (43
of 1961). Section 8 empowered the Central Government to make rules
to give effect to the Act. The final section, Section 9, repealed the
earlier Ordinance.
38. The main thrust of the argument put forth by the Union of India
in this appeal is that the amended 2016 Act only clarified the 1988 Act.
The law officers appearing for the Union of India trained their guns on
the point that the 1988 Act had already created substantial law for
criminalising the offence and the 2016 Amendments were merely
clarificatory and procedural, to give effect to the 1988 Act. Such a
submission mandates us to examine the law of the 1988 Act in detail
and determine the scope of the earlier regime to understand as to
whether the 2016 Amendments were substantive or procedural.
39. Reading Section 2(a) along with Section 3 makes one thing clear
- the criminal provision envisaged under the aforesaid provisions does
not expressly contemplate mens rea. Under the Indian jurisprudence,
the law on the subject is fairly well-settled. It has been subjected to
the judicial scrutiny of this Court on several occasions. It does not call
for a detailed discussion and is enough to restate the principles. Mens
rea is an essential ingredient of a criminal offence. Doubtless, a statute
may exclude the element of mens rea, but it is a sound rule of
construction adopted in England-and also accepted in India-to
construe a statutory provision creating an offence in conformity with
common law rather than against it, unless the statute expressly or by
necessary implication excluded mens rea. The mere fact that the object
of the statute is to promote welfare activities or to eradicate a grave
social evil which by itself is not decisive of the question as to whether
the element of a guilty mind is excluded from the ingredients of an
offence. Mens rea by necessary implication may be excluded from a
statute only where it is absolutely clear that implementation of the
object of the statute would otherwise be defeated. [Refer Nathulal V.
State of M.P. 25
40. In the above light, this Court's first endeavour is to attempt to
interpret the law to imply mens rea. However, the language of Section
2(a) coupled with Section 3, completely ignores the aspect of mens rea,
as it intends to criminalise the very act of one person paying
consideration for acquisition of
property for another person. The mens rea aspect was specifically
considered by the 57th Law Commission Report, and the same was not
integrated into the unamended 1988 Act. The observations made in the
130th Law Commission Report indicate that benami transactions are
abhorrent when it comes to public wealth and impedes the Government
from achieving its social goals. This clearly allows us to infer that the
1988 law was envisaged on the touchstone of strict liability.
41. Such strict statutory formulation under Section 2(a) read with
Section 3 had left loose ends in the 1988 Act. In this light, the
prosecution would only have to prove only that consideration was paid
or consideration was provided by one person for another person and
nothing more. In all the judicial precedents, this Court has had the
occasion to examine this legislation on the civil side and never on the
criminal side, which would bear a higher standard. Conflation of the
ingredients under Sections 3(1) and (2) with those of Section 4, to
forcefully implied mens rea, cannot be accepted.
42. It may be noted that the Supreme Court has dealt with the
interpretation of Section 4 of the 1988 Act, on several occasions. In
Mithilesh Kumari V. Prem Behari Khare80, this Court was called upon to
examine as to whether the aforesaid provision has retrospective
"22. As defined in Section 2(a) of the Act "benami transaction"
means any transaction in which property is transferred to one person
for a consideration paid or provided by another person. A transaction
must, therefore, be benami irrespective of its date or duration.
Section 3, subject to the exceptions, states that no person shall
enter into any benami transaction. This section obviously cannot
have retrospective operation. However, Section 4 clearly provides
that no suit, claim or action to enforce any right in respect of any
property held benami against the person in whose name the
property is held or against any other person shall lie, by or on behalf
of a person claiming to be real owner of such property. This naturally
relates to past transactions as well. The expression "any property
held benami" is not limited to any particular time, date or duration.
Once the property is found to have been held benami, no suit, claim
or action to enforce any right in respect thereof shall lie. Similarly,
sub-section (2) of Section 4 nullifies the defences based on any right
in respect of any property held benami whether against the person in
whose name the property is held or against any other person in any
suit, claim or action by or on behalf of a person claiming to be the
real owner of such property. It means that once a property is found
to have been held benami, the real owner is bereft of any defence
against the person in whose name the property is held or any other
person. In other words in its sweep Section 4 envisages past benami
transactions also within its retroactivity. In this sense the Act is both
a penal and a disqualifying statute. In case of a qualifying or
disqualifying statute it may be necessarily retroactive. For example
when a
Law of Representation declares that all who have attained 18 years
shall be eligible to vote, those who attained 18 years in the past would
be as much eligible as those who attained that age at the moment of
the law coming into force. When an Act is declaratory in nature the
presumption against retrospectivity is not applicable. Acts of this kind
only declare. A statute in effect declaring the benami transactions to be
unenforceable belongs to this type. The presumption against taking
away vested right will not apply in this case inasmuch as under law it is
the benamidar in whose name the property stands, and law only
enabled the real owner to recover the property from him which right
has now been ceased by the Act. In one sense there was a right to
recover or resist in the real owner against the benamidar. Ubi jus ibi
remedium. Where there is a right, there is a remedy. Where the remedy
is barred, the right is rendered unenforceable. In this sense it is a
disabling statute. All the real owners are equally affected by the
disability provision irrespective of the time of creation of the right. A
right is a legally protected interest. The real owner's right was hitherto
protected and the Act has resulted in removal of that protection.
23. When the law nullifies the defences available to the real owner
in recovering the benami property from the benamidar the law must
apply irrespective of the time of the benami transactions. The
expression "shall lie" in Section 4(1) and "shall be allowed" in
Section 4(2) are prospective and shall apply to present (future
stages) and future suits, claims or actions only. This leads us to the
question whether there was a present suit between the respondent-
plaintiff and the appellant-defendant on the date of the law coming
into force. We have noted the dates of filing the suit and judgments
of the courts below. On the date of Section 4 of the Act coming into
force, that is, 19-5-1988 this appeal was pending and, of course, is
still pending. Can the suit itself be said to be pending?"
(emphasis supplied)
43. The aforesaid interpretation was re-examined by this Court in R.
Rajagopal Reddy V. Padmini Chandrasekharan° and while partly
overruling Mithilesh Kumari , it was held as under : (R. Rajagopal
"11.
Thus it was enacted to efface the then existing right of the
real owners of properties held by others benami. Such an Act was
not given any retrospective effect by the legislature. Even when we
come to Section 4, it is easy to visualise that sub-section (1) of
Section 4 states that no suit, claim or action to enforce any right in
respect of any property held benami against the person in whose
name the property is held or against any other shall lie by or on
behalf of a person claiming to be the real owner of such property. As
per Section 4(1) no such suit shall thenceforth lie to recover the
possession of the property held benami by the defendant. The
plaintiff's right to that effect is sought to be taken away and any suit
to enforce such a right after coming into operation of Section 4(1)
that is 19-5-1988, shall not
lie. The legislature in its wisdom has nowhere provided in Section 4(1)
that no such suit, claim or action pending on the date when Section 4
came into force shall not be proceeded with and shall stand abated. On
the contrary, clear legislative intention is seen from the words "no such
claim, suit or action shall lie", meaning thereby no such suit, claim or
action shall be permitted to be filed or entertained or admitted to the
portals of any court for seeking such a relief after coming into force of
Section 4(1).
The word "lie" in connection with the suit, claim or action is not defined by the Act.
If we go by the aforesaid dictionary meaning it would mean that such suit, claim or
action to get any property declared benami will not be admitted on behalf of such
plaintiff or applicant against the defendant concerned in whose name the property
is
held on and from the date on which this prohibition against entertaining of such
suits comes into force. With respect, the view taken that Section 4(1) would apply
even to such pending suits which were already filed and entertained prior to the
date when the section came into force and which has the effect of destroying the
then existing right of plaintiff in connection with the suit property cannot be
sustained in the face of the clear language of Section 4(1). It has to be visualised
that the legislature in its wisdom has not expressly made Section 4 retrospective.
Then to imply by necessary implication that Section 4 would have retrospective
effect and would cover pending litigations filed prior to coming into force of the
section would amount to taking a view which would run counter to the legislative
scheme and intent projected by various provisions of the Act to which we have
referred earlier. It is, however, true as held by the Division Bench that on the
express language of Section 4(1) any right inhering in the real owner in respect of
any property held benami would get effaced once Section 4(1) operated, even if
such transaction had been entered into prior to the coming into operation of
Section 4(1), and henceafter Section 4(1) applied no suit can lie in respect to
such a past benami transaction. To that extent the section may be retroactive. To
highlight this aspect we may take an illustration. If a benami transaction has taken
place in 1980 and a suit is filed in June 1988 by the plaintiff claiming that he is the
real owner of the property and defendant is merely a benamidar and the
consideration has flown from him, then such a suit would not lie on account of the
provisions of Section 4(1). Bar against filing, entertaining and admission of such
suits would have become operative by June 1988 and to that extent Section 4(1)
would take in its sweep even past benami transactions which are sought to be
litigated upon after coming into force of the prohibitory provision of Section 4(1);
but that is the only effect of the retroactivity of Section 4(1) and nothing more than
that. From the conclusion that Section 4(1) shall apply even to past benami
transactions to the aforesaid extent, the next step taken by the Division Bench
that therefore, the then existing rights got destroyed and even though suits by
real owners were filed prior to coming into operation of Section 4(1) they would
not survive, does not logically follow.
12. So far as Section 4(2) is concerned, all that is provided is that
if a suit is filed by a plaintiff who claims to be the owner of the
property under the document in his favour and holds the property in
his name, once Section 4(2) applies, no defence will be permitted or
allowed in any such suit, claim or action by or on behalf of a person
claiming to be the real owner of such property held benami. The
disallowing of such a defence which earlier was available, itself
suggests that a new liability or restriction is imposed by Section 4(2)
on a pre-existing right of the defendant. Such a provision also
cannot be said to be retrospective or retroactive by necessary
implication. It is also pertinent to note that Section 4(2) does not
expressly seek to apply retrospectively. So far as such a suit which is
covered by the sweep of Section 4(2) is concerned, the prohibition of
Section 4(1) cannot apply to it as it is not a claim or action filed by
the plaintiff to enforce right in respect of any property held benami.
On the contrary, it is a suit, claim or action flowing from the sale
deed or title deed in the name of the plaintiff. Even though such a
suit might have been filed prior to 19-5-1988, if before the stage of
filing of defence by the real owner is reached, Section 4(2) becomes
operative from 19-5-1988, then such a defence, as laid down by
Section 4(2) will not be allowed to such a defendant. However, that
would not mean that Section 4(1) and Section 4(2) only on that
score can be treated to be impliedly retrospective so as to cover all
the pending litigations in connection with enforcement of such rights
of real owners who are parties to benami transactions entered into
prior to the coming into operation of the Act and specially Section 4
thereof. It is also pertinent to note that Section 4(2) enjoins that no
such defence "shall be allowed" in any claim, suit or action by or on
behalf of a person claiming to be the real owner of such property.
That is to say no such defence shall be allowed for the first time after
coming into operation of Section 4(2). If such a defence is already
allowed in a pending suit prior to the coming into operation of
Section 4(2), enabling an issue to be raised on such a defence, then
the Court is bound to decide the issue arising from such an already
allowed defence as at the relevant time when such defence was
allowed Section 4(2) was out of the picture. Section 4(2) nowhere
uses the words:) No defence based on any right in respect of any
property held benami whether against the person in whose name the
property is held or against any other person, shall be allowed to be
raised or continued to be raised in any suit.' With respect, it was
wrongly assumed by the Division Bench that such an already allowed
defence in a pending suit would also get destroyed after coming into
operation of Section 4(2). We may at this stage refer to one difficulty
projected by learned advocate for the respondents in his written
submissions, on the applicability of Section 4(2). These submissions
read as under:
*
*
*
13. According to us this difficulty is inbuilt in Section 4(2) and
does not provide the rationale to hold that this section applies
retrospectively. The legislature itself thought it fit to do so and there
is no challenge to
the vires on the ground of violation of Article 14 of the Constitution. It
is not open to us to rewrite the section also. Even otherwise, in the
operation of Sections 4(1) and (2), no discrimination can be said to
have been made amongst different real owners of property, as tried to
be pointed out in the written objections. In fact, those cases in which
suits are filed by real owners or defences are allowed prior to coming
into operation of Section 4(2), would form a separate class as compared
to those cases where a stage for filing such suits or defences has still
not reached by the time Sections 4(1) and (2) start operating.
Consequently, latter type of cases would form a distinct category of
cases. There is no question of discrimination being meted out while
dealing with these two classes of cases differently. A real owner who
has already been allowed defence on that ground prior to coming into
operation of Section 4(2) cannot be said to have been given a better
treatment as compared to the real owner who has still to take up such a
defence and in the meantime he is hit by the prohibition of Section 4
(2). Equally there cannot be any comparison between a real owner who
has filed such suit earlier and one who does not file such suit till
Section 4(1) comes into operation. All real owners who stake their
claims regarding benami transactions after Sections 4(1) and (2) came
into operation are given uniform treatment by these provisions,
whether they come as plaintiffs or as defendants. Consequently, the
grievances raised in this connection cannot be sustained."
(emphasis supplied)
44. Returning to the discussion at hand, there is no doubt that the
unamended 1988 Act tried to create a strict liability offence and
allowed separate acquisition of benami property. This begs the question
whether such a criminal provision, which the State now intends to
make use of, in order to confiscate properties after 28 years of
dormancy, could have existed in the books of law. Other than the abuse
and unfairness such exercise intends to bring about, there is a larger
constitutional question about existence of such strict provisions without
adequate safeguards.
Substantive due process, manifest arbitrariness and provisions
under the 1988 Act
45. The simple question addressed by the counsel appearing for
both sides is whether the amended 2016 Act is retroactive or
prospective. Answering the above question is inevitably tied to an
intermediate question as to whether the 1988 Act was constitutional in
the first place. The arguments addressed by the Union of India hinge on
the fact that the 1988 Act was a valid substantive law, which required
only some gap filling through the 2016 Act, to ensure that sufficient
procedural safeguards and mechanisms are present to enforce the law.
According to the Union of India, the 2016 Act was a mere gap-filling
exercise.
46. However, upon studying the provisions of the 1988 Act, we find
that there are questions of legality and constitutionality which arise
with respect to Sections 3 and 5 of the 1988 Act. The answers to such
questions cannot be assumed in favour of constitutionality, simply
because the same was never questioned before the court of law. We are
clarifying that we are not speaking
of the presumption of constitutionality as a matter of burden of proof.
Rather, we are indicating the assumption taken by the Union as to the
validity of these provisions in the present litigation. Such assumption
cannot be made when this Court is called upon to answer whether the
impugned provisions are attracted to those transactions that have
taken place before 2016.
47. Indian jurisprudence has matured through years of judicial
tempering, and the country has grown to be a jurisdiction having
"substantive due process". A brief sketch of the jurisprudential journey
thus far, may be necessary to aid our understanding.
48. There is no gainsaying that deletion of the phrase "due process
of law" from the draft Constitution was inspired by the views of James
Bradley Thayer and Justice Felix Frankfurter, who held that
concentration of power to examine reasonability of a legislation through
judicial review would fall foul of separation of powers and denigration of
parliamentary sovereignty. Dr Ambedkar himself did not want to side
with any of the above opinions, rather he envisaged the situation as
one who is caught between Charybdis and Scylla.
49. The emphasis on the aforesaid deletion by the majority in A.K.
Gopalan V. State of Madras26, was somewhat drawn back by the
celebrated dissent of Fazl Ali, J., wherein the term "Procedure
established by law" was interpreted to mean "Procedural due process".
This judicial quibbling was ultimately set to rest in Maneka Gandhi V.
Union of India²7, , wherein a combined reading of Articles 14, 19 and 21
would make it clear that the judiciary, so to say, always had the
forensic power to examine reasonability of a law, both procedural as
well as substantive. Later expositions have only given colour to expand
what was implicit under the three golden Articles of Part III.
50. In Sunil Batra V. Delhi Admn. , the word "law" as occurring
under Article 21 was interpreted to mean jus and not merely lex. It
may be necessary to quote the observation of the majority in the
574-75, para 228)
"228.
The word "law" in the expression "procedure established
by law" in Article 21 has been interpreted to mean in Maneka Gandhi
case that the law must be right, just and fair and not arbitrary,
fanciful or oppressive."
(emphasis supplied)
51. Without burdening this judgment with a series of precedents laid
down by this Court, we may refer only to the majority opinion in K.S.
Puttaswamy (Privacy-9 J.) V. Union of India²9, wherein the law has been
settled by a nine-Judge Bench of this Court in the following manner :
"294. The Court, in the exercise of its power of judicial review, is
unquestionably vested with the constitutional power to adjudicate
upon the validity of a law. When the validity of a law is questioned
on the
ground that it violates a guarantee contained in Article 21, the scope of
the challenge is not confined only to whether the procedure for the
deprivation of life or personal liberty is fair, just and reasonable.
Substantive challenges to the validity of laws encroaching upon the
right to life or personal liberty has been considered and dealt with in
varying contexts, such as the death penalty (Bachan Singh3 30 and
mandatory death sentence Mithu³1), among other cases. A person
cannot be deprived of life or personal liberty except in accordance with
the procedure established by law. Article 14, as a guarantee against
arbitrariness, infuses the entirety of Article 21. The interrelationship
between the guarantee against arbitrariness and the protection of life
and personal liberty operates in a multi-faceted plane. First, it ensures
that the procedure for deprivation must be fair, just and reasonable.
Second, Article 14 impacts both the procedure and the expression
"law". A law within the meaning of Article 21 must be consistent with
the norms of fairness which originate in Article 14. As a matter of
principle, once Article 14 has a connect with Article 21, norms of
fairness and reasonableness would apply not only to the procedure but
to the law as well.
295. Above all, it must be recognised that judicial review is a
powerful guarantee against legislative encroachments on life and
personal liberty. To cede this right would dilute the importance of
the protection granted to life and personal liberty by the
Constitution. Hence, while judicial review in constitutional challenges
to the validity of legislation is exercised with a conscious regard for
the presumption of constitutionality and for the separation of powers
between the legislative, executive and judicial institutions, the
constitutional power which is vested in the Court must be retained
as a vibrant means of protecting the lives and freedoms of
individuals.
296. The danger of construing this as an exercise of "substantive
due process" is that it results in the incorporation of a concept from
the American Constitution which was consciously not accepted when
the Constitution was framed. Moreover, even in the country of its
origin, substantive due process has led to vagaries of judicial
interpretation. Particularly having regard to the constitutional history
surrounding the deletion of that phrase in our Constitution, it would
be inappropriate to equate the jurisdiction of a constitutional court in
India to entertain a substantive challenge to the validity of a law
with the exercise of substantive due process under the US
Constitution. Reference to substantive due process in some of the
judgments is essentially a reference to a substantive challenge to
the validity of a law on the ground that its substantive (as distinct
from procedural) provisions violate the Constitution."
52. The law with respect to testing the unconstitutionality of a
statutory instrument can be summarised as under:
52.1. Constitutional courts can test constitutionality of legislative
instruments (statute and delegated legislations).
52.2. The courts are empowered to test both on procedure as well as
substantive nature of these instruments.
52.3. The test should be based on a combined reading of Articles 14,
19 and 21 of the Constitution.
53. One of the offshoots of this test under Part III of the
Constitution is the development of the doctrine of manifest
arbitrariness. A doctrinal study of the development of this area may not
be warranted herein. It is well traced in Shayara Bano V. Union of
We may only state that the development of jurisprudence has
come full circle from an overly formalistic test of classification to include
the test of manifest arbitrariness. A broad formulation of the test was
"95. On a reading of this judgment in Natural Resources Allocation
case3³ it is clear that this Court did not read McDowell34 as being an
authority for the proposition that legislation can never be struck
down as being arbitrary. Indeed the Court, after referring to all the
earlier judgments, and Ajay Hasia 35 in particular, which stated that
legislation can be struck down on the ground that it is "arbitrary"
under Article 14, went on to conclude that "arbitrariness" when
applied to legislation cannot be used loosely. Instead, it broad based
the test, stating that if a constitutional infirmity is found, Article 14
will interdict such infirmity. And a constitutional infirmity is found in
Article 14 itself whenever legislation is "manifestly arbitrary" i.e.
when it is not fair, not reasonable, discriminatory, not transparent,
capricious, biased, with favouritism or nepotism and not in pursuit of
promotion of healthy competition and equitable treatment. Positively
speaking, it should conform to norms which are rational, informed
with reason and guided by public interest, etc."
(emphasis supplied)
54. In Joseph Shine V. Union of India 36, this Court was concerned
with the constitutionality of Section 497 IPC relating to the provision of
adultery. While declaring the aforesaid provision as unconstitutional on
the aspect of it being manifestly arbitrary, this Court reiterated the test
"26.
`101. The test of manifest arbitrariness, therefore, as laid
down in the aforesaid judgments would apply to invalidate
legislation as well as subordinate legislation under Article 14.
Manifest
arbitrariness, therefore, must be something done by the legislature
capriciously, irrationally and/or without adequate determining principle.
Also, when something is done which is excessive and disproportionate,
such legislation would be manifestly arbitrary. We are, therefore, of the
view that arbitrariness in the sense of manifest arbitrariness as pointed
out by us above would apply to negate legislation as well under Article
14.
(emphasis supplied)
55. In Hindustan Construction Co. Ltd. V. Union of India 37 37 this Court
struck down Section 87 of the Arbitration Act on the ground of manifest
arbitrariness as Parliament chose to ignore the judgment of this Court,
without removing the basis of the same or identifying a principle for
militating against the same.
56. Coming back to the 1988 Act, the two provisions with which we
are concerned are Sections 3 and 5 of the 1988 Act. They are required
to be separately analysed herein. At the outset, we may notice that the
enactment was merely a shell, lacking the substance that a criminal
legislation requires for being sustained. The reasons for the same are
enumerated in the following paragraphs.
57. First, the absence of mens rea creates a harsh provision having
strict liability. Such an approach was frowned upon by the 57th Law
Commission Report as concerns of tax evasion or sham transactions in
order to avoid payment to creditors were adequately addressed by the
existing provisions of law. Even the 130th Law Commission Report did
not expressly rule out the inclusion of mens rea. The legislative move to
ignore earlier Law Commission Reports without there being a principle
identified to do away with the aspect of mens rea should be a
contributory factor in analysing the constitutionality of the aforesaid
criminal provision under the 1988 Act.
58. Further, under the amended 2016 Act, the aspect of mens rea is
brought back through Section 53. Such resurrection clearly indicates
that doing away of the mens rea aspect, was without any rhyme or
reason, and ended up creating an unusually harsh enactment.
59. Second, ignoring the essential ingredient of beneficial ownership
exercised by the real owner contributes to making the law even more
stringent and disproportionate with respect to benami transactions that
are tripartite in nature. The Court cannot forcefully read the ingredients
developed through judicial pronouncements or under Section 4 (having
civil consequence) into the definition provided under Sections 2 and 3
(espousing criminal consequences), to save the enactment from
unconstitutionality. Such a reading would violate the express language
of Section 2(a), of excluding one ingredient from the definition of
"benami transaction", and would suffer from the vice of judicial
transgression. In removing such an essential ingredient, the legislature
did not identify any reason or principle, which made the entire provision
of Section 3 susceptible to arbitrariness. Interestingly, for tripartite
benami transactions, the 2016 Act brings back this ingredient through
Section 2(9)(A)(b). In this context, we may state that it is a simple
requirement under Article 20(1) of the Constitution that a law needs to
be clear and not vague. It should not have incurable gaps which are yet
to be legislated/filled in by judicial process.
60. Third, it is fairly admitted by the learned ASG, Mr Vikramjit
Banerjee appearing for the Union of India, that the criminal provision
was never utilised as there was a significant hiatus in enabling the
functioning of such a provision.
61. Fourth, reading Section 2(a) with Section 3(1) would have
created overly broad laws susceptible to be challenged on the grounds
of manifest arbitrariness. If this Court reads criminal provisions of the
Benami Act to have had force since 1988, then the following deleterious
consequences would ensue:
61.1. Section 187-C of the Companies Act, 1956 assured protection
to nominal and beneficial holding of shares if the prescribed declaration
duly made, is at serious risk.
61.2. Benami cooking gas connections which have been regularised
from time to time are at risk.
61.3. Housing colonies and benami allotments of DDA flats which
have been regularised from time to time are at risk.
62. The criminal provision under Section 3(1) of the 1988 Act has
serious lacunae which could not have been cured by judicial forums,
even through some form of harmonious interpretation. A conclusion
contrary to the above would make the aforesaid law suspect to being
overly oppressive, fanciful and manifestly arbitrary, thereby violating
the "substantive due process" requirement of the Constitution.
Coming to Section 5 of the 1988 Act, it must be noted that the
acquisition proceedings contemplated under the earlier Act were in rem
proceedings against benami property. We may note that,
jurisprudentially, such in rem proceedings transfer the guilt from the
person who utilised a property which is a general harm to the society,
to the property itself.
64. When such proceedings are contemplated under the law, there
need to be adequate safeguards built into the provisions, without which
the law would be susceptible to challenge under Article 14 of the
Constitution. Coming to Section 5 of the 1988 Act, it was conceived as
a half-baked provision which did not provide the following and rather
left the same to be prescribed through a delegated legislation:
(i) Whether the proceedings under Section 5 were independent or
dependent on successful prosecution?
(ii) The standard of proof required to establish benami transaction
in terms of Section 5.
(iii) Mechanism for providing opportunity for a person to establish
his defence.
(iv) No "defence of innocent owner" was provided to save
legitimate innocent buyers.
(v) No adjudicatory mechanism was provided for.
(vi) No provision was included to determine vesting of acquired
property.
(vii) No provision to identify or trace benami properties.
(viii) Condemnation of property cannot include the power of
tracing, which needs an express provision.
Such delegation of power to the authority was squarely excessive and
arbitrary as it stood. From the aforesaid, the Union's stand that the
2016 Act was merely procedural, cannot stand scrutiny.
65. In any case, such an inconclusive law, which left the essential
features to be prescribed through delegation, can never be
countenanced in law to be valid under Part III of the Constitution. The
gaps left in the 1988 Act were not merely procedural, rather the same
were essential and substantive. In the absence of such substantive
provisions, the omissions create a law which is fanciful and oppressive
at the same time. Such an overbroad provision was manifestly arbitrary
as the open texture of the law did not have sufficient safeguards to be
proportionate.
66. At this stage, we may only note that when a court declares a law
as unconstitutional, the effect of the same is that such a declaration
would render the law not to exist in the law books since its inception. It
is only a limited exception under constitutional law, or when substantial
actions have been undertaken under such unconstitutional laws that
going back to the original position would be next to impossible. In
those cases alone, would this Court take recourse to the concept of
"prospective overruling".
67. From the above, Section 3 (criminal provision) read with Section
2(a) and Section 5 (confiscation proceedings) of the 1988 Act are
overly broad, disproportionately harsh, and operate without adequate
safeguards in place. Such provisions were stillborn law and never
utilised in the first place. In this light, this Court finds that Sections 3
and 5 of the 1988 Act were unconstitutional from their inception.
68. Having said so, we make it abundantly clear that the aforesaid
discussion does not affect the civil consequences contemplated under
Section 4 of the 1988 Act, or any other provisions.
The 2016 Act and its analysis
69. The next subject of examination is the 2016 Act, which amends
the 1988 Act, and expanded the 1988 Act to 72 sections (from 9
sections), divided into 8 chapters. At the outset, we need to understand
the general scheme of the law. The definition of "benami transactions",
which is the heart of the entire 1988 Act, has undergone a
metamorphosis and stands as under:
"2. Definitions.
*
*
*
(9) "benami transaction" means-
(A) a transaction or an arrangement-
(a) where a property is transferred to, or is held by, a
person, and the consideration for such property has been
provided, or paid by, another person; and
(b) the property is held for the immediate or future benefit,
direct or indirect, of the person who has provided the
consideration,
except when the property is held by-
(i) a karta, or a member of a Hindu Undivided Family, as the
case may be, and the property is held for his benefit or benefit
of other members in the family and the consideration for such
property has been provided or paid out of the known sources of
the Hindu Undivided Family;
(ii) a person standing in a fiduciary capacity for the benefit
of another person towards whom he stands in such capacity
and includes a trustee, executor, partner, Director of a
company, a depository or a participant as an agent of a
depository under the Depositories Act, 1996 (22 of 1996) and
any other person as may be notified by the Central Government
for this purpose;
(iii) any person being an individual in the name of his
spouse or in the name of any child of such individual and the
consideration for such property has been provided or paid out
of the known sources of the individual;
(iv) any person in the name of his brother or sister or lineal
ascendant or descendant, where the names of brother or sister
or lineal ascendant or descendant and the individual appear as
joint owners in any document, and the consideration for such
property has been provided or paid out of the known sources of
the individual; or
(B) a transaction or an arrangement in respect of a property
carried out or made in a fictitious name; or
(C) a transaction or an arrangement in respect of a property
where the owner of the property is not aware of, or, denies
knowledge of, such ownership;
(D) a transaction or an arrangement in respect of a property
where the person providing the consideration is not traceable or is
fictitious;
Explanation.- - For the removal of doubts, it is hereby declared that
benami transaction shall not include any transaction involving the
allowing of possession of any property to be taken or retained in part
performance of a contract referred to in Section 53-A of the Transfer
of Property Act, 1882, if, under any law for the time being in force-
(i) consideration for such property has been provided by the
person to whom possession of property has been allowed but the
person who has granted possession thereof continues to hold
ownership of such property;
(ii) stamp duty on such transaction or arrangement has been
paid; and
(iii) the contract has been registered."
70. Major changes envisaged under the definition are as under:
70.1. Expansion of the definition from arm's length transactions
contemplated under the 1988 Act, to arrangements and schemes.
70.2. Additional ingredient of benefits flowing to the real owner, a
lacuna pointed in the earlier part, under the 1988 Act, is included in
terms of Section 2(9)(A)(b).
70.3. Expansion of the ambit through Section 2(9)(C), to those
properties where benamidar denies knowledge of such ownership.
70.4. Expansion of the ambit through Section 2(9)(D), wherein the
person providing the consideration is not traceable or is fictitious.
70.5. Expansion from recognition of only tripartite transactions
under the 1988 Act, to also include bipartite transactions.
71. Section 2(26) of the 2016 Act defines a "property". This
definition has been expanded to include proceeds from the property as
well. Such expansion allows for tracing of proceeds and is a substantial
change as compared to the 1988 Act. Along with this, "benami
property" has been defined under Section 2(8). "Benamidar" is defined
under Section 2(10).
72. Chapter 2 contains four provisions which are modified provisions
of the 1988 Act. Section 3 now bifurcates offences into two separate
categories based on the time period of the benami transaction. Under
Section 3(2), punishment of three years is mandated for those who
have entered into benami transactions from 5-9-1988 to 25-10-2016.
Section 3(3) applies to those benami transactions which have been
entered into after commencement of the amended 2016 Act and the
punishment for the aforesaid is prescribed under Section 53 of Chapter
VII. It may be noted that under Section 3(3), the punishment is
increased from three years to a maximum of seven years and a fine
may be imposed which extends up to 25% of the fair market value of
the property. This distinction between Sections 3(2) and 3(3) read with
Section 53, contains the element of mens rea.
73. Section 4 remains the same as under the 1988 Act, barring the
fact that Section 4(3) has integrated the exceptions provided under the
definition of "benami transaction" in terms of Section 2(9). The civil
consequences provided under Section 4 continue to apply even post the
2016 Act. The interpretation of the aforesaid section, as given in R.
Rajagopal Reddy case continues to apply.
74. Section 5 on the other hand has been modified and it presently
stands as under:
"5. Property held benami liable to confiscation.-Any
property, which is subject-matter of benami transaction, shall be
liable to be confiscated by the Central Government."
75. Chapter III relates to the administrative mechanism of the
authorities required for implementation of the 2016 Act. Chapter IV
relates to attachment, adjudication, and confiscation of benami
property. These provisions relate to forfeiture, which need to be
analysed hereinafter.
76. Section 24(1) states that, if the initiating officer, on the basis of
gathered material, having reason to believe, that a particular property
is a benami property, then he ought to issue notice38 to the beneficial
owner (if identified) as well as to the ostensible owner (if any) seeking
an explanation as to why the property should not be treated as benami.
77. The 2016 Act provides for provisional attachment of the property
where the officer concerned has genuine reason to believe, based on
the material gathered, that the person in possession of the property
held in benami may alienate the property. Such provisional attachment
cannot be taken recourse to every time. Recourse under Section 24(3)
of the 2016 Act should be exercised in exceptional circumstance after
previous approval of the approving authority. Such interim provisional
attachment is strictly limited by time.
78. Adjudication under Section 24(4) is mandatory and requires the
authority to examine the same on a prima facie basis. Such
adjudication must take place after providing collected material to the
accused, along with the show-cause notice. A reasoned order is
mandated under the aforesaid provision. The officer is mandated to
present a statement of case to the adjudicating officer, in terms of
Section 24(5) of the 2016 Act.
79. Adjudication under Section 26 mandates notice and disclosure
obligation to various other persons. The adjudicating authority can
either pass an order in terms of Section 26(3)(c)(i) or (ii), or pass an
order for further inquiries in terms of Section 26(3)(b).
80. Section 27(1) relates to confiscation of property, wherein if a
property is adjudicated as a benami property under Section 26(3), then
the adjudicating authority can give an opportunity to the persons
concerned, and after hearing the parties, pass an order confiscating the
property. The aforesaid confiscation order is subject to the order passed
by the Appellate Tribunal under Section 46. Order of confiscation vests
such property absolutely in the Central Government,
free from all encumbrances and no compensation shall be payable in
respect of such confiscation.
81. Section 27(4) provides that in the interregnum of initiating
confiscation proceedings, any third-party rights created to defeat the
purpose of the Act shall be null and void. Sub-section (5) mandates
that if no order of confiscation is made and the same has attained
finality, no claim can be made against the Government for the process.
82. Section 28 mandates appointment of an Administrator by the
Central Government to manage the property. Such an Administrator
shall have the power to take possession of such a property upon order
of confiscation, in terms of Section 29.
83. Chapters V and VI delineate the powers of the Appellate Tribunal
as well as Special Courts. Chapter VII consists of offences and
penalties. Specifically, we may refer to Section 53:
"53. Penalty for benami transaction.-(1) - Where any person
enters into a benami transaction in order to defeat the provisions of
any law or to avoid payment of statutory dues or to avoid payment
to creditors, the beneficial owner, benamidar and any other person
who abets or induces any person to enter into the benami
transaction, shall be guilty of the offence of benami transaction.
(2) Whoever is found guilty of the offence of benami transaction
referred to in sub-section (1) shall be punishable with rigorous
imprisonment for a term which shall not be less than one year, but
which may extend to seven years and shall also be liable to fine
which may extend to twenty-five per cent of the fair market value of
the property."
Interestingly, a crime which attracted strict liability under the 1988
Act, is modified to include a mens rea aspect in terms of the
recommendations of the 57th and 130th Law Commission Reports.
84. It may be necessary to note that no prosecution can be initiated
without previous sanction of the competent authority as provided under
Section 55, which reads as under:
"55. Previous sanction.- - No prosecution shall be instituted
against any person in respect of any offence under Sections 3, 53 or
Section 54 without the previous sanction of the Board."
85. Perusal of the remaining provisions is not required for the
purpose at hand.
Whether Section 3(1) and Chapter IV read with Section 5 of the
2016 Act have retroactive effect?
86. The thrust of the arguments advanced by the Union of India can
be crystallised as under:
86.1. That the 1988 Act was a valid enactment with procedural gaps
that were filled retrospectively by the 2016 Amendment.
86.2. That the provision of confiscation (civil forfeiture) under the
1988 Act, being in the domain of civil law, is not punitive and therefore,
the prohibition under Article 20(1) of the Constitution is not attracted
in this case.
87. With respect to the first line of argument, our discussion above
can be summarised as under:
87.1. Section 3(1) of the 1988 Act is vague and arbitrary.
87.2. Section 3(1) created an unduly harsh law against settled
principles and the Law Commission recommendations.
87.3. Section 5 of the 1988 Act, the provision relating to civil
forfeiture, was manifestly arbitrary.
87.4. Both provisions were unworkable and as a matter of fact, were
never implemented.
88. Having arrived at the aforesaid conclusions that Sections 3 and 5
were unconstitutional under the 1988 Act, it would mean that the 2016
Amendments were, in effect, creating new provisions and new offences.
Therefore, there was no question of retroactive application of the 2016
Act. As for the offence under Section 3(1) for those transactions that
were entered into between 5-9-1988 to 25-10-2016, the law cannot
retroactively invigorate a stillborn criminal offence, as established
above.
89. As per the concession made by the Union of India and a fair
reading of Section 53 of the 2016 Act, the offence under the aforesaid
provision is prospective, and only applied to those transactions that
were entered into after the Amendment came into force viz. 25-10-
2016. Any contrary interpretation of Section 3 of the 1988 Act would be
violative of Article 20(1) of the Constitution. Article 20(1) reads as
under:
"20. Protection in respect of conviction for offences.-(1) No
person shall be convicted of any offence except for violation of a law
in force at the time of the commission of the act charged as an
offence, nor be subjected to a penalty greater than that which might
have been inflicted under the law in force at the time of the
commission of the offence."
90. In T. Barai V. Henry Ah Hoe39 this Court has expounded Article
"22. It is only retroactive criminal legislation that is prohibited
under Article 20(1). The prohibition contained in Article 20(1) is that
no person shall be convicted of any offence except for violation of a
law in force at the time of the commission of the act charged as an
offence prohibits nor shall he be subjected to a penalty greater than
that which might have been inflicted under the law in force at the
time of the commission of the offence. It is quite clear that insofar as
the Central Amendment Act creates new offences or enhances
punishment for a particular type of offence no person can be
convicted by such ex post facto law nor can the enhanced
punishment prescribed by the amendment be applicable. But
insofar as the Central Amendment Act reduces the punishment for an
offence punishable under Section 16(1)(a) of the Act, there is no
reason why the accused should not have the benefit of such reduced
punishment. The rule of beneficial construction requires that even ex
post facto law of such a type should be applied to mitigate the rigour of
the law. The principle is based both on sound reason and common
sense. This finds support in the following passage from Craies on
Statute Law, 7th Edn., at pp. 388-89:
'A retrospective statute is different from an ex post facto
statute. "Every ex post facto law. " said Chase, J., in the American
case of Calder V. Bull40 "must necessarily be retrospective, but
every retrospective law is not an ex post facto law. Every law that
takes away or impairs rights vested agreeably to existing laws is
retrospective, and is generally unjust and may be oppressive; it is
a good general rule that a law should have no retrospect, but in
cases in which the laws may justly and for the benefit of the
community and also of individuals relate to a time antecedent to
their commencement : as statutes of oblivion or of pardon. They
are certainly retrospective, and literally both concerning and after
the facts committed. But I do not consider any law ex post facto
within the prohibition that mollifies the rigour of the criminal law,
but only those that create or aggravate the crime, or increase the
punishment or change the rules of evidence for the purpose of
conviction There is a great and apparent difference between
making an unlawful act lawful and making an innocent action
criminal and punishing it as a crime.'"
(emphasis in original and supplied)
91. In the case at hand, the 2016 Act containing the criminal
provisions is applicable only prospectively, as the relevant Sections of
the pre-Amendment 1988 Act containing the penal provision, have
been declared as unconstitutional. Therefore, the question of
construction of the 2016 Act as retroactive qua the penal provisions
under Sections 3 or 53, does not arise.
92. The continued presence of an unconstitutional law on the statute
book, or the claim that such law was not challenged before
constitutional courts, does not prevent this Court from holding that
such unconstitutional laws cannot enure to the benefit of or be utilised
to retroactively amend laws to cure existing constitutional defects. If
such curing is allowed, then Article 0(1) of the Constitution would be
rendered nugatory.
93. This brings us to the last aspect as to the retroactive operation
of confiscation (forfeiture) under Section 5 read with Chapter IV of the
2016 Act. It is the argument of the Union of India that civil forfeiture
being in the domain of civil law is not punitive in nature. Therefore, it
does not attract the prohibition contained under Article 20(1) of the
Constitution. Meaning thereby, that if this Court holds that the civil
forfeiture prescribed under the 2016 Act is punitive, only then will the
prohibition under Article 20(1) apply. If not, then the prohibition does
not apply.
94. Although we have held that Section 5 of the 1988 Act was
unconstitutional for being manifestly arbitrary, however such holding is
of no consequence if this Court comes to the conclusion that
confiscation under Section 5 of the 2016 Act read with Chapter IV, was
civil in nature and is not punitive.
95. It is well settled that the legislature has power to enact
retroactive/retrospective civil legislations under the Constitution.
However, Article 20(1) of the Constitution mandates that no law
mandating a punitive provision can be enacted retrospectively. Further,
a punitive provision cannot be couched as a civil provision to bypass
the mandate under Article 20(1) of the Constitution which follows the
settled legal principle that "what cannot be done directly, cannot be
done indirectly".
96. Therefore, the immediate question which arises for consideration
is whether the retroactive confiscation provided under Section 5 read
with Chapter IV of the 2016 Act is punitive or not?
97. At the outset, we may note that Shri S.V. Raju, learned ASG,
has submitted that acquisition provided under Section 5 of the 1988
Act is same as confiscation provided under Section 5 read with Chapter
IV of the 2016 Act. He states that both concepts are related to civil law
and are not concerned with punitive punishments as provided under
the Penal Code, 1860.
98. Acquisition under the earlier the 1988 Act as well as confiscation
under the 2016 Act are said to have been enacted on the reasoning
that the property emanating from the benami transaction also gets
tainted. The substantive difference between the acquisition provision
under the earlier enactment and the confiscation provision under the
2016 Act is that proceeds of benami transactions have been made
traceable under the 2016 Act.
99. Before we analyse the other provisions, it is necessary to give a
brief introduction to the concept of civil forfeiture in India, as the same
was argued by the learned ASG. Under Admiralty jurisdiction, the
Admiralty Courts concerned had the jurisdiction to forfeit vessels under
its civil jurisdiction in lieu of any maritime claim. Same was the law
across various common law jurisdictions, such as the United States of
America and the United Kingdom.
100. Forfeiture occurs in various types, few of which are found in
India. Broadly, forfeitures can be categorised as civil and criminal. On
the civil side, there can be in rem or in personam forfeitures. Punitive
forfeitures under the criminal law are in personam. Criminal forfeitures
usually take place at the conclusion of a trial, when the guilt of the
accused is established. Standards of evidentiary requirement differ
greatly between civil and criminal forfeitures.
101. The historic origin of in rem civil forfeiture in common law
jurisdictions was earlier mostly restricted to transnational crimes. These
early laws mandated that the property was subject to forfeiture because
it was the instrument by which the offence was committed, and it was
necessary to confiscate such property to remove it from circulation.
However. the Twentieth Centurv saw expansion of forfeiture laws into a
wide array of crimes. The
modern forfeiture laws not only allow forfeiture of property used to
facilitate the crime, but cover the proceeds of the offence as well.
102. In the Supreme Court of the United States, constitutional
challenges laid to such civil forfeiture laws have been dismissed as they
were usually attributed to historic prevalence of such forfeiture laws.
However, such historic reasons of its existence cannot justify continued
expansion of civil forfeiture laws, as has been observed in Leonard V.
Texas41 41 by Clarence Thomas, J. in the following manner : (Leonard
"This system-where police can seize property with limited judicial
oversight and retain it for their own use-has led to egregious and
well-chronicled abuses,"
"These forfeiture operations frequently target the poor and other
groups least able to defend their interests in forfeiture proceedings."
103. In the case at hand, although expansion of forfeiture laws
originates from Parliament's concern for decriminalising property
holdings, however, we are reminded of Oliver Wendell Holmes, J. who
has stated as under:
"The customs, beliefs or needs of a primitive time establish a rule
or a formula. In the course of centuries, the custom, belief, or
necessity disappears, but the rule remains. The reason which gave
rise to the rule has been forgotten, and ingenious minds set
themselves to enquire how it is to be accounted for. Some ground of
policy is thought of, which seems to explain it and to reconcile it
with the present state of things; and then the rule adapts itself to
the new reasons which have been found for it, and enters on a new
career. The old form receives a new content and in time even the
1442
form modifies itself to it for the meaning which it has received.
104. While categorising the forfeiture proceedings as civil or
criminal, the tests laid down by the European Court of Human Rights in
Engel V. Netherlands (No. 1), In re43, have been treated as giving
authoritative guidance. Those tests are set out in paras 80 to 82 of the
Report and are as follows:
"(i) The manner in which the domestic State classifies the
proceedings. This normally carries comparatively little weight and is
regarded as a starting point rather than determinative - see Ozturk
V. Germany44, , EHRR at pp. 421-422.
(ii) The nature of the conduct in question classified objectively
bearing in mind the object and purpose of the Convention.
(iii) The severity of any possible penalty-severe penalties,
including those with imprisonment in default and penalties intended
to deter
are pointers towards a criminal classification of proceedings - see
Schmautzer V. Austria45
In Lauko V. Slovakia46 the Court observed that these criteria were
alternatives and not cumulative although a cumulative approach
might be adopted where a separate analysis of each criterion did not
make it possible to reach a clear conclusion as to the existence of a
'criminal charge'."
(emphasis supplied)
The aforesaid proposition has also been confirmed by the House of
Lords in R. V. H47.
105. In Kennedy V. Mendoza-Martinez40, the Supreme Court of the
United States, while concerned with the constitutionality of legislation
that imposed forfeiture of citizenship on those who had left or remained
outside the United States during wartime to evade military service, had
laid down the following relevant factors to classify forfeiture law:
(a) Whether the sanction involves an affirmative disability or
restraint;
(b) Whether it has been historically regarded as a punishment;
(c) Whether it is only applicable where there has been a finding of
scienter (that is, a finding that an act has been done knowingly and
intentionally);
(d) Whether its operation promotes the traditional retributive and
deterrent aims of punishment;
(e) Whether the behaviour to which the statute applies is already
a crime;
(f) Whether an alternative purpose to which it may be rationally
connected is attributable to it; and
(g) Whether it appears excessive in light of the alternative
purpose assigned.
106. Coming to the Indian case laws, in State of W.B. V. S.K.
Ghosh4 , this Court was concerned with the Criminal Law Amendment
Ordinance 38 of 1944, wherein the law provided only for attachment of
the property, after conviction is given effect to. Unlike the present law,
the taint on the property is squarely determined by the criminal court
deciding the criminal conviction. Confiscation contemplated under
Section 13 of the Criminal Law Amendment Ordinance 38 of 1944 could
only be given effect to after the verdict of guilty by the criminal court.
In the light of such unique provisions, the Court characterised such
forfeiture laws as civil in nature. We may note that such a law did not
contemplate an independent confiscation proceeding as created under
this law, rather, a mechanism was devised to confiscate a property after
criminal conviction.
107. This Court, while noting that forfeiture is no doubt punitive
under Article 20(1) of the Constitution as it is one of the punishments
prescribed under Section 53 IPC, held that Section 13(3) of the
Criminal Law Amendment Ordinance 38 of 1944 was not punitive as the
same was dependent on prior criminal prosecution and determination of
amount which was to be forfeited in the following manner : (S.K. Ghosh
case4 , AIR pp. 261-62, paras 11 & 13)
"11. Further what Section 13(3) of the 1944 Ordinance which
provides for forfeiture requires is that there should be in the final
judgment of the criminal court a finding as to the amount of money
or value of property in pursuance of Section 12. As soon as that
finding is there, the District Judge would know the amount he is to
forfeit, and the purpose of the finding is that if the District Judge is
asked to make a forfeiture under Section 13(3) he should know
exactly the amount which he is required to forfeit. So long therefore
as the criminal court trying an offender has given a finding as to the
amount of money or value of other property procured by means of
the offence in the judgment that in our opinion is sufficient
compliance with Section 12(1) of the 1944 Ordinance and the
requirement therein that it should be on the representation of the
prosecution is a mere formality. Obviously, even a determination
under Section 10 of the 1943 Ordinance as amended in 1945 of the
amount procured by the offence must be at the instance of the
prosecution for it is the prosecution which will provide the material
for that determination which in turn will be the basis on which the
fine will be determined by the court under Section 10.
*
*
*
13. This brings us to the contention which found favour with
Bhattacharya, J., namely, that the provision of Section 13(3) is a
punishment and that as the 1944 Ordinance was not in force at the
time when the offence was committed Section 13(3) could not be
applied to the respondent inasmuch as Article 20(1) lays down that
no person shall be subjected to a penalty greater than that which
might have been inflicted under the law in force at the time of the
commission of the offence. Two arguments have been urged on
behalf of the appellant in this connection. In the first place, it is
urged that the respondent remained in office till 25-8-1944 while the
Ordinance came into force on 23-8-1944 and therefore the
conspiracy by means of which the money was procured continued till
after the Ordinance had come into force and therefore Article 20(1)
can have no application, for it cannot be said that the respondent
was being subjected to a penalty greater than that which might have
been inflicted under the law in force at the time of the commission of
the offence. In the second place, it is urged that the forfeiture
provided by Section 13(3) is not a penalty at all within the meaning
of Article 20(1), but is merely a method of recovering money
belonging to the Government which had been embezzled. It is urged
that the Government could file a suit to recover the
money embezzled and Section 13(3) only provides a speedier remedy
for that purpose and the forfeiture provided therein is not a penalty
within the meaning of Article 20(1)."
108. In Divl. Forest Officer V. G.V. Sudhakar Rao50, this Court was
concerned with the power of forfeiture under Section 44(2-A) of the
Andhra Pradesh Forest Act, 1967. Noting that Section 45 of the Forest
Act prior to the amendment had a provision for civil forfeiture only after
the conviction of an accused under the Forest Act, it was felt that such
a provision was insufficient to prevent the growing menace of ruthless
exploitation of government forests and illicit smuggling of teak, red
sandalwood, etc. It was in this context that a separate mechanism was
formulated to ensure that there was no unreasonable delay in
confiscation of property.
109. It may be noted that this case did not involve a constitutional
challenge under Article 20(1) of the Constitution to the aforesaid rules.
In any case, this Court has held that the new mechanism formulated
under the amended Act was completely independent of criminal
prosecution.
110. To the same extent, in State of M.P. V. Kallo Bai51 this Court
interpreted the Madhya Pradesh Van Upaj (Vyapar Viniyam) Adhiniyam,
1969 to have independent confiscation proceedings from criminal
prosecution in view of the non obstante clause under Section 15-C of
the Adhiniyam. It may also be noted that there was no challenge to the
aforesaid Act, as being violative of Article 20(1) of the Constitution. The
"14. Sub-section (1) of Section 15 empowers forest officers
concerned to conduct search to secure compliance with the
provisions of the Adhiniyam. On a plain reading of sub-section (2), it
is clear that the officer concerned may seize vehicles, ropes, etc. if
he has reason to believe that the said items were used for the
commission of an offence under the Adhiniyam. Confiscation
proceedings as contemplated under Section 15 of the Adhiniyam are
quasi-judicial proceedings and not criminal proceedings. Confiscation
proceeds on the basis of the "satisfaction" of the authorised officer
with regard to the commission of forest offence. Sub-section (3) of
the provision lays down the procedure to be followed for confiscation
under the Adhiniyam. Sub-section (3-A) authorises forest officers of
rank not inferior to that of a Ranger, who or whose subordinate, has
seized any tools, boats, vehicles, ropes, chains or any other article as
liable for confiscation, may release the same on execution of a
security worth double the amount of the property so seized. This
provision is similar to that of Section 53 of the Forest Act as
amended by the State of Madhya Pradesh. Sub-section (4) mandates
that the officer concerned should pass a written order recording
reasons for confiscation, if he is satisfied that a forest offence has
been committed by using the items marked for confiscation. Sub-
section (5) prescribes various procedures for
confiscation proceedings. Sub-section (5-A) prescribes that whenever
an authorised officer having jurisdiction over the case is himself
involved in the seizure, the next higher authority may transfer the case
to any other officer of the same rank for conducting confiscation
proceedings. Sub-section (6) provides that with respect to tools,
vehicles, boats, ropes, chains or any other article other than timber or
forest produce seized, confiscation may be directed unless the person
referred to in clause (b) of sub-section (5) is able to satisfy that the
articles were used without his knowledge or connivance or, as the case
may be, without the knowledge or connivance of his servant or agent
and that all reasonable and necessary precautions had been taken
against the use of such objects for commission of forest offence."
111. In Yogendra Kumar Jaiswal V. State of Bihar a Division Bench
of this Court was concerned with the constitutional challenge to various
enactments such as the Orissa Special Courts Act, 2006 and the Bihar
Special Courts Act, 2009. Both the enactments had provisions for
confiscation. While interpreting the confiscation provisions, this Court
read down the same to only mean interim attachment. In other words,
confiscation was interpreted as akin to attachment proceedings. The
Court mandated that any confiscation would be contingent on the final
outcome of the criminal proceedings and the logical corollary to the
same was that confiscation proceedings were not completely
independent and ultimately had to be adjudicated along with the trial
of the main criminal case.
112. In Abdul Vahab V. State of M.P. 52 this Court was concerned
with the interpretation of the Madhya Pradesh Cow Slaughter
(Prohibition) Act, 2004, wherein it was held that confiscation
proceedings could not be independent of acquittal in the criminal case.
If a contrary interpretation was taken, then the same would be violative
of Article 300-A of the Constitution. This Court distinguished the case
from the judgment of Kallo Bai51, by placing reliance on the absence of
a provision such as Section 15-C of the Madhya Pradesh Van Upaj
(Vyapar Viniyam) Adhiniyam, 1969 in the Madhya Pradesh Cow
Slaughter (Prohibition) Act, 2004.
113. In Vijay Madanlal Choudhary V. Union of India53 this Court
dealt with confiscation proceedings under Section 8 of the Prevention of
Money Laundering Act, 2002 ("PMLA") and limited the application of
Section 8(4) of PMLA concerning interim possession by the authority
before conclusion of final trial to exceptional cases. The Court
distinguished the earlier cases in view of the unique scheme under the
impugned legislation therein. Having perused the said judgment, we
are of the opinion that the aforesaid ratio requires further expounding
in an appropriate case, without which, much scope is left for arbitrary
application.
114. From the above discussion, it is manifest that the courts have
read down the provisions of civil forfeiture to be dependent on the
underlying criminal prosecution to temper the harsh consequences
envisaged under such provisions. No doubt, such reading down was
mandated to ameliorate harsh consequences of confiscatory laws which
otherwise would have allowed the State agencies to take over the
property without seriously pursuing the criminal prosecutions. At this
stage, we can only recommend that the utility of independent
provisions of forfeiture, distinct from criminal prosecution, needs to be
utilised in a proportional manner, looking at the gravity of the offence.
Few examples which may pass the muster of proportionality for having
such stringent civil forfeiture, may relate to crimes involving terrorist
activities, drug cartels or organised criminal activities. As we have
discussed, the application of such a provision to numerous other
offences which are not of such grave severity, would be of serious risk
of being disproportionate, if procedures independent of criminal
prosecution are prescribed. We may note that the proportionality of
separate confiscation procedure prescribed under the 2016 Act, has not
been argued herein. Accordingly, we leave the aforesaid question of law
open.
115. Under the IPC, forfeiture is recommended to be a form of
punishment under Section 53. Accordingly, the Code of Criminal
Procedure, 1973 provides for a mechanism for interim custody and
forfeiture at the conclusion of trial under Section 451 CrPC (in
personam forfeiture), which reads as under:
"451. Order for custody and disposal of property pending
trial in certain cases.-When any property is produced before any
criminal court during any inquiry or trial, the court may make such
order as it thinks fit for the proper custody of such property pending
the conclusion of the inquiry or trial, and, if the property is subject to
speedy and natural decay, or if it is otherwise expedient so to do, the
court may, after recording such evidence as it thinks necessary,
order it to be sold or otherwise disposed of.
Explanation - For the purposes of this section, "property"
includes-
(a) property of any kind or document which is produced before
the court or which is in its custody,
(b) any property regarding which an offence appears to have
been committed or which appears to have been used for the
commission of any offence.
452. Order for disposal of property at conclusion of trial.-
(1) When an inquiry or trial in any criminal court is concluded, the
Court may make such order as it thinks fit for the disposal, by
destruction, confiscation or delivery to any person claiming to be
entitled to possession thereof or otherwise, of any property or
document produced before it or in its custody, or regarding which
any offence appears to have been committed, or which has been
used for the commission of any offence."
The aforesaid provisions under the CrPC have inbuilt safeguards of in
personam criminal forfeiture, wherein confiscation occurs at the end of
the trial. Under these provisions, confiscation is to be determined at an
evidential standard of "beyond reasonable doubt" and are dependent on
the result of the criminal trial.
116. Coming to the Benami Act post the amendment, the interplay
of Sections 27(3), (5) and 67 of the 2016 Act creates a confiscation
procedure which is distinct from the procedure contemplated under the
CrPC or any other enactment till now in India. This separation of the
confiscation mechanism is not merely procedural. It has also altered
substantive rights of the evidentiary standards from "beyond
reasonable doubt" to "preponderance of probabilities". Such a change of
standards cannot be merely termed as procedural.
117. Characterisation of the confiscation proceedings under Chapter
IV of the 2016 Act as civil may therefore not be appropriate. There is an
implicit recognition of the forfeiture being a punitive sanction, as the
officer is mandated to build a case against the accused for such
confiscation, wherein the presumption of innocence is upheld
structurally. Being a punitive provision, it is trite that one integrates
the "presumption of innocence" within the Chapter as the same forms a
part of the fundamental right. 54
118. Additionally, the 2016 Act now condemns not only those
transactions which were traditionally denominated as benami, rather a
new class of fictitious and sham transactions are also covered under the
same. In this regard, we may notice that the intention of the legislature
is to condemn such property and there is an implicit effort by
Parliament to take into consideration the fact that such transactions are
often acquired from ill-gotten wealth. These proceedings cannot be
equated as enforcing civil obligations as, for example, correcting
deficiencies in the title. It goes further and the taint attaches to the
proceeds as well.
119. In view of the above discussion, it is manifest that the 2016
Act contemplates an in rem forfeiture, wherein the taint of entering into
such a benami transaction is transposed to the asset itself and the
same becomes liable to confiscation. At the cost of repetition, we may
note that the taint of benami transactions is not restricted to the person
who is entering into the aforesaid transaction, rather, it attaches itself
to the property perpetually and extends itself to all proceeds arising
from such a property, unless the defence of innocent ownership is
established under Section 27(2) of the 2016 Act. When such a taint is
being created not on the individual, but on the property itself, a
retroactive law would characterise itself as punitive for condemning the
proceeds of sale which may also involve legitimate means of addition of
wealth.
120. Jurisprudentially, a law may enable forfeiture of property by
peculiar reason of its circumstances, of it being dangerous to the
community by reasons of any form or position that it assumes. In such
cases, forfeiture is not deemed to be punishment inflicted on its owner.
By contrast, if the law provides that the Government shall forfeit a
property A for, (1) what was carried on in property B, or (2) what the
owner does in a matter not connected with property A or (3) a bare
intent which does not necessarily relate to the conduct in property A, in
such cases, forfeiture is punishment without any exception. In this
case, the property may not be inherently dangerous or denigrate any
standard of morality. It is just the condemnation of the method of
transfer and holding, which was once a recognised form of property
holding in India. In such a case, the in rem civil proceeding utilised
retroactively, would characterise itself as penal.
121. In the case at hand, the authority that initiates such
confiscation, is granted extensive powers of discovery, inspection,
compelling attendance, compelling production of documents. They are
further empowered to take the assistance of Police Officers, Customs
Officers, Income Tax Officers and other relevant officers for furnishing
information. It is also pertinent to note that any person who fails to
furnish information, is subjected to a penalty of Rs 25,000 (Rupees
twenty-five thousand) under Section 54-A. It is also necessary to note
that a person who supplies false information before any authority, is
subjected to rigorous imprisonment of up to 5 years under Section 54
of the 2016 Act.
122. This Court is aware of the fact that the "Right to Property" is
not a fundamental right, rather it is a constitutional right that can be
abridged by law. However, this Court is not concerned with the
constitutionality of such a measure, wherein such considerations have
to be balanced. Rather, the focus is only on the characterisation of
retroactive confiscation, which in these facts and circumstances, is
punitive.
123. In view of the fact that this Court has already held that the
criminal provisions under the 1988 Act were arbitrary and incapable of
application, the law through the 2016 Amendment could not
retroactively apply for confiscation of those transactions entered into
between 5-9-1988 to 25-10-2016 as the same would tantamount to
punitive punishment, in the absence of any other form of punishment.
It is in this unique circumstance that confiscation contemplated under
the period between 5-9-1988 and 25-10-2016 would characterise itself
as punitive, if such confiscation is allowed retroactively.
124. Usually, when confiscation is enforced retroactively, the logical
reason for accepting such an action would be that the continuation of
such a property or instrument, would be dangerous for the community
to be left free in circulation. In R. V. Jia Jin He55 , where Collins, J. had
stated thus : (EWHC para 52)
"52. In Mudie56 56 , at QB p. 1254, in the judgment of Laws, LJ., who
gave the only reasoned judgment, there is set out the citation from
Butler which reads, so far as material, as follows : (Mudie case 56
QB p. 1254, para 28)
`28.
" It is the applicant's contention that the forfeiture of
his money in reality represented a severe criminal sanction,
handed down in the absence of the procedural guarantees
afforded to him under Article 6 of the Convention, in particular his
right to be presumed innocence [sic]. The court does not accept
that view. In its opinion, the forfeiture order was a preventive
measure and cannot be compared to a criminal sanction, since it
was designed to take out of circulation money which was
presumed to be bound up with the international trade in illicit
drugs. It follows that the proceedings which led to the making of
the order did not involve the determination of a criminal charge
(see Raimondo V. Italy58, EHRR at p. 264, para 43; and more
recently Arcuri V. Italy59, inadmissibility decision of 5-7-2001...
125. When we come to the present enactment, history points to a
different story wherein benami transactions were an accepted form of
holding in our country. In fact, the Privy Council had, at one point of
time, praised the sui generis evolution of the doctrine of trust in the
Indian law. The response by the Government and the Law Commission
to curb benami transactions was also not sufficient as it was conceded
before this Court that Sections 3 and 5 of the 1988 Act in reality,
dehors the legality, remained only on paper and were never
implemented on ground. Any attempt by the legislature to impose such
restrictions retroactively would no doubt be susceptible to prohibitions
under Article 20(1) of the Constitution.
126. Looked at from a different angle, continuation of only the civil
provisions under Section 4, etc. would mean that the legislative
intention was to ensure that the ostensible owner would continue to
have full ownership over the property, without allowing the real owner
to interfere with the rights of benamidar. If that be the case, then
without any effective enforcement proceedings for a long span of time,
the rights that have crystallised since 1988, would be in jeopardy. Such
implied intrusion into the right to property cannot be permitted to
operate retroactively, as that would be unduly harsh and arbitrary.
Conclusion
127. In view of the above discussion, we hold as under:
127.1. Section 3(2) (sic Section 3) of the unamended 1988 Act is
declared as unconstitutional for being manifestly arbitrary. Accordingly,
Section 3(2) of the 2016 Act is also unconstitutional as it is violative of
Article 20(1) of the Constitution.
127.2. In rem forfeiture provision under Section 5 of the unamended
1988 Act, prior to the 2016 Amendment Act, was unconstitutional for
being manifestly arbitrary.
127.3. The 2016 Amendment Act was not merely procedural, rather,
prescribed substantive provisions.
127.4. In rem forfeiture provision under Section 5 of the 2016 Act,
being punitive in nature, can only be applied prospectively and not
retroactively.
127.5. The authorities concerned cannot initiate or continue criminal
prosecution or confiscation proceedings for transactions entered into
prior to the coming into force of the 2016 Act viz. 25-10-2016. As a
consequence of the above declaration, all such prosecutions or
confiscation proceedings shall stand quashed.
127.6. As this Court is not concerned with the constitutionality of
such independent forfeiture proceedings contemplated under the 2016
Amendment Act on the other grounds, the aforesaid questions are left
open to be adjudicated in appropriate proceedings.
128. The appeal is disposed of in the above terms.
