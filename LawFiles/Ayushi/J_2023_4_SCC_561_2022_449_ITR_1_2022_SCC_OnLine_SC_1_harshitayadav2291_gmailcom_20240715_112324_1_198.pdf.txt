A. Income Tax Act, 1961 - S. 2(15) [as amended in 2008 and then by
the Finance Act, 2011 (w.e.f. 1-4-2012) and the Finance Act, 2015 (w.e.f. 1
-4-2016)] - Exemption vis-Ã -vis charitable purpose of advancement of any
other object of general public utility (GPU) - Conditions required to be
satisfied, for entitlement to - Trade, commerce, or business or any services
in relation thereto - When and extent to which permissible by GPU - Law
clarified
- Held, the law on tax exemption on grounds of charitable purpose has
been completely transformed by the abovesaid amendments to S. 2(15) in
2008, 2011 and 2015, and the law on this issue must be interpreted on the
basis of the statutory provisions as they stand after the abovesaid
amendments - Thus, further held, the "predominant object" jurisprudence
stands completely superseded by the abovesaid amendments
- The test of the charity being driven by a predominant object is no
longer good law - Therefore, the idea of a predominant object among
several other objects, is discarded - Likewise, the ambiguity with respect
to the kind of activities generating profit which could feed the main object
and incidental profit-making, also is not good law - What instead, the
definition under S. 2(15) through its proviso directs and thereby marks a
departure from the previous law, is:
- Firstly that if a GPU charity is to engage in any activity in the nature of
trade, commerce or business, for consideration it should only be a part of this
actual function to attain the GPU objective, and
- Secondly, and the equally important consideration is the imposition of a
quantitative standard i.e. income (fees, cess or other consideration) derived
from activity in the nature of trade, business or commerce or service in relation
to these three activities, should not exceed the quantitative limit as prescribed in
the proviso to S. 2(15)
- Lastly, the "ploughing" back of business income to "feed" charity is an
irrelevant factor, again emphasising the prohibition from engaging in trade,
commerce or business
- Thus held, an assessee advancing GPU cannot engage itself in any
trade, commerce or business, or provide service in relation thereto for any
consideration ("cess, or fee, or any other consideration") - However, in the
course of achieving the object of general public utility, the person or body
concerned, can carry on trade, commerce or business or provide services in
relation thereto for consideration, provided that [as per S. 2(15) proviso as
it finally stands w.e.f. 1-4-2016]:
- (1) That such activities in the nature of trade, commerce, business or
service (in relation to trade, commerce or business for consideration) should be
in the course of "actual carrying on" of the GPU object
- (2) The quantum of receipts from such activities should not exceed 20%
of the total receipts
- (3) Both parts of the proviso : (i) and (ii) [to S. 2(15)] have to be read
conjunctively, given the conscious use of "or" connecting the two of them -
This means that if a charitable trust carries on any activity in the nature of
business, trade or commerce, in the actual course of fulfilling its objectives, the
income from such business, should not exceed the limit defined in sub-clause (ii)
of the proviso
- Income Tax - Charitable Purpose/Charitable Trust
B. Income Tax Act, 1961 - S. 2(15) [as amended in 2008 and then by
the Finance Act, 2011 (w.e.f. 1-4-2012) and the Finance Act, 2015 (w.e.f. 1
-4-2016)] - "Trade, commerce, or business or any services in relation
thereto" by general public utility (GPU) - Activity in question when
amounts to - Charges in relation to such activity - When fall within
mischief of "cess, or fee, or any other consideration" - Determination of -
Principles clarified
- Charging of any amount towards consideration for advancing GPU, on cost-
basis or nominally above cost - Held, does not amount to trade, commerce,
business or provision of services in relation thereto - Generally, the charging of any
amount towards consideration for such an activity (advancing GPU), which is on
cost-basis or nominally above cost, cannot be considered to be "trade, commerce,
or business" or any services in relation thereto - It is only when the charges are
markedly or significantly above the cost incurred by the assessee in question, that
they would fall within the mischief of "cess, or fee, or any other consideration"
towards "trade, commerce or business"
- Words and Phrases - "Cess, or fee, or any other consideration", "trade,
commerce or business"
C. Income Tax Act, 1961 - Ss. 2(15) and 11(4-A) and S. 13(8), S. 10
(23-C) proviso 17 & S. 143(3) proviso 3 [w.r.e.f. 1-4-2009] - Harmonious
interpretation of - Use of expression "carrying on of any activity in the
nature of trade, commerce or business. " in S. 2(15) and "business
is
incidental" in S. 11(4-A) - Effect of
- Held, S. 11(4-A) must be interpreted harmoniously with S. 2(15), with which
there is no conflict - Carrying out activity in the nature of trade, commerce or
business, or service in relation to such activities, should be conducted in the course
of achieving the GPU object, and the income, profit or surplus or gains must,
therefore, be incidental - Further, the requirement in S. 11(4-A) of maintaining
separate books of account is also in line with the necessity of demonstrating that
the quantitative limit prescribed in the proviso to S. 2(15), has not been breached
- Similarly, the insertion of S. 13(8), seventeenth proviso to S. 10(23-C) and third
proviso to S. 143(3) (all w.r.e.f. 1-4-2009), reaffirms this interpretation and brings
uniformity across the statutory provisions
D. Income Tax Act, 1961 - Ss. 11(4) and 11(4-A) - Scope and
applicability of - Distinguished between - Distinction between "property or
business held under trust" and "a business carried on by or on behalf of the
trust" - Relevance of - Principles clarified
- Held, if a property is held under trust, and such property is a business, the
case would fall under S. 11(4) and not under S. 11(4-A) - Further, S. 11(4-A)
would apply only to a case where the business is not held under trust - Also, the
interface between Ss. 11(1) and (4) is of some importance - Firstly, under S. 11
(4), it is only the business which is held under the trust that would enjoy exemption
in respect of its income under S. 11(1) - Secondly, there is a distinction between
the objects of a trust and the powers given to the trustees to effectuate the
purposes of the trust - See also Shortnote E
E. Income Tax Act, 1961 - Ss. 11(4) and 11(4-A) - Property or
business - When can be considered as held under trust
- For a business, to be considered as property held under trust, it should have
been either acquired with the help of the fund originally settled upon trust or the
original fund settled upon trust must have a proximate connection with the later
acquisition or carrying on of the business by the trustees
F. Income Tax Act, 1961 - S. 2(15) [as it stands after the amendments
of 2008, 2011 and 2015] - Interpretation of - Matters that may be
considered - Held, Courts can look at the previous history of the statute,
and the changes it underwent to discern what is intended by the lawmakers
when an amendment is introduced, or a new law enacted - In the present
case, held, it would be useful for the Court to consider the background which
led to the amendments to S. 2(15), 2008, 2011 and 2015 - Firstly in
2008, and thereafter in 2011 and 2015, seeking to restrict the nature of
activities that a general public utility (GPU) category charity can legitimately
undertake - Interpretation of Statutes - External Aids - Legislative/Legal
history
G. Income Tax Act, 1961 - S. 2(15) [as it stands after the amendments
of 2008, 2011 and 2015] - Interpretation of - Matters that may be
considered - Held, speeches made in the legislature or Parliament, can be
looked into for throwing light on the rationale for an amendment - In the
present case, held, some light can be discerned from the statement of the
Finance Minister on the floor of Parliament, who answered to the criticism
levelled against the change brought about by the amendment in 2008 made
to S. 2(15) - Interpretation of Statutes - External Aids - Parliamentary

Department Circulars - Non-bindingness of, on courts and when contrary to
the plain words of statute - Principles clarified
- Held, circulars are binding upon departmental authorities, if they advance a
proposition within the framework of the statutory provision - However, if they are
contrary to the plain words of a statute, they are not binding - Furthermore, they
cannot bind the courts, which have to independently interpret the statute, in their
own terms - At best, in such a task, they may be considered as departmental
understanding on the subject and have limited persuasive value - At the highest,
they are binding on tax administrators and authorities, if they accord with and are
not at odds with the statute - At the worst, if they cut down the plain meaning of
a statute, or fly on the face of their express terms, they are to be ignored

I. Income Tax Act, 1961 - S. 2(15) - Use of the phrase in S. 2 "unless
the context otherwise requires" - Import and signification of - Explained
- Held, where the definition of a term is preceded by this phrase, normally, the
definition given in the section should be applied and given effect to - But this
normal rule can be deviated from if there is something in the context to show that
the definition should not be applied - The term "unless the context otherwise
requires" implies that the word or term so defined should be applied, but subject to
the context - In view of such a qualification, the Court has not only to look at the
words but also to look at the context, collocation, and the object of such words in
respect of such matters and factor the meaning to be conveyed by the use of the
words under the circumstances - Words and Phrases - "Unless the context
otherwise requires"
In these batch of appeals and special leave petitions, the primary question which
fell for consideration was the correct interpretation of Section 2(15) of the Income
Tax Act, 1961 ("the Income Tax Act" or "the IT Act") as amended by the
amendment w.e.f. 1-4-2009, and then as further amended in 2011 and 2015. The
IT Act visualised three kinds of charitable purposes : medical relief, education, and
relief for the poor, which are described hereafter as "per se purposes". To this list,
Parliament, by amendments, added other categories, such as preservation of
environment (including watersheds, forests, and wildlife) and preservation of
monuments or places or objects of artistic or historic interest, and yoga. The last,
or the residual purpose included by the definition - is "advancement of any other
object of general public utility" ("GPU category"), which is the subject of
interpretation in the present case.
The Director General of Income Tax for exemptions, Commissioner of Income
Tax ("CIT") in various States, and other officials of the Income Tax Department
("the Revenue") appealed the decisions of various High Courts, which held that the
carrying on of any trade, commerce, or business, is not a per se bar or
disqualification for a GPU category charitable trust to claim to be such, precluding its
tax-exempt status under the IT Act.
Amendments to Section 2(15) by the Finance Act, 2008 (w.e.f. 1-4-2009)
Section 2(15) - which was amended last, in 1983, was again amended, by the
Finance Act, 2008, w.e.f. 1-4-2009. Some other amendments too were made,
with effect from the same date by the Finance Act, 2009 and the Finance Act,
2010. With the said amendments, as on 1-4-2009, the provision read as follows:
"2. (15) "charitable purpose" includes relief of the poor, education, medical
relief, [preservation of environment (including watersheds, forests and wildlife)
and preservation of monuments or places or objects of artistic or historic
interest, and the advancement of any other object of general public utility:
Provided that the advancement of any other object of general public utility
shall not be a charitable purpose, if it involves the carrying on of any activity in
the nature of trade, commerce or business, or any activity of rendering any
service in relation to any trade, commerce or business, for a cess or fee or any
other consideration, irrespective of the nature of use or application, or retention,
of the income from such activity : ]
[Provided further that the first proviso shall not apply if the aggregate value
of the receipts from the activities referred to therein is [ten lakh rupees] or less
in the previous year;]"
In the second proviso, the reference to ten lakhs was substituted, and the figure
of rupees twenty-five lakhs, was inserted, by the Finance Act, 2011 (w.e.f. 1-4-
2012). By the Finance Act, 2015 (w.e.f. 1-4-2016), the first two provisos to
Section 2(15) were deleted, and instead, the following proviso was inserted:
"Provided that the advancement of any other object of general public utility
shall not be a charitable purpose, if it involves the carrying on of any activity in
the nature of trade, commerce or business, or any activity of rendering any
service in relation to any trade, commerce or business, for a cess or fee or any
other consideration, irrespective of the nature of use or application, or retention,
of the income from such activity, unless
(i) such activity is undertaken in the course of actual carrying out of such
advancement of any other object of general public utility; and
(ii) the aggregate receipts from such activity or activities during the previous
year, do not exceed twenty per cent of the total receipts, of the trust or
institution undertaking such activity or activities, of that previous year;"
Additionally, the same amendment also inserted "yoga" (after "education") as a
listed category of charitable activity, in the substantive provision.
The issues involved in these matters were:
(1) Impact and the interpretation of the changed definition of "charitable
purpose" (w.e.f. 1-4-2009), as well as the later amendments, and other related
provisions of the IT Act?
(2) Whether authorities, corporations, or bodies established by statute are
entitled to tax exemption under the provisions of the IT Act?
(3) Whether statutory regulators are entitled to tax exemption under the
provisions of the IT Act?
(4) Whether trade promotion bodies are entitled to tax exemption under the
provisions of the IT Act?
(5) Whether non-statutory bodies are entitled to tax exemption under the
provisions of the IT Act?
(6) Whether Sports Associations are entitled to tax exemption under the
provisions of the IT Act?
(7) Whether private trusts are entitled to tax exemption under the provisions
of the IT Act?
Held :
The provisions of the erstwhile the Income Tax Act, 1922 ("the old Act")
enabled tax exemption claims by trusts for their income from business activity,
provided trusts were created thereon.

J.K. Trust V. CIT (Excess Profits Tax), (1957) 32 ITR 535 (SC), impliedly referred
to
The old Act [in Section 4(3)] did not contain any terms, restricting or prohibiting
charities from engaging in commercial activities or those which yielded profit. No
doubt, the idea of income from business carried on "behalf of a religious or
charitable institution" being exempt, provided "the business is carried on in the
course of the actual carrying out of a primary purpose of the institution" was
introduced by amendment, in 1953. This was interpreted in Andhra Chamber of
Commerce, (1965) 1 SCR 565 and P. Krishna Warriar, (1964) 8 SCR 36. However,
Parliament clearly intended a departure, when it introduced the new Section 2(15)
under the IT Act. The earlier decisions in Indian Chamber of Commerce, (1976) 1
previous decisions of the Court, it consciously departed from them, and even
overruled the interpretation in Indian Chamber of Commerce case. The larger Bench
in Surat Art Silk case agreed with the previous decisions to the effect that the
motivation for the activity in question (i.e. for it to be charitable) should not be
deriving of profits. However, the larger Bench enunciated the principle of
"predominant object" and held that what was of importance was "whether the
predominant object of the activity involved in carrying out the object of general
public utility is to subserve the charitable purpose or to earn profit" and that such
an entity would not lose its charitable character merely because some profit arose
from the said activity.
(Para 108)
The view that prevailed, after the decision in Surat Art Silk case, therefore, was
that so long as the "dominant" object of a trust was charitable, and it did not
essentially involve in business or commercial activity, the generation of profits, or
surpluses by it, through activities, incidental to that main or dominant activity, did
not undermine its charitable purpose, as long as the surpluses or profits, were used
for the advancement of an object of general public utility.
(Para 113)
After 1-4-1984, the statute did not contain any restriction as to the nature of
activity that could be carried on by GPU category charity. Furthermore, the
condition in Section 13(1)(bb) - which applied to other kinds of trusts i.e. that their
incomes could be exempt under Section 11 to the extent they arose out of
business, if the business was "in the course of the actual carrying out of a primary
purpose of the trust" - was deleted. On the other hand, the wording of Section 11
(4-A) did seem to indicate that business activity was permissible if the objects of
the trust were wholly charitable, and such business were to be carried on by its
beneficiaries. This legal position continued, till the amendments in question were
carried out, in relation to Section 2(15) in 2008 and thereafter.

Aids to interpretation
History of the legislation
Courts can look at the previous history of the statute, and the changes it
underwent to discern what is intended by the lawmakers when an amendment is
introduced, or a new law enacted. In light of these factors, it would therefore, also
be useful for the Court to consider the background which led to the amendment -
firstly in 2008 and thereafter in 2012 and 2015, seeking to restrict the nature of
activities that a GPU category charity can legitimately undertake.

Departmental circulars
Circulars are binding upon departmental authorities, if they advance a
proposition within the framework of the statutory provision. However, if they are
contrary to the plain words of a statute, they are not binding. Furthermore, they
cannot bind the courts, which have to independently interpret the statute, in their
own terms. At best, in such a task, they may be considered as departmental
understanding on the subject and have limited persuasive value. At the highest,
they are binding on tax administrators and authorities, if they accord with and are

Interpretation of Section 2(15), the definition clause
Section 2 of the Income Tax Act opens with the phrase "unless the context
otherwise requires". Where the definition of a term is preceded by this phrase,
normally, the definition given in the section "should be applied and given effect to
but this normal rule can be deviated if there is something in the context to show
that the definition should not be applied". The term "unless the context otherwise
requires" implies that the word or term so defined should be applied - subject to
the context. It was held that in view of such a qualification, the Court has not only
to look at the words but also to look at the context, collocation, and the object of
such words in respect of such matters and factor the meaning to be conveyed by
the use of the words under the circumstances.

- on the one hand deleting the restrictive words prohibiting GPU categories from
carrying on profit, and deleting Section 13(1)(bb), and introducing Section 11(4-A),
on the other. There was otherwise no meaningful statutory change. The position
therefore, continued as it was for about 25 years, until the major amendments
made to Section 2(15) in 2009, 2011 and 2015.
(Para 142)
The original Section 2(15) did not allude to trade, commerce or business, or any
service in relation to such activities. It only enjoined the GPU charities from involving
themselves from carrying on of any activity for profit (which was interpreted in
Surat Art Silk case). This substantial change brought about by the amendments of
2008-2012 and 2015 is the prohibition from engaging in any kind of activity in the
nature of business, commerce, or trade or any rendering any service in relation
thereto, and earning income by the way of cess, fee or consideration. It is held that
the express deletion of the reference to "activity for profit" on the one hand, and
the enactment of an expanded list of what cannot be done by GPU charities if they
are to retain their characteristic as charities, is an emphatic manner in which
Parliament wished to express itself.

Corpus Juris Secundum, Vol. 76, pp. 620-21, referred to
The careful analysis of the amended proviso to Section 2(15), reveals that the
prohibition applies in a fourfold manner:
(a) The bar to engaging in trade, commerce or business,
(b) The bar to providing any service in relation to trade, commerce or
business,
(c) wherein "for a fee, cess or any other consideration" is the controlling
phrase for both (a) and (b) (which are collectively referred to as "prohibited
activities" for brevity),
(d) irrespective of the application of the income derived from such "prohibited
activities".

What Parliament intended - through the amendments in question was to
proscribe, involvement or engagement of GPU charities, from any form ("in the
nature of") of activities that were trade, business or commerce, or engage or
involve in providing services in relation to trade, business or commerce - for a fee,
cess or other consideration. The inclusion of the term "in the nature of" was by
design, to clarify beyond doubt, that not only business, trade or commerce, but all
activities in the nature of, or resembling them, were proscribed. Likewise, service in
relation
to such activities i.e. services relating, or pertaining to, such proscribed activities,
too were forbidden.

Webster's Third New International Dictionary (unabridged); Corpus Juris Secundum,
Vol. 17 at pp. 420-21 & 425; Salmond on Jurisprudence, referred to
The reference to fee or cess, is only to emphasise that even a statutory
consideration, for a service to business, trade or commerce, would take the activity
outside the definition of a GPU charity. The sense in which the expressions "cess,
fee or other consideration" are used, is that if any amount, is received for trading,
or business or commercial activity, or any services to such activity, then,
notwithstanding their nomenclature (as fee or cess i.e. that they are fixed under a
law) the GPU charity cannot claim tax exempt status. To bring home this even
more pointedly - and underline a break from the past, the application of such
amounts (received in the course of trade, commerce, or business, or towards
services in relation thereto) would be irrelevant, as evidenced by the term
"irrespective", in the fourth limb of reading Section 2(15). This is subject only to the
exceptions provided by the provisos to Section 2(15) as they evolved through the
three amendments of 2008, 2011 and 2015.
(Para 167)
Summation of interpretation of Section 2(15)
Section 2(15)-in the wake of its several amendments between 2008 and
2015-can be juxtaposed with the interpretation of the unamended Section 2(15)
by Supreme Court. In Surat Art Silk case, the principle enunciated was that so long
as the predominant object of GPU category charity is charitable, its engagement in
a non-charitable object resulting in profits that are incidental, is permissible. The
Court also declared that profits and gains from such activities which were non-
charitable had to be deployed or "fed" back to achieve the dominant charitable
object.
(Para 168)
The paradigm change achieved by Section 2(15) after its amendment in 2008
and as it stands today, is that firstly a GPU charity cannot engage in any activity in
the nature of trade, commerce, business or any service in relation to such activities
for any consideration (including a statutory fee, etc.). This is emphasised in the
negative language employed by the main part of Section 2(15). Therefore, the idea
of a predominant object among several other objects, is discarded. The prohibition
is relieved to a limited extent, by the proviso which carves out the condition by
which otherwise prohibited activities can be engaged in by GPU charities. The
conditions are:
(1) That such activities in the nature of trade, commerce, business or service
(in relation to trade, commerce or business for consideration) should be in the
course of "actual carrying on" of the GPU object.
(2) The quantum of receipts from such activities should not exceed 20% of
the total receipts.
(3) Both parts of the proviso : (i) and (ii) [to Section 2(15)] have to be read
conjunctively-given the conscious use of "or" connecting the two of them. This
means that if a charitable trust carries on any activity in the nature of business,
trade or commerce, in the actual course of fulfilling its objectives, the income
from such business, should not exceed the limit defined in sub-clause (ii) to the
proviso.
(para 169)
(Tax) 170, held, statutorily superseded
Sections 10, 11, 12, 12-A, 12-AA and 13 of the IT Act
The effect of Sections 11, 12, 12-A, 12-AA and 13 has been the subject of
certain decisions of the Supreme Court. These decisions have noticed that Section
11 deals with income from trusts for charitable and religious purposes and sets out
which shall be subject to tax. The principles that can be culled out from these
decisions are:
(1) Section 11(1) relates to application of income towards the objects of the
trust and exempts income of trusts with objects wholly charitable or religious, or
parts of income which relate to such objects. Section 11(1-A) provides for
exemption of capital gains derived by trusts. Section 11(1-B), speaks of failure
to apply income as per option under Explanation (2) to Section 11(1). Section
11(2) relates to setting apart or accumulation of income. Section 11(3) deals
with consequences of misapplication of income or improper investment, while
Section 11(3-A) relates to modification of purposes specified in Form 10 under
Section 11(2). Sections 11(4) and 11(4-A) relate to business income of
charitable trusts. Lastly, Section 11(5) provides for the prescribed modes of
investment in regard to the said trusts.
(2) Section 12 enacts that income of trusts created wholly for charitable or
religious purpose from voluntary contributions would be deemed as income from
the property held under such trust for the purposes of Sections 11 and 13 of the
Act. Section 12-A prescribes the conditions for applicability of Sections 11 and
12 of the Act. It enacts two essential conditions which are to be satisfied by a
charitable or religious trust for claiming exemption under those sections : firstly,
that the person in receipt of the income has made an application for registration
of the trust on or after 1-6-2007 in the prescribed form and manner to the
Commissioner and such a trust is registered under Section 12-AA and secondly,
where the total income of the trust exceeds the maximum amount which is not
chargeable to income tax in any previous year, the accounts of the trust must
be audited by a chartered accountant and the person in receipt of the income
should furnish such audit report in the prescribed form along with the return of
income. The procedure for grant (or refusal) of registration is prescribed by
Section 12-AA.
(3) Section 13 enlists the circumstances under which tax exemption is
unavailable to religious or charitable trusts otherwise falling under Sections 11 or
12. Section 13 therefore, has to be read with the provisions of Sections 11 and
12 for deciding eligibility of a trust's claim for exemption.
(para 170)
Distinction between business held under trust [Section 11(4)] and trust
carrying on business [Section 11(4-A)]
If a property is held under trust, and such property is a business, the case would
fall under Section 11(4) and not under Section 11(4-A) of the Act. Section 11(4-A)
of the Act, would apply only to a case where the business is not held under trust.
There is a difference between a property or business held under trust and a
business carried on by or on behalf of the trust. This distinction was recognised in
Surat Art Silk case, which observed that if a business undertaking is held under trust
for a charitable purpose, the income from it would be entitled to exemption under
Section 11(1) of the Act.
(Para 176)
The interface between Sections 11(1) and (4) is of some importance. Firstly,
under Section 11(4), it is only the business which is held under the trust that would
enjoy exemption in respect of its income under Section 11(1). Secondly, there is a
distinction between the objects of a trust and the powers given to the trustees to
effectuate the purposes of the trust.

referred to
The test of the charity being driven by a predominant object is no longer good
law. Likewise, the ambiguity with respect to the kind of activities generating profit
which could feed the main object and incidental profit-making also is not good law.
What instead, the definition under Section 2(15) through its proviso directs and
thereby marks a departure from the previous law, is - firstly that if a GPU charity
is to engage in any activity in the nature of trade, commerce or business, for
consideration it should only be a part of this actual function to attain the GPU
objective and, secondly - and the equally important consideration is the imposition
of a quantitative standard - i.e. income (fees, cess or other consideration) derived
from activity in the nature of trade, business or commerce or service in relation to
these three activities, should not exceed the quantitative limit of Rs 10,00,000
(w.e.f. 1-4-2009), Rs 25,00,000 (w.e.f. 1-4-2012), and 20% (w.e.f. 1-4-2016)
of the total receipts. Lastly, the "ploughing" back of business income to "feed"
charity is an irrelevant factor - again emphasising the prohibition from engaging in
trade, commerce or business.
(Para 184)
The reference to "income being profits and gains of business" with a further
reference to its being incidental to the objects of the trust, cannot and does not
mean proceeds of activities incidental to the main object, incidental objects or
income derived from incidental activities. The proper way of reading reference to
the term "incidental" in Section 11(4-A) is to interpret it in the light of sub-clause (i)
of proviso to Section 2(15) i.e. that the activity in the nature of business, trade,
commerce or service in relation to such activities should be conducted actually in
the course of achieving the GPU object, and the income, profit or surplus or gains
can then, be logically incidental. The amendment of 2016, inserting sub-clause (i)
to proviso to Section 2(15) was therefore clarificatory. Thus interpreted, there is no
conflict between the definition of charitable purpose and the machinery part of
Section 11(4-A). Further, the obligation under Section 11(4-A) to maintain
separate books of account in respect of such receipts is to ensure that the
quantitative limit imposed by sub-clause (ii) to Section 2(15) can be computed and
ascertained in an objective manner.
(Para 185)
Pure charity in the sense that the performance of an activity without any
consideration is not envisioned under the Act. If one keeps this in mind, what
Section 2(15) emphasises is that so long as a GPU's charity's object involves
activities which also generates profits (incidental, or in other words, while actually
carrying out the objectives of GPU, if some profit is generated), it can be granted
exemption provided the quantitative limit (of not exceeding 20%) under the second
proviso to Section 2(15) for receipts from such profits, is adhered to.
(Para 188)
:
The change intended by Parliament through the amendment of Section 2(15)
was sought to be emphasised and clarified by the amendment of Section 10(23-C)
and the insertion of Section 13(8). This was Parliament's emphatic way of saying
that generally no commercial or business or trading activity ought to be engaged by
GPU charities but that in the course of their functioning of carrying out activities of
general public utility, they can in a limited manner do so, provided the receipts are
within the limit spelt out in clause (ii) of the proviso to Section 2(15).
(Para 192)
General test under Section 2(15)
It is clarified that an assessee advancing general public utility cannot engage itself
in any trade, commerce or business, or provide service in relation thereto for any
consideration ("cess, or fee, or any other consideration").
(Para 270)
However, in the course of achieving the object of general public utility, the trust,
society, or other such organisation concerned, can carry on trade, commerce or
business or provide services in relation thereto for consideration, provided that (i)
the activities of trade, commerce or business are connected ("actual carrying out...'
inserted w.e.f. 1-4-2016) to the achievement of its objects of GPU; and (ii) the
receipt from such business or commercial activity or service in relation thereto,
does not exceed the quantified limit, as amended over the years (Rs 10 lakhs w.e.f.
1-4-2009; then Rs 25 lakhs w.e.f. 1-4-2012; and now 20% of total receipts of the
previous year, w.e.f. 1-4-2016).
(Para 271)
&
Generally, the charging of any amount towards consideration for such an activity
(advancing general public utility), which is on cost-basis or nominally above cost,
cannot be considered to be "trade, commerce, or business" or any services in
relation thereto. It is only when the charges are markedly or significantly above the
cost incurred by the assessee in question, that they would fall within the mischief of
"cess, or fee, or any other consideration" towards "trade, commerce or business".
In this regard, the Court has clarified through illustrations what kind of services or
goods provided on cost or nominal basis would normally be excluded from the
mischief of trade, commerce, or business, in the body of the judgment.
(Para 272)
Section 11(4-A) must be interpreted harmoniously with Section 2(15), with
which there is no conflict. Carrying out activity in the nature of trade, commerce or
business, or service in relation to such activities, should be conducted in the course
of achieving the GPU object, and the income, profit or surplus or gains must,
therefore, be incidental. The requirement in Section 11(4-A) of maintaining
separate books of account is also in line with the necessity of demonstrating that
the quantitative limit prescribed in the proviso to Section 2(15), has not been
breached. Similarly, the insertion of Section 13(8), seventeenth proviso to Section
10(23-C) and third proviso to Section 143(3) (all w.r.e.f. 1-4-2009), reaffirm this
interpretation and bring uniformity across the statutory provisions.

What kinds of income or receipts may not be characterised as derived from
trade, commerce, business or in relation to such activities, for a
consideration
Statutory corporations, authorities or bodies
The definition ipso facto does not spell out whether certain kinds of income can
be excluded. However, the reference to specific provisions enabling or mandating
collection of certain rates, tariffs or costs would have to be examined. Generically,
going by statutory models in enactments (under which corporations boards or trust
or authority by whatsoever name, are set up), the mere fact that these bodies
have to charge amounts towards supplying goods or articles, or rendering services
i.e. for fees for providing typical essential services like providing water, distribution
of foodgrains, distribution of medicines, maintenance of roads, parks, etc. ought
not to be characterised as "commercial receipts". The rationale for such exclusion
would be that if such rates, fees, tariffs, etc. determined by statutes and collected
for essential services, are included in the overall income as receipts as part of trade,
commerce or business, the quantitative limit of 20% imposed by the second
proviso to Section 2(15) would be attracted thereby negating the essential general
public utility object and thus driving up the costs to be borne by the ultimate user or
consumer which is the general public.
(Para 194)
Interpretation of Section 10(46) and Section 2(15)
Revenue's narrow construction by which tax exemption is denied on the ground
that if an entity is not covered by Section 10(20-A) - or the newly applicable
Section 10(46), it cannot claim benefit as a GPU charity under Section 11, is
unsound. These two provisions confer different though overlapping benefits. If an
entity does not fulfil the requirement of one provision because it does not answer
the description of a body under that provision, that ipso facto is not a bar for it to
claim benefit of another provision.
(Para 197)
Section 10(46) reincarnated so to say Section 10(20-A), which had been
deleted w.e.f. 1-4-2003. This provision i.e. Section 10(46) was inserted with effect
from 1-4-2009 retrospectively by the Finance Act, 2011. The conditions for
applicability of Section 10(46) i.e. that specified income or a class of specified
income of ports, trusts or commissions, etc. established or constituted by or under
Central or State enactments with the object of regulating or administering any
activity in the general public, is on similar lines as in the case of GPU charities. Like in
the case of GPU charities, there is a prohibition by Section 10(46)(b) against such
corporations, etc. engaging in commercial activity. This restriction has been
introduced for the first time [as that prohibition was absent in the now repealed
Section 10(20-A)].
(Para 198)
The term "commercial" is closely similar to, if not identical, with the phrase "in
the nature of trade, commerce or business". The other condition in Section 10(46)
is that the specified income to be exempted, is to be notified by the Central
Government in the Official Gazette. Facially the allusion to commercial activity,
appears to be in the nature of a complete bar to activities which are akin to
commerce or business, yielding profit. However, what needs to be kept in mind is
that the object of Section 10 is to remove from the taxable net, an entire class of
receipts of income. Given this object of Section 10, the interpretation of
"commercial" activity has to be on the same lines as in the case of income derived
by GPU charities, in the course of their actual functioning, by involving in activities in
the nature of trade, commerce or business. Thus, if statutory corporations within
Section 10(46) derive their income by charging a nominal mark-up over the cost of
service rendered or goods supplied, meant to recover the costs of the activities
they engage in primarily or to achieve the object for which they were set up, such
as development of housing, road infrastructure, water supply, sewage treatment,
supply of foodgrains, medicines, etc. with or without regulatory powers, the mere
fact that some surplus or gain is derived would not disentitle them from the benefit
of Section 10(46).
(Para 199)
The manner in which GPU charities have been dealt with under the definition
clause i.e. Section 2(15), indicates that even though trading or commercial activity
or service in relation to trade, commerce or business appears to be barred -
nevertheless the ban is lifted somewhat by the proviso which enables such activities
to be carried out if they are intrinsically part of the activity of achieving the object
of general public utility. Furthermore, in the case of GPU charities there is a
quantified limit of the overall receipts, which is permissible from such commercial
activity. In the case of local authorities and corporations covered by Section 10(46)
no such activities are seemingly permitted.
(Para 204)
The denial of exemption under one category cannot debar such corporations
from claiming income exempt status under another category.

Summary of principles in relation to statutory authorities/corporations
Thus, the principles applicable to statutory corporations, authorities or bodies
can be summarised as follows:
(1) The fact that bodies which carry on statutory functions whose income
was eligible to be considered for exemption under Section 10(20-A) ceased to
enjoy that benefit after deletion of that provision w.e.f. 1-4-2003, does not ipso
facto preclude their claim for consideration for benefit as GPU category charities,
under Section 11 read with Section 2(15) of the Act.
(2) Statutory corporations, boards, authorities, commissions, etc. (by
whatsoever names called) in the housing development, town planning, industrial
development sectors are involved in the advancement of objects of general
public utility, therefore are entitled to be considered as charities in the GPU
categories.
(3) Such statutory corporations, boards, trusts authorities, etc. may be
involved in promoting public objects and also in the course of their pursuing their
objects, involved or engaged in activities in the nature of trade, commerce or
business.
(4) The determinative tests to consider when determining whether such
statutory bodies, boards, authorities, corporations, autonomous or self-
governing government sponsored bodies, are GPU category charities:
(i) Does the State or Central law, or the memorandum of association,
constitution, etc. advance any GPU object, such as development of housing,
town planning, development of industrial areas, or regulation of any activity in
the general public interest, supply of essential goods or services - such as
water supply, sewage service, distributing medicines, of foodgrains (PDS
entities), etc.
(ii) While carrying on of such activities to achieve such objects (which are to
be discerned from the objects and policy of the enactment; or in terms of the
controlling instrument, such as memorandum of association, etc.), the purpose
for which such public GPU charity, is set up - whether for furthering the
development or a charitable object or for carrying on trade, business or
commerce or service in relation to such trade, etc.
(iii) Rendition of service or providing any article or goods, by such boards,
authority, corporation, etc. on cost or nominal mark-up basis would ipso facto
not be activities in the nature of business, trade or commerce or service in
relation to such business, trade or commerce.
(iv) Where the controlling instrument, particularly a statute imposes certain
responsibilities or duties upon the body concerned, such as fixation of rates on
predetermined statutory basis, or based on formulae regulated by law, or rules
having the force of law, setting apart amenities for the purposes of
development, charging fixed rates towards supply of water, providing sewage
services, providing foodgrains, medicines, and/or retaining monies in deposits or
government securities and drawing interest therefrom or charging lease rent,
ground rent, etc. per se, recovery of such charges, fee, interest, etc. cannot be
characterised as "fee, cess or other consideration" for engaging in activities in
the nature of trade, commerce, or business, or for providing service in relation in
relation thereto.
(v) Does the statute or controlling instrument set out the policy or scheme,
for how the goods and services are to be distributed; in what proportion the
surpluses, or profits, can be permissively garnered; are there are limits within
which plots, rates or costs are to be worked out; whether the function in which
the body is engaged in, is normally something a Government or State is
expected to engage in, having regard to provisions of the Constitution and the
whether in case surplus or gains accrue, the corporation, body or authority is
permitted to distribute it, and if so, only to the Government or State; the extent
to which the State or its instrumentalities have control over the corporation or
its bodies, and whether it is subject to directions by the Government, etc.
concerned.
(vi) As long as the statutory body, corporation, authority, etc. concerned
while actually furthering a GPU object, carries out activities that entail some
trade, commerce or business, which generates profit (i.e. amounts that are
significantly higher than the cost), and the quantum of such receipts are within
the prescribed limit [20% as mandated by the second proviso to Section 2(15)]
- the statutory or government organisations concerned can be characterised as
GPU charities. It goes
without saying that the other conditions imposed by the seventh proviso to Section
10(23-C) and by Section 11 have to necessarily be fulfilled.
(5) As a consequence, it is necessary in each case, having regard to the first
proviso and seventeenth proviso (the latter introduced in 2012, w.r.e.f. 1-4-
2009) to Section 10(23-C), that the authority considering granting exemption,
takes into account the objects of the enactment or instrument concerned, its
underlying policy, and the nature of the functions, and activities, of the entity
claiming to be a GPU charity. If in the course of its functioning it collects fees, or
any consideration that merely cover its expenditure (including administrative and
other costs plus a small proportion for provision) - such amounts are not
consideration towards trade, commerce or business, or service in relation
thereto. However, amounts which are significantly higher than recovery of
costs, have to be treated as receipts from trade, commerce or business. It is for
those amounts, that the quantitative limit in proviso (ii) to Section 2(15)
applies, and for which separate books of account will have to be maintained
under other provisions of the IT Act.
(para 206)
The amounts or any money whatsoever charged by a statutory corporation,
board or any other body set up by the State Governments or Central Government,
for achieving what are essentially "public functions/services" (such as housing,
industrial development, supply of water, sewage management, supply of foodgrain,
development and town planning, etc.) may resemble trade, commercial, or
business activities. However, since their objects are essential for advancement of
public purposes/functions (and are accordingly restrained by way of statutory
provisions), such receipts are prima facie to be excluded from the mischief of
business or commercial receipts.
(Para 274)
However, at the same time, in every case, the assessing authorities would have
to apply their minds and scrutinise the records, to determine if, and to what extent,
the consideration or amounts charged are significantly higher than the cost and a
nominal mark-up. If such is the case, then the receipts would indicate that the
activities are in fact in the nature of "trade, commerce or business" and as a result,
would have to comply with the quantified limit (as amended from time to time) in
the proviso to Section 2(15) of the IT Act.
(Para 275)
In clause (b) of Section 10(46) of the IT Act, "commercial" has the same
meaning as "trade, commerce, business" in Section 2(15) of the IT Act. Therefore,
sums charged by such notified body, authority, board, trust or commission (by
whatever name called) will require similar consideration - i.e. whether it is at cost
with a nominal mark-up or significantly higher, to determine if it falls within the
mischief of "commercial activity". However, in the case of such notified bodies,
there is no quantified limit in Section 10(46). Therefore, the Central Government
would have to decide on a case-by-case basis whether and to what extent,
exemption can be awarded to bodies that are notified under Section 10(46).
(Para 276)
For the period 1-4-2003 to 1-4-2011, a statutory corporation could claim the
benefit of Section 2(15) having regard to the judgment of Supreme Court in the
Section 10(46) after 1-4-2011 does not preclude a statutory corporation, board,
or whatever such body may be called, from claiming that it is set up for a charitable
purpose and seeking exemption under Section 10(23-C) or other provisions of the
Act.

- However, this is subject to the caveat that if the assessing authorities discern
that certain kinds of activities carried out by such regulatory body involved charging
of fees that are significantly higher than the cost incurred (with a nominal mark-up)
or providing other facilities or services such as admission forms, coaching classes,
registration processing fees, etc. at markedly higher prices, those would constitute
commercial or business receipts - Further, in that event, the overall quantitative
limit prescribed in the proviso to S. 2(15) (as amended from time to time) has to
be complied with, if the regulatory body is to be considered as one with "charitable
purpose" eligible for exemption
- Held, like statutory authorities which regulate professions, statutory bodies
which certify products (such as seeds) based on standards for qualification, etc. will
also be treated similarly
Held :
Statutory regulatory bodies/authorities
Institute of Chartered Accountants of India ("ICAI") and other statutory
bodies
A singular characteristic of ICAI and other statutory bodies which can be said to
regulate specific functions and professions (including the profession of Cost and
Work Accountants, and Company Secretary, etc.) is the powers conferred upon
them by the statutes to prescribe standards and enforce them through disciplinary
sanctions. Therefore, it is held that bodies which regulate professions and are
created by or under statutes which are enjoined to prescribe compulsory courses
to be undergone before the individuals concerned is entitled to claim entry into the
profession or vocation, and also continuously monitor the conduct of its members
do not ipso facto carry on activities in the nature of trade, commerce or business,
or services in relation thereto.
(Para 212)
At the same time, the Court would sound a note of caution. It is important, at
times, while considering the nature of activities (which may be part of a statutory
mandate) that regulatory bodies may perform, whether the kind of consideration
charged is vastly or significantly higher than the costs it incurs. For instance, there
can be in given situations, regulatory fees which may have to be paid annually, or
the body may require candidates, or professionals to purchase and fill forms, for
entry into the profession, or towards examinations. If the level of such fees or
collection towards forms, brochures, or exams are significantly higher than the
cost, such income would attract the mischief of proviso to Section 2(15), and
would have to be within the limits prescribed by sub-clause (ii) of the proviso to
Section 2(15).
(Para 213)
Authorities set up under the Seeds Act, 1966 (i.e. the Andhra Pradesh
State Seeds Certification Authority and the Rajasthan State Seeds and
Organic Production Certification Agency)
The functioning of the Seed Certification Agency, is a crucial one, in those only
seeds conforming to prescribed standards, are permitted to be traded and used, by
farmers. Such standards are - in the context of the fact that agriculture is one of
the mainstays of the economy, and furthermore, pivotal for food security -
essential as they ensure efficacy of seeds and guarantee to the farmers that they
can be relied upon. The essential nature of the regulatory function performed by
these certification agencies is obvious. The nature of their activities is not by way of
trade, commerce or business, nor service in relation to trade, commerce, business,
for some form of consideration
(Para 215)
Summation of conclusions
Statutory regulators
The income and receipts of statutory regulatory bodies which are for instance,
tasked with exclusive duties of prescribing curriculum, disciplining professionals and
prescribing standards of professional conduct, are prima facie not business or
commercial receipts. However, this is subject to the caveat that if the assessing
authorities discern that certain kinds of activities carried out by such regulatory
body involved charging of fees that are significantly higher than the cost incurred
(with a nominal mark-up) or providing other facilities or services such as admission
forms, coaching classes, registration processing fees, etc. at markedly higher
prices, those would constitute commercial or business receipts. In that event, the
overall quantitative limit prescribed in the proviso to Section 2(15) (as amended
from time to time) has to be complied with, if the regulatory body is to be
considered as one with "charitable purpose" eligible for exemption under the IT Act.
(Para 278)
Like statutory authorities which regulate professions, statutory bodies which
certify products (such as seeds) based on standards for qualification, etc. will also
be treated similarly.

claims of such non-statutory organisations performing public functions, will have to

Held :
Trade promotion bodies, councils, associations or organisations
Organising meetings, disseminating information through publications, holding
awareness camps and events, would be broadly covered by trade promotion.
However, when a trade promotion body provides individualised or specialised
services - such as conducting paid workshops, training courses, skill development
courses certified by it, and hires venues which are then let out to industrial, trading
or business organisations, to promote and advertise their respective businesses,
the claim for GPU status needs to be scrutinised more closely. Such activities are in
the nature of services "in relation to" trade, commerce or business. These
activities, and the facility of consultation, or skill development courses, are meant
to improve business activities, and make them more efficient. The receipts from
such activities
clearly are "fee or other consideration" for providing service "in relation to" trade,
commerce or business.
(Para 218)
(Tax) 170, held, statutorily superseded
In the case of Apparel Export Promotion Council (AEPC)
It cannot be said that AEPC's functioning does not involve any element of trade,
commerce or business, or service in relation thereto. Though in some instances,
the recipient may be an individual business house or exporter, there is no doubt
that these activities, performed by a trade body continue to be trade promotion.
Therefore, they are in the "actual course of carrying on" the GPU activity. In such a
case, for each year, the question would be whether the quantum from these
receipts, and other such receipts are within the limit prescribed by the sub-clause
(ii) to proviso to Section 2(15). If they are within the limits, AEPC would be - for
that year, entitled to claim benefit as a GPU charity.
(Para 221)
Non-statutory bodies - ERNET, NIXI and GS1 India
ERNET
ERNET is a not-for-profit society, set up under the aegis of the Union
Government. At one time, government functionaries, including the late President,
A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, were members, on account of their ex officio capacity. The
objects of this assessee are:
3.1.1. To advance the cause of computer communication in the country in all
its aspects and dimensions with a view to provide rapid nationwide development
of the sector and technological and economic growth of the county.
3.1.2. To develop, design, set up and operate nationwide state-of-the-art
computer communication infrastructure with international connectivity directed
towards research and development, advancement of high quality education,
create and host content, express creative and academic potential via intranet
and intranet peer-to-peer connectivity among educational and research
institutions in the country and the world and make available the communication
infrastructure to users in academic, research and development institutions,
government organisations in line with national priorities.
(para 222)
Having regard to the nature of ERNET'S, it cannot be said that they are in the
nature of trade, commerce or business, or service, towards trade, commerce or
business. It has to receive fees, to reimburse its costs. The materials on record
nowhere suggest that its receipts (in the nature of membership fee, connectivity
charges, data transfer differential charges, and registration charges) are of such
nature as to be called as fees or consideration towards business, trade or
commerce, or service in relation to it. The functions ERNET performs are vital to the
development of online educational and research platforms.
(Para 224)
affirmed
National Internet Exchange of India ("NIXI")
NIXI carries on the essential - crucial purpose of promoting internet services
and more importantly, regulating domain name registration which is extremely
essential for internet users in India. A country's need to have a domestic internet
exchange, rather than depend on an international one, cannot be overemphasised.
The Union Government's object of setting up of internet exchange is part of its
essential function as a Government to regulate certain segment of the
communication networks. In the absence of a single entity authorised to register
".in" domain names, there is bound to be chaos or confusion.
(Para 226)
The Revenue's contention that NIXI does not merely carry on public purpose of
regulatory activity but is involved in trade, commerce, or business or in providing
service in relation thereto, cannot be accepted.
(Para 227)
GS1 India
GS1's functions no doubt is of general public utility. However, equally the
services it performs are to aid businesses manufactures, tradesmen and
commercial establishments. Bar coding packaged articles and goods assists their
consigners to identify them; helps manufactures, and marketing organisations
(especially in the context of contemporary times, online platforms which serve as
market places). The objective of GS1 is therefore, to provide service in relation to
business, trade or commerce - for a fee or other consideration. It is also true, that
the coding system it possesses and the facilities it provides, is capable of and
perhaps is being used, by other sectors, in the welfare or public interest fields.
However, in the absence of any figures, showing the contribution of GS1's revenues
from those segments, and whether it charges lower amounts, from such
organisations, no inference can be drawn in that regard. The materials on record
show that the coding services are used for commercial or business purposes.
Having regard to these circumstances, the impugned judgment and order calls for
interference.
(Para 233)
360 ITR 138; Director General of Income Tax (Exemption) V. GS1 India, 2014
Summation of conclusions
Trade promotion bodies
Bodies involved in trade promotion (such as AEPC), or set up with the objects of
purely advocating for, coordinating and assisting trading organisations, can be said
to be involved in advancement of objects of general public utility. However, if such
organisations provide additional services such as courses meant to skill personnel,
providing private rental spaces in fairs or trade shows, consulting services, etc. then
income or receipts from such activities, would be business or commercial in nature.
In that event, the claim for tax exemption would have to be again subjected to the
rigours of the proviso to Section 2(15) of the IT Act.
(Para 280)
Non-statutory bodies
In the present batch of cases, non-statutory bodies performing public functions,
such as ERNET and NIXI are engaged in important public purposes. The materials on
record show that fees or consideration charged by them for the purposes provided
are nominal. In the circumstances, it is held that the said two assessees are driven
by charitable purposes. However, the claims of such non-statutory organisations
performing public functions, will have to be ascertained on a yearly basis, and the
Tax Authorities must discern from the records, whether the fees charged are
nominally above the cost, or have been increased to much higher levels.
(Para 281)
It is held that though GS1 India is in fact, involved in advancement of general
public utility, its services are for the benefit of trade and business, from which they
receive significantly high receipts. In the circumstances, its claim for exemption
cannot succeed having regard to amended Section 2(15). However, the Court does
not rule out any future claim made and being independently assessed, if GS1 is able
to satisfy that what it provides to its customers is charged on cost-basis with at the
most, a nominal markup.

make a case for tax exemption
Held :
Sports Associations/State Cricket Associations
The sense in which the word "education" has been used in Section 2(15) is the
systematic instruction, schooling or training given to the young in preparation for
the work of life. It also connotes the whole course of scholastic instruction which a
person has received. The word "education" has not been used in that wide and
extended sense, according to which every acquisition of further knowledge
constitutes education.
There is no doubt that the claim of the present Sport Associations will not fall
within "education" and will have to be examined under the fourth limb of Section 2
(15) - i.e. GPU category, if it is to make a case for tax exemption.
(Para 241)
The State Associations and BCCI are linked closely. The management of the
game of cricket is structured in such a way that this link is apparent at every match
or fixture of significance. In the course of conducting matches (which are scheduled
by the BCCI as the national coordinating body), apart from amounts received
towards sale of entry tickets, the State Associations also receive advertisement
money, sponsorship fee, etc. from the BCCI. Aside from these, media rights - i.e.
broadcasting rights to each national or international event conducted at various
locales owned by the State Associations, and digital rights (all of which are
exclusive, in nature) - are auctioned by BCCI.
(Para 244)
These media, or broadcasting rights, are in the nature of intellectual property
rights : under Sections 37 to 40 of the Copyrights Act, 1957. These rights -
especially television and digital rights enable the licensee or the successful bidder to
exploit the telecast or broadcast commercially, by carrying advertisements of
various products and services, in the media. Given that (i) BCCI does not own the
stadia, and uses the entire physical infrastructure of the State Associations,
(ii) expressly negotiates on their behalf for the sale of such rights (which appear to
be purely commercial contracts), the Associations' assertions that they only
received subsidy from BCCI, needed closer examination.
(Para 245)
It is quite evident that the activities of the Cricket Associations are run on
business lines. The associations own physical and other infrastructure, maintain
them, have arrangements for permanent manpower and have well-organised
supply chains to cater to the several matches they host. Many such matches are
not at national level and are Under-16 or Under-18 matches at the regional level.
However, these activities are not to be seen in isolation but are to be regarded as
part of the overall scheme, and ecosystem in which the game of cricket is
organised in India. Talent is spotted, at local levels and dependent on the promise
shown, given appropriate exposure.
(Para 250)
The ITAT - as well as the High Court fell into error in accepting at face value the
submission that the amounts made over by BCCI to the Cricket Associations were
in the nature of infrastructure subsidy. In each case, and for every year, the Tax
Authorities are under an obligation to carefully examine and see the pattern of
receipts and expenditure. Whilst doing so, the nature of rights conveyed
by the BCCI to the successful bidders, in other words, the content of broadcast
rights as well as the arrangement with respect to State Associations (either in the
form of master documents, resolutions or individual agreements with State
Associations) have to be examined. It goes without saying that there need not be
an exact correlation or a proportionate division between the receipt and the actual
expenditure. This is in line with the principle that what is an adequate consideration
for something which is agreed upon by parties is a matter best left to them. These
observations are not however, to be treated as final; the parties' contentions in this
regard are to be considered on their merit.

Summation of conclusions
Sports associations
So far as the State Cricket Associations are concerned (Saurashtra, Gujarat,
Rajasthan, Baroda, and Rajkot), the matter requires further scrutiny, in light of the
discussion in paras 244-254 of the judgment. Accordingly, a direction is issued that
the AO shall adjudicate the matter afresh after issuing notice to the assessees
concerned and examining the relevant material indicated in the previous paragraphs
of this judgment. Furthermore, if any consequential order needs to be issued, the
same shall be done and resulting actions, including assessment orders shall be

imposed by sub-clause (ii) of the proviso to S. 2(15) has to also be fulfilled - In
the present case, held, that percentage had been exceeded, as evident from the
record
Held :
Private trusts
Tribune Trust
It is noticed from the impugned judgment that the High Court concedes to the
fact that the Trust's activities were held by the Privy Council to constitute financing
of objects of "general public utility"; further that merely because thousands of
newspapers were being published made no difference. It still continues to be a GPU
charity.
(Para 259)
The publication of advertisements for consideration by the newspaper, cannot
but be termed as an activity in the nature of carrying on business, trade or
commerce for a fee or consideration. That the newspaper published by the Trust
("The Tribune") in this case is funded mainly through advertisement is no basis for
holding that publishing such advertisements by the Trust does not constitute
business. The object of the Trust to involve or engage in publication of newspapers.
Publishing advertisements is obviously to garner receipts which are in the nature of
profit. Now, by virtue of the amended definition of Section 2(15), GPU charities can
engage themselves in business or commercial activity for profit, only if the receipts
from such activities do not exceed the quantitative limit of the overall receipts
earned in a given year. While the assessee's contention that publication of
advertisement is intrinsically linked with newspaper activity [thereby fulfilling sub-
clause (i) of the proviso to Section 2(15) i.e. an activity in the course of actual
carrying on of the activity towards advancement of the object] is acceptable,
nevertheless, the condition imposed by sub-clause (ii) of the proviso
to Section 2(15) has to also be fulfilled. In the present case, that percentage had
been exceeded, as evident from the record.
(Para 261)
(1939) 7 ITR 415 : AIR 1939 PC 208, considered
Shri Balaji Samaj Vikas Samiti
The assessee is a registered society which was formed with the object of
establishing and running a health club, Arogya Kendra; its object included
organisation of emergency relief centres, etc. Other objects, included promotion of
moral values, eradication of child labour, dowry, etc. The assessee had entered into
arrangements with the State agencies to supply mid-day meals to students of
primary schools in different villages through contracts entered into with the Basic
Shiksha Adhikari, District Meerut. It is a matter of record that the materials for
preparation of mid-day meal was supplied by the Government. The assessee
Society claimed that it only obtains nominal charges for preparation of mid-day
meals. The assessee's claim for registration was rejected on the ground that it was
involved in commercial activity.
(Para 264)
The first consideration would be whether the activity concerned was or is in any
manner covered by the objects clause. Secondly, the Revenue Authorities should
also consider the express terms of the contract or contracts entered into by the
assessee with the State or its agencies. If on the basis of such contracts, the
accounts disclose that the amounts paid are nominal mark-up over and above the
cost incurred towards supplying the services, the activity may fall within the
description of one advancing the general public utility. If on the other hand, there is
a significant mark-up over the actual cost of service, the next step would be to
ascertain whether the quantitative limit in the proviso to Section 2(15) is adhered
to. It is only in the event of the trust actually carrying on an activity in the course of
achieving one of its objects, and earning income which should not exceed the
quantitative limit prescribed at the relevant time, that it can be said to be driven by
charitable purpose.
(Para 267)
It is apparent from the records that the tax effect is less than Rs 10 lakhs. It is
apparent that the receipt from the activities in the present case did not exceed the
quantitative limit of Rs 10 lakhs prescribed at the relevant time. In the
circumstances, the impugned order of the High Court does not call for interference.
(Para 268)
Summation of conclusions
Private trusts
So far as the appeal by assessee Tribune Trust is concerned, it has been held
that despite advancing general public utility, the Trust cannot benefit from
exemption offered to entities covered by Section 2(15) as the records reveal that
income received from advertisements, constituted business or commercial receipts.
Consequently, the limit prescribed in the proviso to Section 2(15) has to be
adhered to for the Trust's claim of being as a charity eligible for exemption, to
succeed.

Application of interpretation
710
1. Leave granted in all matters where leave has not already been
granted. CA No. 21762 of 2017 (CIT V. Ahmedabad Urban Development
Authority) is taken as the lead matter.
2. Religious and charitable trusts have existed in one form or the
other, tracing their origins to the instinct of benevolence, which is part
of human nature. Indian philanthropy has enriched its cultural heritage,
particularly in catering to the educational, medical, socio-economic, and
religious needs of the people. Here its role has been supplementary to
the efforts of the State, which has recognised the public utility of this
impulse, and granted tax exemptions. Indian Income Tax laws have
favoured charities, even granted preferential treatment since 1886. The
law, while granting exemption to income from religious and charitable
trusts has taken effective measures to minimise misuse of trust funds.
As a result, a charitable trust loses tax exemption if certain provisions
are not complied with, and if its activities do not fall under Section 10
of the Act. Such trusts also have to apply their income to the charitable
objects within a specified period, maintain proper audited accounts,
and invest or utilise funds in a manner so that no benefit is derived by
3
the settlor, trustees, their relatives, or other persons.
3. The scope and amplitude of the definition of "charitable purpose"
under the Income Tax Act, 1961 (hereafter "the Income Tax Act" or
"the IT Act") has engaged the courts' (including that of this Court)
attention on myriad occasions. The expression "not involving the
carrying on of any activity for profit" in the last limb of the definition
[Section 2(15) prior to amendment by the Finance
Act, 1983] was the subject of debate in no less than five judgments of
this Court (including that of a five-member Bench1.
4. In these batch of appeals and special leave petitions, the primary
question which falls for consideration is the correct interpretation of the
proviso to Section 2(15) 4 of the IT Act introduced by amendment w.e.f.
1-4-2009. It is necessary, at this stage, to notice that the IT Act
visualised three kinds of charitable purposes : medical relief, education,
and relief for the poor-which are described hereafter as "per se
purposes". To this list, Parliament has, by amendments, added other
categories, such as preservation of environment (including watersheds,
forests, and wildlife) and preservation of monuments or places or
objects of artistic or historic interest, and yoga. The last-or the
residual purpose included by the definition-is "advancement of any
other object of general public utility" (hereafter referred to as "GPU
category"), which is the subject of interpretation in the present case.
5. The Director General of Income Tax for exemptions, Commissioner
of Income Tax ("CIT") in various States, and other officials of the
Income Tax Department (hereafter compendiously referred to as "the
Revenue") have appealed the decisions of various High Courts, which
have held that the carrying on of any trade, commerce, or business, is
not a per se bar or disqualification for a GPU category charitable trust to
claim to be such, precluding its tax-exempt status under the IT Act.
I. Brief history of legislative changes and this Court's
interpretation
A. Provisions of the Income Tax Act, 1922
6. The provisions of the erstwhile Income Tax Act, 1922 (hereafter
"the old Act") enabled tax exemption claims by trusts for their income
from business activity, provided trusts were created thereon. The Privy
Council in Trustees of Tribune Press V. CIT5 (hereafter "Trustees of
Tribune, In re") held that the income of The Tribune Press fell within
Section 4(3)(i) of the old Act, and it was implied that income from the
press was derived from property held under trust to maintain a
newspaper, to keep up its liberal policy and to devote surplus funds to
improve the newspaper. The word "property" occurring under Section 4
(3)(i)
of that Act was also held6 to include a business too. The old Act was
amended twice with the object of eliminating and getting rid of tax
exemptions for trusts, which were otherwise eligible for it. The first
amendment of 1939 inserted Â² a new clause (ia) in the then existing
provision. This provided that income derived from business carried on
by or on behalf of a charitable trust or religious institution could be
limited to only such business income as was derived by the trust or
institution from business carried on either in the course of the carrying
on of a trust's primary purpose, or carried on mainly by the
beneficiaries of the trust or institution.
7. The Lahore High Court in Charitable Gadodia Swadeshi Stores V.
"12. Viewed in its proper perspective, therefore, clause (ia) can be
taken to apply only such business as is carried on behalf of religious
or charitable institutions which were not held under trust and not to
such
business as was itself held under trust or was conducted by or on
behalf of such charitable or religious institutions as were held under
trust. If it was intended to narrow down the scope of clause (1) so as to
withdraw the exemption enjoyed by a business held under trust or
conducted by or on behalf of a religious or charitable trust, the new
clause should have been added as proviso to the old clause."
8. The Act was again amended by the Finance Act, 1953 wherein
clause (ia) was deleted from Section 4(3)(i) of the old Act and instead
inserted as its proviso. Parliamentary intent, in transforming old clause
(ia) into a proviso to Section 4(3)(i) was that whenever business was
carried on behalf of a religious or charitable institution, the conditions
prescribed in clause (b) of the proviso to clause (i) had to be satisfied
in addition to the general condition of exemption set out in the
substantive part of clause (i). Parliament's attempt to exempt income
from business activity upon complying with other conditions-apart
from those laid down in clause (i) -was interpreted by this Court in CIT
V. P. Krishna Warriar10 (hereafter "Krishna Warriar"). The Court
observed that : (SCR p. 50)
"The legal position may briefly be stated thus. Clause (i) of
Section 4(3) of the Act takes in every property or a fractional part of
it held in trust
wholly for religious or charitable purposes. It also takes in such
property held only in part for such purposes. Business is also property
within the meaning of said clause. Clause (b) of the proviso to Section
4(3)(i) applies only to business not held in trust but carried on behalf
of religious or charitable institutions."
9. The old Act defined "charitable purpose" under Section 4(3)-i.e.
the definition as it stood just prior to the IT Act, 1961 coming into force
(thereby replacing the old Act)-a follows:
"4. (3) Any income, profits or gains falling within the following
classes shall not be included in the total income of the person
receiving them
*
*
*
In this sub-section "charitable purpose" includes relief of the poor,
education, medical relief and the advancement of any other object of
general public utility, but nothing contained in clause (i), or clause
(ii) shall operate to exempt from the provisions of this Act that part
of the income from property held under a trust or other legal
obligation for private religious purposes which does not enure for the
benefit of the public."
10. This Court had occasion to interpret the meaning of the
expression "advancement of any other object of general public utility"
in CIT V. Andhra Chamber of CommerceÂ¹Â¹ (hereafter "Andhra Chamber
of Commerce"). The Court considered previous decisions in Trustees of
Tribune, In re5 and All India Spinners Assn. of Mirzapur V. CIT of
Bombay Presidency, Sind & BaluchistanÂ¹2 (hereafter "All India Spinners
Assn. of Mirzapur 11"). Relying heavily on the decision of the Privy
Council in Trustees of Tribune, In re5, this Court held, in Andhra
Chamber of CommerceÂ¹Â¹ that GPU objects included all objects
promoting welfare of general public, including taking steps to oppose or
urge legislation affecting trade, commerce, etc.
B. The new law : Income Tax Act, 1961
11. Section 2(15) of the IT Act (which came into force on 1-4-1962
and repealed the old IT Act) defined "charitable purpose" as follows:
"2. (15) "charitable purpose" includes relief of the poor,
education, medical relief, and the advancement of any other object
of general public utility not involving the carrying on of any activity
for profit;"
12. The then Finance Minister, Mr Morarji Desai, explained the
rationale for the new definition on the floor of Lok Sabha:
"The definition of "charitable purpose" in that clause is at present
so widely worded that it can be taken advantage of even by
commercial concerns which, while ostensibly serving a public
purpose, get fully paid
for the benefits provided by them, namely, the newspaper industry
which while running its concern on commercial line can claim that by
circulating newspapers it was improving the general knowledge of the
public. In order to prevent the misuse of this definition in such cases,
the Select Committee felt that the words "not involving the carrying on
of any activity for profit" should be added to the definition."13
13. The first major decision to interpret the new definition was Lok
Shikshana Trust V. CIT14 (hereafter "Lok Shikshana Trust"). This Court
turned down a contention that newspaper business, carried on with
several other objects (which included setting up of educational
institutions, dissemination of knowledge to the Kannada speaking
public through newspaper, etc.) was charitable. The Court noticed the
"7.
The result thus of the change in the definition is that in order
to bring a case within the fourth category of charitable purpose, it
would be necessary to show that (1) the purpose of the trust is the
advancement of any other object of general public utility, and (2)
the above purpose does not involve the carrying on of any activity for
profit. Both the above conditions must be fulfilled before the purpose
of the trust can be held to be charitable purpose.
*
*
*
9. It is true that there are some business activities like mutual
insurance and cooperative stores of which profit-making is not an
essential ingredient, but that is so because of a self-imposed and
innate restriction on making profit in the carrying on of that
particular type of business. Ordinarily profit motive is a normal
incidence of business activity and if the activity of a trust consists of
carrying on of a business and there are no restrictions on its making
profit, the court would be well justified in assuming in the absence of
some indication to the contrary that the object of the trust involves
the carrying on of an activity for profit.
By the use of the
expression "profit motive" it is not intended that profit must in fact
be earned. Nor does the expression cover a mere desire to make
some monetary gain out of a transaction or even a series of
transactions. It predicates a motive which pervades the whole series
of transactions effected by the person in the course of his activity."
The Court also rejected the submission that the "profit" referred to
meant private profit. It held that the term had to be interpreted
without qualification.
14. One of the Judges - Beg, J. concurred with the majority, but
after noticing that the trust deed did not contain any condition on profit
-making, expressed a slightly different view emphasising that the
actual activity needs to be considered, rather than the absence or
existence of any condition, in the trust deed.
15. The next decision of importance is Indian Chamber of Commerce
V. CIT 15
(hereafter "Indian Chamber of Commerce"). The appellant
Chamber was a company registered under Section 25 of the Companies
Act, 1913. Its memorandum and articles of association stipulated
certain broad objects, which this Court agreed fell within the expression
"the advancement of any object of general public utility" in Section 2
(15) of the Act. The objects were "promotional and protective of Indian
trade interests and other allied service operations". A residual clause
authorised the Chamber "to do all other things as may be conducive to
the development of trade, commerce and industries or incidental to
attainment of the above objects or any of them".
16. As per Clauses (4) and (8) of the memorandum of association,
the Chamber's member could not stand to gain personally since no
portion of:
"income and property of the association shall be paid directly or indirectly, by
way of dividend or bonus or otherwise howsoever by "way of profit to the persons
members of the Association
"
who at any time are
17. On dissolution of the association, the members could not claim
any share in the assets. The Chamber, conceded before this Court, that
it
"by and large, strives to advance the general trade interests of India
and Indian without seeking to make profits for its members". This Court
denied the exemption claimed, holding that : (Indian Chamber of
"14.
The attainment of that object shall not involve activities for
profit. What then is an activity for profit? An undertaking by a
business organisation is ordinarily assumed to be for profit unless
expressly or by necessary implication or by eloquent surrounding
circumstances the making of profit stands loudly negatived. We will
illustrate to illumine. If there is a restrictive provision in the bye-
laws of the charitable organisation which insists that the charges
levied for services of public utility rendered are to be on a "no profit"
basis, it clearly earns the benefit of Section 2(15). For instance, a
funeral home, an S.P.C.A. or a cooperative may render services to
the public but write a condition into its constitution that it shall not
charge more than is actually needed for the rendering of the
services, - maybe it may not be an exact equivalent, such
mathematical precision being impossible in the case of variables, -
maybe a little surplus is left over at the end of the year - the broad
inhibition against making profit is a good guarantee that the carrying
on of the activity is not for profit. As an antithesis, take a funeral
home or an animal welfare organisation or a super bazaar run for
general public utility by an institution which charges large sums and
makes huge profits. Indubitably they render services of general
public utility. Their objects are charitable but their activities are for
profit.
*
*
*
16. To sum up, Section 2(15) excludes from exemption the
carrying on of activities for profit even if they are linked with the
objectives of general public utility, because the statute interdicts, for
purposes of tax relief, the advancement of such objects by
involvement in the carrying on of activities for profit. We appreciate
the involved language we use, but when legislative draftsmanship
declines to be simple, interpretative complexity becomes a judicial
necessity.
*
*
*
21. The true test is to ask for answers to the following questions :
(a) Is the object of the assessee one of general public utility? (b)
Does the advancement of the object involve activities bringing in
moneys? (c) If so, are such activities undertaken (i) for profit or (ii)
without profit? Even if (a) and (b) are answered affirmatively, if (c)
(i) is answered affirmatively, the claim for exemption collapses. The
solution to the problem of an activity being one for or irrespective of
profit is gathered on a footing of facts. What is the real nature of the
activity? One which is ordinarily carried on by ordinary people for
gain? Is there a built-in prescription in the constitution against
making a profit? Has there been in practice, profit from this venture?
Although, this last is a weak test. The mere fact that a service is
rendered is no answer to chargeability because all income is often
derived by rendering some service or other."

C. The judgment in Surat Art Silk1
18. The judgment by a larger, five-Judge Bench, in CIT V. Surat Art
Silk Cloth Manufacturers' Assn. 1 (hereafter "Surat Art Silk") was the
most important decision rendered on the issue. Here a Section 25 (of
the Companies Act, 1956 corresponding to Section 8 of the Companies
Act, 2013) non-profit company was established. It claimed exemption
as an institution with charitable purposes as its objectives. The objects
of the company included promoting commerce and trade in art silk
yarn, raw silk, cotton yarn, art silk cloth, silk cloth, and cotton cloth,
among
other objects16. Clause 5(1) of the company's
memorandum provided that its income and property wheresoever
derived was to be applied "solely for the promotion of its objects as set
forth in the memorandum"; Clause 5(2) directed that no portion of the
income or property could be paid or transferred, directly or indirectly,
by way of dividend, bonus, or otherwise by way of profit, to persons,
who at any time are or had been members of the assessee. The Income
Tax Appellate Tribunal (hereafter "ITAT") after initial remand to the
Appellate Commissioner, held that "the primary purpose for which the
assessee was established was to promote commerce and trade in art
silk and silk yarn and cloth". The ITAT made a direct reference of the
issue, to this Court, since a conflict existed with regard to the correct
interpretation of the residual clause i.e. institutions engaged in the
advancement of objects of general public utility, and whether the
company was entitled to be assessed as one carrying on activities that
amounted to charitable purposes.
19. This Court first determined that the primary or dominant object
of the company was promotion and development of trade in silk, silk
cloth, yarn and other such items and that the other objects were
subsidiary to this primary object. It then held that the requirement of
43, para 7)
"7.
but this requirement was also satisfied in the case of the
assessee, because the object of private profit was eliminated by the
recognition of the assessee under Section 25 of the Companies Act,
1956 and Clauses 5 and 10 of its Memorandum. It must, therefore,
be held that the income and property of the assessee were held
under a legal obligation for the purpose of advancement of an object
of general public utility within the meaning of Section 2 clause (15)."
20. This Court then held that the words of prohibition occurring at
the end of Section 2(15) were applicable to the last category of
charitable institutions i.e. those involved in the advancement of objects
of general public utility. It further clarified that the prohibition applied
to the object and not the advancement or attainment of the said
"10-a. It is clear on a plain natural construction of the language
used by the legislature that the ten crucial words "not involving the
carrying on of any activity for profit" go with "object of general public
utility" and not with "advancement". It is the object of general public
utility which must not involve the carrying on of any activity for
profit and not its advancement or attainment. What is inhibited by
these last ten words is the linking of activity for profit with the object
of general public utility and not its linking with the accomplishment
or carrying out of the object. It is not necessary that the
accomplishment of the object or the means to carry out the object
should not involve an activity for profit. That is not the mandate of
the newly added words. What these words require is that the object
should not involve the carrying on of any activity for profit. The
emphasis is on the object of general public utility and not on its
accomplishment or attainment.
The decisions of the Kerala and Andhra Pradesh High Courts in CIT V.
Cochin Chamber of Commerce & Industry 18 and A.P. SRTC V.
CIT19,
in our opinion lay down the correct interpretation of the last ten words
in Section 2 clause (15). The true meaning of these last ten words is
that when the purpose of a trust or institution is the advancement of an
object of general public utility, it is that object of general public utility
and not its accomplishment or carrying out which must not involve the
carrying on of any activity for profit."
21. The Court then went on to hold what is meant by "not involving
-53, paras 15-17)
"15.
The question that is necessary to be asked for this purpose
is as to when can the purpose of a trust or institution be said to
involve the carrying on of any activity for profit. The word "involve"
according to Shorter Oxford Dictionary means "to enwrap in
anything, to enfold or envelop; to contain or imply". The activity for
profit must, therefore, be intertwined or wrapped up with or implied
in the purpose of the trust or institution or in other words it must be
an integral part of such purpose. But the question again is what do
we understand by these verbal labels or formulae; what is it
precisely that they mean? Now there are two possible ways of
looking at this problem of construction. One interpretation is that
according to the definition what is necessary is that the purpose
must be of such a nature that it involves the carrying on of any
activity for profit in the sense that it cannot be achieved without
carrying on an activity for profit. On this view, if the purpose can be
achieved without the trust or institution engaging itself in an activity
for profit, it cannot be said that the purpose involves the carrying on
of an activity for profit.
16. The other interpretation is to see whether the purpose of the
trust or institution in fact involves the carrying on of an activity for
profit or in other words whether an activity for profit is actually
carried on as an integral part of the purpose or to use the words of
20
Chandrachud, J., as he then was in Dharmodayam case , "as
a
matter of advancement of the purpose". There must be an activity
for profit and it must be involved in carrying out the purpose of the
trust or institution or to put it differently, it must be carried on in
order to advance the purpose or in the course of carrying out the
purpose of the trust or institution. It is then that the inhibition of the
exclusionary clause would be attracted. This appears to us to be a
more plausible construction which gives meaning and effect to the
last concluding words added by the legislature and we prefer to
accept it. Of course, there is one qualification which must be
mentioned here and it is that if the constitution of a trust or
institution expressly provides
that the purpose shall be carried out by engaging in an activity which
has a predominant profit motive, as, for example, where the purpose is
specifically stated to be promotion of sports by holding cricket matches
on commercial lines with a view to making profit, there would be no
scope for controversy, because the purpose would, on the face of it,
involve carrying on of an activity for profit and it would be non-
charitable even though no activity for profit is actually carried on or, in
the example given, no cricket matches are in fact organised.
17. The next question that arises is as to what is the meaning of
the expression "activity for profit". Every trust or institution must
have a purpose for which it is established and every purpose must
for its accomplishment involve the carrying on of an activity. The
activity must, however, be for profit in order to attract the
exclusionary clause and the question therefore is when can an
activity be said to be one for profit? The answer to the question
obviously depends on the correct connotation of the preposition
"for". This preposition has many shades of meaning but when used
with the active participle of a verb it means "for the purpose of" and
connotes the end with reference to which something is done. It is
not therefore enough that as a matter of fact an activity results in
profit but it must be carried on with the object of earning profit.
Profit-making must be the end to which the activity must be directed
or in other words, the predominant object of the activity must be
making a profit. Where an activity is not pervaded by profit motive
but is carried on primarily for serving the charitable purpose, it
would not be correct to describe it as an activity for profit. But
where, on the other hand, an activity is carried on with the
predominant object of earning profit, it would be an activity for
profit, though it may be carried on in advancement of the charitable
purpose of the trust or institution. Where an activity is carried on as
a
matter of advancement of the charitable purpose or for the purpose
of carrying out the charitable purpose, it would not be incorrect to
say as a matter of plain English grammar that the charitable purpose
involves the carrying on of such activity, but the predominant object
of such activity must be to subserve the charitable purpose and not
to earn profit. The charitable purpose should not be submerged by
the profit-making motive; the latter should not masquerade under
the guise of the former."
(emphasis in original)
22. The Court took note of the judgment of Pathak, J. in
Dharmadeepti V. CIT21 as well as the speech of the then Finance
para 17)
"17.
It is obvious that the exclusionary clause was added with a
view to overcoming the decision of the Privy Council in Tribune case5
where it was held that the object of supplying the community with an
organ of educated public opinion by publication of a newspaper was an
object of general public utility and hence charitable in character, even
though the activity of publication of the newspaper was carried on
commercial lines with the object of earning profit. The publication of
the newspaper was an activity engaged in by the trust for the purpose
of carrying out its charitable purpose and on the facts it was clearly an
activity which had profit making as its predominant object, but even so
it was held by the Judicial Committee that since the purpose served
was an object of general public utility, it was a charitable purpose. It is
clear from the speech of the Finance Minister that it was with a view to
setting at naught this decision that the exclusionary clause was added
in the definition of "charitable purpose". The test which has, therefore,
now to be applied is whether the predominant object of the activity
involved in carrying out the object of general public utility is to
subserve the charitable purpose or to earn profit. Where profit making
is the predominant object of the activity, the purpose, though an object
of general public utility, would cease to be a charitable purpose. But
where the predominant object of the activity is to carry out the
charitable purpose and not to earn profit, it would not lose its character
of a charitable purpose merely because some profit arises from the
activity. The exclusionary clause does not require that the activity must
be carried on in such a manner that it does not result in any profit. It
would indeed be difficult for persons in charge of a trust or institution
to so carry on the activity that the expenditure balances the income
and there is no resulting profit."
23. The Court proceeded to quote from passages in its previous
judgments, in Lok Shikshana Trust14 and Indian
Chamber
of
Commerce15 to the effect that if the activity of a trust consists of
carrying on a business and there are no restrictions on profit-making,
the Court could assume (in the absence of something to the contrary)
that the trust's object involved carrying on of an activity for profit. The
Constitution Bench disagreed with the approach in both the previous
19-20)
"19.
Now we entirely agree with the learned Judges who
decided these two cases
14,
15
that activity involved in carrying out
the charitable purpose must not be motivated by a profit objective
but it must be undertaken for the purpose of advancement or
carrying out of the charitable purpose. But we find it difficult to
accept their thesis that whenever an activity is carried on which
yields profit, the inference must necessarily be drawn, in the
absence of some indication to the contrary, that the activity is
for profit and the charitable purpose involves the carrying on of an
activity for profit. We do not think the Court would be justified in
drawing any such inference merely because the activity results in profit.
It is in our opinion not at all necessary that there must be a provision in
the constitution of the trust or institution that the activity shall be
carried on on no profit no loss basis or that profit shall be proscribed.
Even if there is no such express provision, the nature of the charitable
purpose, the manner in which the activity for advancing the charitable
purpose is being carried on and the surrounding circumstances may
clearly indicate that the activity is not propelled by a dominant profit
motive. What is necessary to be considered is whether having regard to
all the facts and circumstances of the case, the dominant object of the
activity is profit making or carrying out a charitable purpose. If it is the
former, the purpose would not be a charitable purpose, but, if it is the
latter, the charitable character of the purpose would not be lost.
20. If we apply this test in the present case, it is clear that the
activity of obtaining licences for import of foreign yarn and quotas for
purchase of indigenous yarn, which was carried on by the assessee,
was not an activity for profit. The predominant object of this activity
was promotion of commerce and trade in Art Silk Yarn, Raw Silk,
Cotton Yarn, Art Silk Cloth, Silk Cloth and Cotton Cloth, which was
clearly an object of general public utility and profit was merely a bye
-product which resulted incidentally in the process of carrying out
the charitable purpose. It is significant to note that the assessee was
a Company recognised by the Central Government under Section 25
of the Companies Act, 1956 and under its Memorandum of
Association, the profit arising from any activity carried on by the
assessee was liable to be applied solely and exclusively for the
promotion of trade and commerce in various commodities which we
have mentioned above and no part of such profit could be distributed
amongst the members in any form or under any guise. The profit of
the assessee could be utilised only for the purpose of feeding this
charitable purpose and the dominant and real object of the activity
of the assessee being the advancement of the charitable purpose,
the mere fact that the activity yielded profit did not alter the
charitable character of the assessee. We are of the view that the
Tribunal was right in taking the view that the purpose for which the
assessee was established was a charitable purpose within the
meaning of Section 2 clause (15) and the income of the assessee
was exempt from tax under Section 11. The question referred to us
in each of these references must, therefore, be answered in favour of
the assessee and against the Revenue."
24. There was, however, a discordant note in Surat Art Silk1
-
A.P.
Sen, J. disagreed with the majority, and delivered a dissenting opinion.
Explaining how there were no restrictive words or conditions, under the
old IT Act, the learned Judge held that the approach indicated in Lok
Shikshana Trust14 and Indian Chamber of Commerce15 was correct. He
felt that the previous decisions of the Court were not relevant, and that
if the activities of a trust involved any activity for profit or business, the
organisation ceased to be charitable, and that such proceeds were
utilised for charitable objects, were not relevant. He also noted that :
"66. A reading of Section 2(15) and Section 11 together shows
that what is frowned upon is an activity for profit by a charity
established for advancement of an object of general public utility in
the course of accomplishing its objects."
para 69)
"69.
if the object of the trust is advancement of an object of
general public utility and it carried on any activity for profit, it is
excluded from the ambit of charitable purpose defined in Section 2
(15). The distinction is clearly brought out by the provision
contained in Section 13(1)(bb) inserted by Tax Laws (Amendment)
Act, 1975, "
D. Relevant changes brought about to the IT Act, 1961 (Finance
Acts, 1983 and 1991)
25. It is pertinent to note that the judgment in Surat Art Silk1 was
delivered on 19-11-1979. The expression "not involving the carrying on
of any activity for profit" in Section 2(15) of the IT Act, was omitted by
the Finance Act, 1983, w.e.f. 1-4-1984. Prior to this, w.e.f. 1-4-1977
the following restrictive condition had been inserted Â²2 as clause (bb), to
Section 13(1)23:
"13. (1)(bb) in the case of a charitable trust or institution for the
relief of the poor, education or medical relief, which carries on any
business, any income derived from such business, unless the
business is carried on in the course of the actual carrying out of a
primary purpose of the trust or institution;"
This provision had the effect of excluding or excepting the operation of
Section 11 (which deemed certain receipts of charitable institutions not
to be part of their income). The restrictive condition in clause (bb) was
also omitted by the Finance Act, 1983, w.e.f. 1-4-1984.
26. Below Section 11(4)24 (as it originally stood in the IT Act, 1961),
Section 11(4-A) 25 was inserted by the Finance Act, 1983, w.e.f. 1-4-
1984. Subsequently, Section 11(4-A) was amended and substituted by
the following provision w.e.f. 1-4-1992 (and continues to be in force):
"11. (4-A) Sub-section (1) or sub-section (2) or sub-section (3)
or sub-section (3-A) shall not apply in relation to any income of a
trust or an institution, being profits and gains of business, unless the
business is incidental to the attainment of the objectives of the trust
or, as the case may be, institution, and separate books of account
are maintained by such trust or institution in respect of such
business."
E. The judgment in Thanthi Trust
27. This Court comprehensively interpreted these provisions as they
existed, in different time periods, in CIT V. Thanthi Trust 2 where this
Court had to decide whether the assessee Trust, created for
establishing a newspaper "as an organ of educated public opinion for
the Tamil reading public and to disseminate news and to ventilate
opinion upon all matters of public interest through it" could avail of tax
exemption. In 1957, the settlor executed a supplementary deed
making the Trust irrevocable. On 28-7-1961 another supplementary
deed was executed which directed that the Trust's surplus income
(after defraying all expenses), should be devoted to purposes
such as establishing and running a school or college for the teaching of
journalism; establishing and/or running or helping to run schools,
colleges or other educational institutions for teaching arts and science;
establishing of scholarships for students of journalism, arts and
science; establishing and/or running or helping to run hostels for
students; establishing and/or running or helping to run orphanages;
and other educational purposes. The High Court held that exemption
could be claimed by the Trust. The Revenue appealed.
28. This Court noticed that the appeals covered three distinct
periods- (i) 1979-1980 to 1983-1984, (ii) 1984-1985 to 1991-1992,
and (iii) 1992-1993 to 1996-1997. This Court held that for the first
period (1979-1980 to 1983-1984), the activity of running a newspaper,
and the corpus held for it, by the Trust, did not directly result in
carrying on the educational activities mentioned in the supplementary
deeds. The income was found to only feed such activity, which was not
the same as carrying on in the course of actual accomplishment of the
Trust's objects of education and relief of poor, and thus not entitled to
exemption. For the next period (1984-1985 to 1991-1992), noting that
Section 11(4) continued to be in existence [despite Section 11(4-A)
being inserted (as originally enacted w.e.f. 1-4-1984)], dealing with
the expression "property held under trust", and held that : (Thanthi
"23. Trusts and institutions are separately dealt with in the Act
(Section 11 itself and Sections 12, 12-A and 13, for example). The
expressions refer to entities differently constituted. It is thus clear
that the newspaper business that is carried on by the Trust does not
fall within sub-section (4-A). The Trust is not only for public religious
purposes so it does not fall within clause (a). It is a Trust not an
institution, so it does not fall within clause (b). It must, therefore, be
held that for the assessment years in question the Trust was not
entitled to the exemption contained in Section 11 in respect of the
income of its newspaper."
29. For the third period (1992-1993 to 1996-1997), the Court dealt
with the meaning and effect of Section 11(4-A) (amended and
substituted w.e.f. 1-4-1992) and held that the assessee Trust was
para 23)
"25. The substituted sub-section (4-A) states that the income
derived from a business held under trust wholly for charitable or
religious purposes shall not be included in the total income of the
previous year of the trust or institution if "the business is incidental
to the attainment of the objective of the trust or, as the case may
be, institution" and separate books of account are maintained in
respect of such business. Clearly, the scope of sub-section (4-A) is
more beneficial to a trust or institution than was the scope of sub-
section (4-A) as originally enacted. In fact, it seems to us that the
substituted sub-section (4-A) gives a trust or institution a greater
benefit than was given by Section 13(1)(bb). If the object of
Parliament was
to give trusts and institutions no more benefit than that given by
Section 13(1)(bb), the language of Section 13(1)(bb) would have been
employed in the substituted sub-section (4-A). As it stands, all that it
requires for the business income of a trust or institution to be exempt is
that the business should be incidental to the attainment of the
objectives of the trust or institution. A business whose income is
utilised by the trust or the institution for the purposes of achieving the
objectives of the trust or the institution is, surely, a business which is
incidental to the attainment of the objectives of the trust. In any event,
if there be any ambiguity in the language employed, the provision must
be construed in a manner that benefits the assessee. The Trust,
therefore, is entitled to the benefit of Section 11 for Assessment Year
1992-1993 and thereafter. It is, we should add, not in dispute that the
income of its newspaper business has been employed to achieve its
objectives of education and relief to the poor and that it has maintained
separate books of account in respect thereof."
(emphasis supplied)
F. Deletion of certain exemptions : Section 10(20-A) and Section
10(23)
30. Section 10(20-A) had been inserted by the Finance Act, 1970,
w.e.f. 1-4-1962; it exempted certain classes of income earned by
Housing Boards, etc. and before deletion read as follows:
"10. (20-A) any income of an authority constituted in India by or
under any law enacted either for the purpose of dealing with and
satisfying the need for housing accommodation or for the purpose of
planning, development or improvement of cities, towns and villages,
or for both;"
31. Similarly, Section 10(23) 26 existed and provided exemption to
income earned by sport controlling boards, and associations, subject to
specific conditions. Section 10(23) read as follows, before its deletion:
"10. (23) any income of an association or institution established
in India which may be notified by the Central Government in the
Official Gazette having regard to the fact that the association or
institution has as its object the control, supervision, regulation or
encouragement in India of the games of cricket, hockey, football,
tennis or such other games or sports as the Central Government
may, by notification in the Official Gazette, specify in this behalf:"
32. Sections 10(20-A) and 10(23) were deleted/omitted by the
Finance Act, 2002, w.e.f. 1-4-2003. While both these provisions are not
directly relevant for deciding the primary question [i.e. as to what
charitable purpose is, under Section 2(15)], they still have an
important bearing in the present case. This
is because in view of the circumstances that the provisions were
deleted w.e.f. 1-4-2003, housing boards, and bodies, as well as sports
associations, that were earlier claiming exemption of their income
under these provisions, now sought to claim that they were charities.
G. Amendments to Section 2(15) by the Finance Act, 2008 (w.e.f.
1-4-2009)
33. Section 2(15) - which had been amended last, in 198327 was
again amended, by the Finance Act, 2008, w.e.f. 1-4-2009. Some other
amendments too were made, with effect from the same date by the
Finance Act, 2009 and Finance Act, 2010. With the said amendments,
as on 1-4-2009, the provision read as follows:
"2. (15) "charitable purpose" includes relief of the poor,
education, medical relief, [preservation of environment (including
watersheds, forests and wildlife) and preservation of monuments or
places or objects of artistic or historic interest, and the advancement
of any other object of general public utility:
Provided that the advancement of any other object of general
public utility shall not be a charitable purpose, if it involves the
carrying on of any activity in the nature of trade, commerce or
business, or any activity of rendering any service in relation to any
trade, commerce or business, for a cess or fee or any other
consideration, irrespective of the nature of use or application, or
retention, of the income from such activity : ]"
[Provided further that the first proviso shall not apply if the
aggregate value of the receipts from the activities referred to therein
is [ten lakh rupees] or less in the previous year;]"
34. In the second proviso, the reference to ten lakhs was
substituted, and the figure of rupees twenty-five lakhs, was inserted,
by the Finance Act, 2011 (w.e.f. 1-4-2012). By the Finance Act, 2015
(w.e.f. 1-4-2016), the first two provisos to Section 2(15) were deleted,
and instead, the following proviso was inserted:
"Provided that the advancement of any other object of general
public utility shall not be a charitable purpose, if it involves the
carrying on of any activity in the nature of trade, commerce or
business, or any activity of rendering any service in relation to any
trade, commerce or business, for a cess or fee or any other
consideration, irrespective of the nature of use or application, or
retention, of the income from such activity, unless-
(i) such activity is undertaken in the course of actual carrying
out of such advancement of any other object of general public
utility; and
(ii) the aggregate receipts from such activity or activities
during the previous year, do not exceed twenty per cent of the
total receipts, of the
trust or institution undertaking such activity or activities, of that
previous year;"
Additionally, the same amendment also inserted "yoga" (after
"education") as a listed category of charitable activity, in the
substantive provision.
II. Submissions of parties
A. Arguments on behalf of the Revenue
35. The learned Additional Solicitor General, Mr N. Venkataraman
(hereafter "ASG") tracing the genesis of Section 2(15) contended that
the old IT Act contained no restrictive expressions forbidding trade or
business activities by charities. He argued that decisions in Trustees of
Tribune, In re5, Andhra Chamber of CommerceÂ¹Â¹ and the decision in
Krishna Warriar10 were in light of Section 4(3) of the old Act; therefore,
the contextual framework of this Court's decisions was entirely
different. Those decisions consequently did not rule out carrying on of
activities akin to business, by charitable institutions established to
advance general public utility.
36. The ASG next submitted that Parliament's intent, in changing
the law, was to expressly forbid the tax exemption benefit if the entity
was "involved" in carrying on trade or business. The Revenue relied on
the two decisions in Lok Shikshana Trust14, and Indian Chamber of
CommerceÂ¹5, highlighting that the significance of the change -
brought about by Section 2(15) of the IT Act - was noticed. Particular
reliance was placed on the observations of Beg, J. in Lok Shikshana
Trust14 and the passages in Indian Chamber of Commerce15 to urge
that the involvement of an entity in the carrying on of activities for
profit, even if for advancement of charitable purpose or object,
disentitled it to tax exemption. The learned ASG urged that this Court
had recognised - from its earlier decisions - that the prohibition from
carrying on trade or commerce activities applied only to charities meant
to advance general public utility and not the other categories such as
education, medical relief, or relief to the poor (which are per se
exempt).
37. The ASG submitted that the judgments in Indian Chamber of
Commerce
and Lok Shikshana Trust14 were conscious of
the
generality of the GPU category which led Parliament to insert the
restrictive words "not involving the carrying on of any activity for
profit". It was argued that Parliament amended the definition due to
rampant abuse of the law by businesses claiming to be driven by
charitable purposes. Often, charities would be created merely to secure
exemption from tax, and would carry on large commercial activities,
enjoying the profits. This led Parliament to embed the exclusionary
terms, depriving exemption if the institution otherwise fell under the
GPU category charity, but undertook activities for profit.
38. The ASG relied on the Finance Minister's speech in the House at
the time of the introduction of the IT Act, and submitted that it outlines
the rationale for the restrictive condition noting that units run on
commercial lines could claim that some general public utility was
promoted and claim exemption. The Select Committee of Parliament (at
that time), felt that to prevent misuse of the definition in such cases,
the words "not involving the carrying on of any activity for profit"
should be added to the definition. The ASG relied on Lok Shikshana
Trust14 which highlighted that this statement shed light on the new
provision.
39. It was submitted that Indian Chamber of Commerce15
recognised this legislative history, and also held that the interpretation
of the provision had to be in tune with the advancement of the object of
the changed law. The Court also was conscious that there were
borderline cases which posed difficulty in deciding ex facie whether the
undertaking yielding profit is a "deceptive" device or a bona fide
venture resulting "in nominal surplus although substantially intended
only to advance the charitable object". The Court also held that the
restrictive condition was a "term of art and embraces objects of general
public utility". Yet, under the garb of charitable purposes, organisations
masking profit, sprang up. The mask was charitable, but the "heart was
hunger for tax free profit". The Revenue highlighted the following
reasoning from this Court's judgment in Indian Chamber of
"12.
by the new definition the benefit of exclusion from total
income is taken away where in accomplishing a charitable purpose
the institution engages itself in activities for profit. The Calcutta
decisions are right in linking activities for profit with advancement of
the object. If you want immunity from taxation, your means of
fulfilling charitable purposes must be unsullied by profit-making
ventures."
(emphasis in original)
40. It was then urged that before the decision in Surat Art Silk1 two
legislative developments took place, which reinforced the Revenue's
view that charities cannot engage in commercial activities. The first was
the amendment, carried out in 1975 to the IT Act (w.e.f. 1-4-1976),
which introduced Section 10(23-C) and had the effect of excluding
income received by inter alia, any fund or institution, established for
charitable purposes. The said provision, to the extent relevant, is
extracted as follows:
"10. Incomes not included in total income.-In computing the
total income of a previous year of any person, any income falling
within any of the following clauses shall not be included-
*
*
*
(23-C) any income received by any person on behalf of-
(i) the Prime Minister's National Relief Fund; or
*
*
*
(iv) any other fund or institution established for charitable
purposes;"
The other amendment was introduction of Section 13(1)(bb) (w.e.f. 1-4
-1977) which imposed conditions on the carrying on of business, by
charitable institutions.
41. It was urged that the combined operation of Section 2(15),
Section 10(23-C) and Section 13(1)(bb) meant that only charities
which were set up for the purpose of "relief of the poor, education or
medical relief", could claim exemption if they carried on business "in
the course of actual carrying out of a primary purpose of the trust or
institution". The studied omission of GPU category charities, in Section
13(1)(bb) meant that if such trust or institutions carried on any
business, even incidental to their objects, they would not be entitled to
exemption.
42. The ASG then contended that the decision in Surat Art Silk1 had
the unintended consequence of ignoring the significance of the addition
of the expression "advancement of any other object of general public
utility not involving the carrying on of any activity for profit". The
remedy intended by Parliament, in adding the said terms was to
prevent charities (involved in the carrying on of any activity for profit)
from claiming exemption, and to ensure that purely charitable activity-
driven trusts or institutions, could claim exemption. It was submitted
that the Constitution Bench fell into error, in holding that as long as the
"dominant" objective of the charity was to promote objects of general
public utility, they were entitled to exemption.
43. The ASG further submitted that if the history of the provision,
and the further amendments were kept in mind, the question of
permitting activities that had any business or trade, for consideration,
could not arise; however, by later amendments, GPU category charities
have been permitted to carry on activities in the nature of business, for
consideration, or service in relation to business and commerce,
provided that is in the course of actually achieving the charitable
object, and also that income from such activities (i.e. business, etc.)
does not exceed 20% of the total receipts.
44. It was submitted that statutory corporations, agencies, boards
and authorities may trace their origins to specific Central or State laws.
However, if their activities are akin to or "in the nature of" business, or
trade, or they provide services to businesses or trade, for consideration,
fee or even cess (since they may be enabled to do so by law) they have
to fulfil the mandate and restrictions under Section 2(15), especially
proviso (ii). The ASG cited the larger Bench decision in NDMC V. State
of Punjab28 (hereafter "NDMC") to urge that State
entities are not exempt from Union taxation, if they engage in trade or
business. It was furthermore submitted that the effect of proviso (i) to
Section 2(15) is that there can be no question of any incidental
activity; nor can the proceeds of trade claim to be exempt merely
because they are ploughed back to feed the charitable object.
B. Arguments of the assessee organisations
45. Mr S.N. Soparkar, learned Senior Advocate appeared for the
Ahmedabad Urban Development Authority (hereafter "AUDA"); Gujarat
Industrial Development Corporation (hereafter "GIDC") and Gujarat
Housing Board (hereafter "GHB"). The counsel submitted that all three
corporations were established by or under statutes enacted by the
Gujarat Legislature; they were treated as local authority under Section
10(20) of the IT Act, as it existed till 2003. Thereafter they were
treated as charitable institutions engaged in activities involved in the
advancement of public utility till the amendment of 2008.
46. The learned counsel highlighted that the AUDA was created
purely for the development and redevelopment - as well as for
augmentation of roads and allotment of lands after redevelopment, in
the areas under its control. Relying upon the provisions of the Act
constituting AUDA29 he submitted that its mandate is to control
development activities, execution of works and dispersal of sewage,
provisions of such other facilities and generally engage in urban
development in the areas it had jurisdiction over. He highlighted
Section 40 of that Act and urged that the nature of activities, especially
disposal of properties developed by AUDA were entirely regulated.
Whilst the lion's shares of properties developed by AUDA were to be
allotted for housing and residence, and earmarked specifically for public
amenities, roads, etc. a small percentage (15%) could be sold by public
auction. It was submitted that the statutory model adopted by AUDA
was to enable it to function as a self-sustaining unit. The disposal of
plots through allotment and especially by public auction were the main
modes through which it could generate revenue. The entire revenue or
income so generated was to be kept in a fund under Section 91; and its
accounts were mandatorily audited by the State's Accountant General
under Section 95.
47. It was argued that like AUDA, the GIDC too was also set up by
virtue of a statute 30 i.e. GIDA, 1962 for the purposes of securing and
assisting rapid and orderly establishment and organisation of industrial
areas and estates in Gujarat, as well as establishing commercial centres
for such industrial areas and estates. Like AUDA, its accounts were
audited by the Accountant General; the audited report was to be laid
before the State Legislature [Section 26(4)] and the land developed by
the GIDC could be dealt with only in accordance with law i.e. the
regulations framed under the GIDA, its constituting enactment, further
to Section 32(2). As far as GHB is concerned, the learned counsel
submitted that like the other statutory corporations it was also
established by virtue of a special law31. The functions of this Board
were identical to that of AUDA and its mandate is to regulate and
develop building activities aimed for the purposes of providing housing.
48. The learned counsel urged that none of the three Boards carry on
any business activity; their functions are controlled by the parent
enactments under which they were created. Furthermore, on advancing
of its affairs in such a manner that if any surpluses are generated, they
were used for furthering the objectives of law. Thus, for instance, if
surplus is generated in the activities of AUDA, GIDC, or GHB, those
would not be handed to the State Government, which previously had
control over them but rather kept in a separate fund to be utilised for
further development, expansion and development activities by each of
such corporations. These cannot be construed as carrying on any trade,
business or commerce.
49. It was submitted that the decisions in Trustees of Tribune, In
re5, Krishna Warriar10 and Lok Shikshana Trust14 were all in the context
of entities which carried on business. Moreover, in the first two
decisions, the law as it then stood did not contain any restriction
prohibiting trade or commerce activity. The learned counsel submitted
that the judgment in Indian Chamber of Commerce15 was specifically
overruled in Surat Art Silk1. Therefore, it may be treated as having no
precedential value on subject.
50. The learned counsel highlighted the observations in Surat Art
Silk1 and submitted that as long as the activities involved are mainly
charitable and for advancement of public utility, its purposes are
deemed to be charitable even if it carries on some business or trade-
like activities for the purpose of generating income. What is important,
it was argued, is whether the main or dominant purpose of business or
activity is motivated by profit. In such cases, the entity is debarred
from claiming that it is a charity and cannot claim the benefit of tax
exemption. Therefore, what is to be understood from the ratio in Surat
Art Silk1 is that the main purpose or principal objective or motivation
for the activity should not be to carry on trade or business. It should be
to advance the purpose of general public utility. If such a purpose is
fulfilled, the carrying on of some activity which might result in surplus,
would not disentitle the entity from the benefit of tax exemption.
51. The learned counsel then made a brief reference to the judgment
in CIT V. Bar Council of MaharashtraÂ³2 (hereafter "Bar Council of
Maharashtra") arguing that Surat Art Silk1 was followed in this decision.
He also cited Thanthi TrustÂ². The counsel highlighted that the object of
the assessee there, was charitable and required that the business ought
to be carried out for the purposes of achieving the charitable purpose.
Having regard to the nature of Section (1)(bb), which existed for the
relevant period, the Court held that the income which the Trust derived
was through a business and it only fed the charity. In this light, the
Court rejected the Trust's contention with respect to the entitlement to
claim tax benefit for the first part. The counsel pointedly referred to the
Court noticed the difference in language brought about by the
substitution of Section 11(4-A) (w.e.f. 1-4-1992). The new provisions
enabled the Trust to carry on business for it was incidental to the
attainment of its activities.
52. Elaborating on Thanthi Trust further, the counsel highlighted
that the scope of the provision i.e. Section 11(4-A) had been ruled by
this Court as more beneficial to the trust or institution, than had
existed previously before its amendment. Therefore, as long as the
trust carried on its activities mainly for charitable purposes - any
income derived from incidental trading or business activities, would not
result in it being characterised as an entity carrying on business; in
other words, it was one carrying on a charitable objective or purpose.
53. The learned counsel also relied upon Circular No. 11/2008 dated
19-12-2008 which highlighted that whether the activities carried on by
any charitable institutions are in the nature of trade or whether they are
essentially charitable is a question of fact. It also spelt out that if an
assessee is engaged in any activity, in the nature of trade, commerce or
business or rendering any services in relation to such trade, etc. it
could not claim that its object was charitable. In such event, "the
object of general public utility will only be a means or defence to
highlight the true purpose which is trade, service or business. It was
emphasised therefore that the circular and the speech of the Finance
Minister during the budget clearly pointed out organisations, trust or
entities which were masquerading as charitable but in reality carrying
on business. On the other hand, genuine charitable organisations which
generated income for their sustenance could not be denied the benefit
of tax exemption under the Income Tax Act.
54. The counsel relied on the decisions in Shri Ramtanu Coop.
Housing Society Ltd. V. State of MaharashtraÂ³Â³, Gujarat Industrial
Development Corpn. V. CIT34 (hereafter "GIDC case"), HSIDC V. Hari Om
Enterprises 35 and CCE
36
V. Maharashtra Industrial Development Corpn.
and urged that
statutory organisations set up for housing and other essential
development, cannot be regarded as commercial or business entities.
55. The learned counsel relied upon the Constitution Bench decision
of this Court in Navnit Lal C. Javeri V. K.K. Sen 37 (hereafter "Navnit Lal
Jhaveri"), where the Court had held while interpreting the provisions of
an enactment that the executive's understanding-in the form of
circulars in the context of taxing statutes-were valuable guides to
interpretation. The observations in Navnit Lal C. Javeri37 were relied on
to submit that the circulars in that case were used to in fact soften the
rigour of a newly introduced provision. The learned counsel also relied
upon the judgment of this Court in UCO Bank V. CIT38 (hereafter "UCO
Bank Calcutta") and in Lok Shikshana Trust14 where the Court had
specifically rejected the contention that a speech made in Parliament
cannot be looked into to discern the intent of the lawmaker. In that
case, the Court had stressed that the real meaning of all the words
used could be understood specifically by referring to the past history of
the legislation and the speech of the mover of the amendment.
56. The learned counsel argued that the expressions "trade",
"business" or "commerce" always mean and have been interpreted to
mean activities driven by profit. In this context, reliance was placed on
this Court's decisions in State of Punjab V. Bajaj Electricals Ltd.
39
Khoday Distilleries Ltd. V. State of Karnataka40 and State of Gujarat V.
Raipur Mfg. Co. Ltd.41 It was submitted that in all contexts, the primary
meaning of the expression "trade" is "exchange of goods" for money
and connotates that such activity is necessarily or always carried on to
earn profit. It was, therefore, argued that Section 2(15) cannot be read
in isolation, but should be construed in the light of the Minister's
speech while introducing the amendment, and the Circular (i.e. Circular
No. 11/2018). Therefore, if an organisation is created and carries on its
activities with a view to earn profit as was held in Bajaj Electricals39,
Khoday Distilleries40, and Raipur Mfg. 41 , it is precluded from claiming to
be a charitable organisation. On the other hand, if the entity is
primarily set up for the charitable purpose i.e. to carry on activities for
the advancement of general public utility, but it also carries activities
that generate surplus or money, they cannot be per se excluded from
consideration for tax benefit.
57. The learned Senior Counsel Mr Kavin Gulati argued for Noida and
relied upon the Constitution Bench judgment of this Court in CCE V.
Ratan Melting & Wire Industries42 to urge that a circular cannot define
an ambit of
a provision. He highlighted the decision rendered by the Delhi High
Court in Greater Noida Industrial Development Authority V. Union of
India43 , where the assessee's activities were held to be not "commercial
activity" within the meaning of clause (b) to Section 10(46). 44 He also
relied on other decisions - of this Court, to the same effect, in Kerala
SEB V. Indian Aluminium Co. Ltd. 45 and Port of Madras V. Aminchand
Pyarelal46
58. Mr Gulati relied on the GIDC case 34 to argue that the word
"development" in Section 10(20-A) of the IT Act, 1961 has to be
understood in its wide sense. It was urged that development
authorities like Noida fall under Section 2(15) of the IT Act, 1961 if
they satisfy the test in Section 11(7) of the IT Act, 1961. It was
contended that Surat Art Silk1 was clear that engagement by a trust
with a commercial activity is not per se prohibited, as long as its object
is the attainment of an object of general public utility. Pointing to the
Explanatory Notes (to the provisions of the Finance Act, 2015) - with
respect to the proviso to Section 2(15), the counsel urged that the
proviso operates at the stage of registration of trust under Section 12-
AA(1-A) of the IT Act, 1961, when the authorities satisfy themselves
with respect to the genuineness of the activity and scope of the trust.
59. It was lastly argued that the expression "trade" carries within it
the idea of profitability : the counsel cited State of Gujarat V.
Maheshkumar Dhirajlal Thakkar49 Sodan Singh V. New Delhi Municipal
Committee48 and T.M.A. Pai Foundation V. State of Karnataka49.
Reliance was placed upon the judgment in CIT V. Madurai Mills Co.
Ltd. 50 to urge that interpretation of the definition of expression
"charitable purpose" should not be coloured by considerations
stemming from legislative history, which override the plain words of a
statute.
60. Mr K.K. Chythanya, Senior Counsel appeared for M/s Karnataka
Industrial Areas Development Board ("KIADB"). He urged that KIADB was
formed under Section 5 of the Karnataka Industrial Areas Development
Act, 1966 ("the KIAD Act") and it functions on "no profit-no loss" basis
as is
evident from the Preamble51 the aims and objectives 52 of the Board as
well as Sections 3, 5, 6, 28, 29, 43 and 465 of the KIAD Act. Reliance
was placed on Karnataka Industrial Areas Development Board V.
Prakash Dal Mill54 which held that KIADB is "State" under Article 12 of
the Constitution, and it was urged that KIADB was an extension of the
Karnataka Government. The Board exercises power of eminent domain
and it performs governmental functions. Its activities, therefore, cannot
be regarded as trade or business. Reliance was placed upon State of
Karnataka V. All India Manufacturers Organisation55.
61. It was submitted that in the absence of profit motive, the
activity is not trade, commerce or business - within the meaning of
the first proviso to Section 2(15) of the IT Act, 1961. Reliance was
placed upon Khoday Distilleries40, State of T.N. V. Port of Madras56
(hereafter "Port of Madras") and several other decisions57. It was
argued that wherever it is intended, profit element is wholly excluded
from activity - reliance was placed on provisions of the Karnataka VAT
Act, the Central Goods and Service Tax Act ("the CGST Act") and
Section 2(31) of the IT Act. In the present context, the activities of
the Board do not amount to "trade", "commerce" or "business" and the
first proviso to Section 2(15) is attracted only if the primary/dominant
objects are (a) in the nature of trade, commerce or business; or (b)
rendering any service in relation to any trade, commerce or business.
To substantiate this argument, the counsel relied on Surat Art Silk1, CIT
V. Gujarat Maritime Board58 (hereafter "Gujarat Maritime Board case")
and other decisions59. Hence, if the main activity is not "business", the
connected, incidental or ancillary activities of sales carried out in
furtherance of and to accomplish their main objects would not normally,
amount to business, unless an independent intention to conduct
"business" in these connected, incidental or ancillary activities is
established by the Revenue. The judgments in CST V. Sai Publication
Fund60 and Port of Madras were relied upon. It was urged that the
Revenue's contention that statutory authorities' claim for exemption is
confined to the provision in Section 10(46). He urged that in terms of
Section 11(7)61 the Board has an option to claim exemption either
under Section 11 or under Section 10(46). There is no bar for claiming
exemption under either of those provisions.
62. Mr Dhruv Agrawal, learned Senior Counsel appearing for the U.P.
Awas Evam Vikas Parishad adopted the submissions of the Senior
Counsel Mr Soparkar and K.K. Chythyanya. He also urged that the
realisation of the right to shelter and housing is an integral part of right
to life, and contended that the predominant activity of the assessee
involves the fulfilment of those objectives, especially for the weak and
poorer sections of the society. He relied on this Court's decision in
Chameli Singh V. State of U.P. 62 which had stated that right to social
justice includes right to shelter, and that these statutory corporations
are the means to ensure that.
Mr K.V. Viswanathan, Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of GS1
India submitted that the assessee is involved in issuing bar codes
which is a global language of standardised coding and this is a
universally accepted standard for identification of products. The GS1
barcode is a global standard which is an intellectual property of GS1
(an international non-profit organisation
headquartered at Brussels) and it has affiliates in each country with the
assistance of national governments. GS1 India the assessee, is an
affiliate; it was registered as a society in the year 1996, with the Joint
Secretary, Ministry of Commerce as its President and the administrative
control vests with the Ministry of Commerce, Government of India. It
was registered as a charitable GPU category society in 1996. All the
trade bodies63 as well Bureau of Indian Standards are members of its
Governing Council.
64. It was submitted that the Revenue had granted exemptions to
the assessee Society under Section 12-A and Section 10(23-C)(iv)
while issuing various certificates from time to time (from Assessment
Year 1996-1997 to 2007-2008); therefore, it had accepted that the
assessee's object and purpose was charitable i.e. advancement of
general public utility. Also, to reflect that there is no
business/trade/commerce involved and profit motive is absent the
learned counsel relied upon the decision of the assessee Society to
issue substantial discounts to the extent of 50% to deserving sectors
like cottage industries to enable augmentation of market for such
sectors, as well as the letter written by CEO, GS1 to the President GS1
(i.e. Joint Secretary, Ministry of Commerce) to permit reduction of fee
from Rs 400 too Rs 70 per farm/plot, for issuing Global Location
Number (GLN) to farmers, which was approved.
65. Regarding the statutory provisions it was submitted that the
words "trade, commerce or business" in the proviso to Section 2(15) of
the IT Act cannot be read in isolation and have to be seen in context of
"charitable purpose" and, even after a series of amendments - from
the Finance Act, 2008 to the Finance Act, 2015 there is essentially, no
change in the basis of determination of what amounts to a trade,
commerce or business and therefore the tests as laid down in Surat Art
Silk1 still holds the field to interpret these words.
66. The counsel urged that Parliament is assumed to have used the
word "involves" found in the proviso to Section 2(15) as interpreted in
Surat Art Silk1, in the sense that an activity is involved in the
advancement of an object when it is enwrapped or enveloped in the
activity of advancement, so that the resulting activity has a dual nature
or is twin-faceted. The well-known principle of construction, that where
the legislature uses in an Act, a legal term which has received judicial
interpretation, it must be assumed that the term is used in the sense in
which it has been judicially interpreted unless a contrary intention
appears, was relied upon, and the decision in P. Vajravelu Mudaliar V.
LAO64 was cited in that context.
67. Countering the contentions of the Revenue that if entities
making profit but not involved in commercial activity desire exemption,
they ought to apply under Section 10(46) of the IT Act, it was
submitted that the expression "constituted by or under an Act" in
Section 10(46) does not include all entities like the assessee, which is a
not a statutory corporation, but a "not-for-profit" society registered
under the Societies Act. It was argued that the distinction between
"established by and under an Act" is well settled and includes entities
which are statutory corporations as contrasted from non-statutory ones.
The judgment in Dalco Engg. (P) Ltd. V. Satish Prabhakar Padhye 65 was
para 23)
"23.
when the words "by and under an Act" are preceded by the
words "established", it is clear that the reference is to a corporation
established, that it is brought into existence, by an Act or under an
Act. In short, the term refers to a statutory corporation as contrasted
from a non-statutory corporation incorporated or registered under
the Companies Act."
68. The learned Senior Counsel lastly submitted that an activity, to
be "trade, commerce or business", must be profit-driven. Profit motive
is a quintessential element and an activity without profit motive will not
result in "trade, commerce or business" in terms of the decision in
66
State of A.P. V. H. Abdul Bakhi & Bros. If exemption is not granted
to
the assessee it will face a liability of around Rs 300 crores (from FYs
2007-2008 to 2020-2021), which given its financial condition will
jeopardise its existence and functioning.
69. Ms Radhika Suri, learned counsel argued on behalf of the
Bhatinda Improvement Trust and adopted the submissions of Mr
Soparkar. She urged, in addition, that it is obligatory on part of the
assessee (a statutory corporation) to use the monies received for public
utility purpose and the price fixation of lands/plots sold by them is also
regulated through statutory regulations. Therefore, such activities
qualify the test of general public utility. Ms Suri also relied on the
decision of the Delhi High Court in Greater Noida Industrial
Development Authority43 to the effect that there is need to distinguish
commercial activity which constitutes disqualification under clause (b)
to Section 10(46) of the Act, and charging and payment of fee, service
charges, reimbursement of costs or consideration for transfer of rights
for performing and undertaking regulatory or administrative duties for
general public interest, when these are not guided and undertaken with
profit motive or intent. Further, reliance was placed on CIT V.
Hoshiarpur Improvement Trust67 to explain the characteristics of the
assessee. The learned counsel further laid emphasis on provisions of
the Regulations under the Punjab Improvement Trust Rules and
regulations to show the procedure adopted by the Board in fixing
prices.
70. Mr Gursharan S. Virk, argued that the Gujarat Maritime Board
("GMB"), is a statutory one, constituted under Section 3(2) of
68
the
Gujarat Maritime Board Act, 1981 ("the GMB Act"); it performs
functions which, prior to the enactment of the Act, were being
performed directly by the State Government69. The Preamble to the Act
notes that it is constituted for administration, control and management
of minor ports in the State of Gujarat, and for all matters connected
therewith. The Board's powers under the GMB Act apply to works
carried out by GMB as conservator of ports under the provisions of the
Indian Ports Act it is charged with essential functions such as
development and upkeep of jetties, wharves, docks, piers, places of
anchorage, lighthouses, light ships, beacons, buoys, pilot boats, and
other appliances necessary for safe maritime navigation, etc. and for
development of minor ports in general Â¹Â¹. It is also entitled to undertake
essential maritime services such as stevedoring, landing, shipping or
transhipping, piloting, hauling, mooring and hooking vessels/goods,
etc. 72 Hence it was urged, that GMB's functions are, essential and
sovereign in nature, and relate to the development, safety and
protection of the waterfront.
71. It was submitted that the GMB is not engaged in any business or
trade, is not engaged in any activity which generates profit and does
not (also statutorily cannot) use money for anything except for
development of minor ports in the State of Gujarat and the features of
the GMB Act. These features in context of the controversy at hand,
under the provisions of the IT Act, were considered by this Court in the
Gujarat Maritime Board case58 The decision discussed Sections 73, 74
and 75 of the GMB Act, which provide for management of all monies
received by the GMB; and Section 76 of the GMB Act, which permits the
setting aside of surplus money only for "expanding existing facilities or
creating new facilities at the ports" or for meeting with contingencies
caused on account of "fire, cyclones, shipwrecks or other accidents or
for any other emergency". It was stressed that that judgment clearly
indicates GMB has no profit motive. It was therefore, urged that the
provisions of the GMB Act, indicate the overwhelming public purpose
carried out by it without profit motive and that utilisation of funds is
only for the purpose of development, management and safety of minor
ports; all these entitles GMB to exemption.
72. Mr Rohit Jain, learned counsel, appeared on behalf of the
Education and Research Network (ERNET) and National Internet
Exchange of India ("NIXI"). On behalf of ERNET it was submitted that it
was started as a planned project of the Government of India under the
Department of Electronics ("DoE") with the support of the United
Nations Development Program ("UNDP"). The Program was focused on
integrating information technology and internet tools with learning
environment, to enhance the quality of education. However, funding by
the UNDP ended in 1992. The DoE nevertheless continued to support
the project till 1998 and thereafter the body was registered as an
autonomous society under administrative control of the Ministry of
Communication and Information Technology, Government of India on
27-1-1998. It was registered under Section 12-A of the IT Act, 1961 on
26-3-2004 and its activities fell within the meaning of "charitable
purpose" under Section 2(15). It duly complied with Sections 11 and
12 of the IT Act, 1961.
73. NIXI was created in 2003 by the Government of India under the
Ministry of Information Technology, for promotion and growth of
internet services in India, regulating the internet traffic and acting as
internet exchange, to undertake ".in" domain name registration thereby
saving valuable foreign exchange and take care of national concern. It
was urged that this is a Section 25 company barred from undertaking
any commercial or business activity for profit and is bound by strict
licensing conditions, including prohibition on alteration in the
memorandum of association, without prior consent of the Government.
The "charitable" nature of the same has also been upheld under Section
12-A of the IT Act, 1961.
74. The learned counsel submitted that ERNET is a "not-for-profit"
society wherein considering its objects, it receives only subscription
fees mainly from schools, colleges, universities, scientific research
institutes, etc. This subscription fees is charged on "actual basis" and
utilised towards promotion of its objectives. The charitable character of
the assessee is apparent and not in dispute since it has been accepted
by the Revenue up to Assessment Year 2008-09. Also, the final factual
findings recorded by lower authorities conclusively demonstrate that
the assessee is engaged in "advancement of general public utility", and
qualifies as a "charitable purpose" as it does not carry any trade,
commerce or business, and the income earned is not derived in the
course of any commercial activity.
75. The learned counsel also submitted that the assessee carries on
R&D work which enables educational institutions with information and
communication technology infrastructure for making education reach
the public at large solely for charitable purpose and further reliance was
placed upon ICAI Accounting Research Foundation V. DG of Income Tax
(Exemptions) Bureau of Indian Standards V. DG of Income Tax
(Exemption) and GS1 India V. DG of Income Tax (Exemption) 75
76. Mr Ajay Vohra, learned Senior Counsel, appearing for the Apparel
Export Promotion Council (AEPC) urged that it is a non-profit
organisation set up with approval of the Central Government, for
promotion of exports of garments from India (i.e. promotion of trade).
It was registered under Section 12-AA(1) of the IT Act, on 18-5-1979
and is engaged in the activity of promotion of the export of all kind of
ready-made garments, knitwear, and garments made of leather, jute
and hemp. It does not per se engage in any activity for profit, and its
mandate is to ensure that Indian apparel manufacturers, are given
forums and platforms, to showcase their products. For that purpose, the
AEPC charges subscriptions, and provides services, which have general
public utility. These activities are by way of booking large spaces in
fairs, and such like events, especially in overseas locales, so that Indian
manufacturers can interact with other overseas buyers, and are enabled
to promote trade. It was submitted that there is ex officio involvement
on behalf of the Central Government, in the AEPC's activities, including
in its policy formulation levels.
77. Mr Vohra relied upon the Memo Explaining Provisions in the
Finance Bill, 2008 76 , the speech of the Finance Minister in Lok Sabha on
Finance Bill, 20087, CBDT Circular No. 11 dated 19-12-2008 to
78
submit that proviso to Section 2(15) only bars commercial/business
activities undertaken for profit motive. It was submitted that mere
earning of income and/or charging any fees is not barred by the
proviso; rather, carrying of any activity in the nature of trade,
commerce or business or rendering service in relation thereto is barred.
Reliance was placed upon judgments in Director of Supplies & Disposals
V. Board of Revenue79 which follows H. Abdul Bakhi & Bros.66 66 , Barendra
Prasad Ray V. ITO80 and State of Gujarat V. Raipur Mfg. Co. Ltd. 41 to
argue that in "business" there must be some real and systematic, or
organised course of activity or conduct with the set purpose of making
profit.
78. The counsel referred to Sai Publication Fund60 where this Court
observed that since primary and dominant activity of the Trust was to
spread message of Saibaba and hence not business, then any incidental
or ancillary activity of publishing and selling of books and literature
cannot be regarded as business. Reference was made to Customs &
Excise Commissioners V. Lord Fisher81 which held that there are six
indicia to determining business, namely, (a) serious undertaking
earnestly pursued, (b) reasonable continuity,
(c) substantial in amount, (d) conducted regularly on business
principles, (e) predominantly concerned with making taxable supplies
for consideration, (f) such as those commonly made by persons seeking
to make profit. Other judgments too were cited; and reference was
made to definitions in the Concise Oxford Dictionary, Webster's New
Twentieth Century Dictionary, Black's Law Dictionary, and Sampath
Iyengar's Law of Income Tax.
79. Mr Ajay Vohra, urged that AEPC has been claiming exemption
under Section 11 from Assessment Years 1979-80 to 1990-91. During
Assessment Year 1991-92, the assessing officer ("AO") denied the
exemption on the ground that it was carrying on business. That order
was eventually set aside82 by the ITAT which, held that it was entitled
to exemption under Section 11 of the Act. Subsequently, an
amendment was brought to Section 11(4-A) and AEPC had to maintain
separate books of accounts. In Assessment Year 1992-93, the AO again
denied exemption. On appeal, the issue was decided in favour of AEPC
by the ITAT. The Delhi High Court upheld the order88 of the ITAT in a
judgment. AEPC received entrance fee and membership fee which, it
claimed were exempt on the principle of mutuality. This issue too was
resolved in its favour from Assessment Year 1992-93 to Assessment
Year 1997-98 by the jurisdictional High Court. From Assessment Year
1998-99 to Assessment Year 2008-09, the AO accepted the assessee's
claim that income was exempt under Section 11 of the Act.
80. During Assessment Years 2009-10 and 2010-11, the AO denied
exemption under Section 11 on the ground that the newly inserted
proviso to Section 2(15) was attracted; and thus the assessee was
ineligible for exemption under Section 11. The AO held that the
assessee was rendering services in relation to trade, commerce,
business for consideration and the receipt of which exceeds Rs 10
lakhs. The CIT (A) allowed the assessee's appeal following the
decision of the High Court in its case, and there being no changes in
the facts and circumstances of the case. The ITAT upheld the findings
of the first appellate authority as it observed that the assessee did not
carry any activity with an object of profit, and thus the question of
attracting the proviso did not arise.
81. Ms Prabha Swami, learned counsel submitted that the A.P. State
Seed Certification Agency is a statutory society set up under Section
884 of the Seeds Act, 1966 which is represented by the representatives
of Seedsmen Association, seed farmers, farming community and
members representing Central Seed Certification Board. While
explaining the charitable characteristic of the society the counsel
pointed out that the society was duly registered
and its memorandum of association clearly inter alia stated that the
object for which it was established was to see that the cultivators adopt
all scientific methods for production of quality seeds in accordance with
the Seeds Act and to carry on educational programs designed to
promote the use of certified seeds. Charges are collected from the
traders or the societies engaged in the trade of seeds. The society
provides quality seeds to the farmers and hence traders are prevented
from selling inferior variety of seeds. Highlighting the activities of the
authority, it was urged that farmers are benefited by various services it
offers - inspection of fields at the time of seed production, supervision
while processing seeds and issuing a validation certificate at the time of
packing, sampling, and seed testing. The society (which is not involved
in trade, commerce or business) is therefore rendering service to the
general public as they are encouraging farmers to purchase quality
seeds and help prevent loss to them, and loss of natural resources.
82. Mr Sanjay Jhawar, learned counsel for Rajasthan State Seed
Corporation also adopted the submissions of Ms Prabha Swami.
83. Mr Sanjay Visen, learned counsel argued on behalf of M/s
Raebareli Development Authority, Raebareli, urging that the assessee is
a body constituted under the U.P. Urban Planning and Development
Act, 1973. As their activities were aimed at public purpose, it applied
for registration under Section 12-AA of the IT Act, 1961. It was
submitted that the assessee's income was earlier exempted under
Section 10(20-A) of the IT Act, 1961 which was omitted by the Finance
Act, 2002; however, this did not restrict the assessee from getting
registered under Section 12-AA of IT Act, as the object of the Authority
is to provide shelter to homeless people, which is charitable.
84. Mr Harish Salve, learned Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of
Saurashtra Cricket Association drew attention of this Court towards the
ambit of Section 4(3) of the Income Tax Act, 1922 (i.e. the old Act), as
compared to Section 2(15) of the IT Act, 1961 which defines
"charitable purpose". He also presented the construction of Section 11
in light of Thanthi Trust It was emphasised that the objects of a trust
are decisive and every surplus cannot be construed as profit, as is
discussed in Krishna Warriar10. Profits from trade or business arising
out of property held under trust for charitable purpose, if ploughed back
to the extent of 100% cannot be termed as a commercial activity. This
was the principal idea in omitting Section (1) (bb) as it was
considered as restrictive for carrying out such activities. It was argued
that, substitution of the definition of "charitable purpose" in Section 2
(15) by the Finance Act, 2008 has not changed the law. The words "in
relation to any trade, commerce or business" and "for a cess, fee or
consideration" in the proviso to Section 2(15) implies that
advancement of object of a trust may not involve activities of profit. It
was urged that the amendment appears to have undermined this
Court's decision in Surat Art Silk1.
85. It was argued that the crucial part of the definition of "charitable
purpose" is the word "cess" employed in the proviso. As an explanatory
measure, the activities of promotional councils were taken into
consideration - for example Surat Art Silk1 supported silk
manufacturers. If such activity is for a cess or a fee, the organisation
ceases to be charitable. Activities in the nature of trade, commerce or
business are not charitable if they are for a fee or other consideration.
Fees collected by the private organisations forms the content of Section
2(15). However, amounts based on tariff regulations imposed by the
controlling law, or statute-based fee is neither "fee" nor "cess" under
that provision. Further, the consideration involved is vis-Ã -vis the
activity or service. The test is the object for which the consideration is
paid, and what it entails, wherein the words "any other consideration"
is for the activities in aid or service of business. In this regard it was
submitted that, in true sense the word "business" implies profit,
however statutory organisations are excluded from its ambit. Fee or
consideration collected by such organisations should not be taken in the
sense of profiteering, as it is for the advancement of their objectives. In
this sense the word "cess" can be read down as non-statutory.
86. It was submitted that the phrase "cess, fee or any other
consideration" in the proviso to Section 2(15) covers the second part of
the proviso i.e. it is relatable to "service in relation to" trade, commerce
or business. Mr Salve submitted that any statutory cess, or fee,
authorised or compelled by law, which is within the domain of the State
Legislature, cannot be construed as taxable, having regard to the
principles indicated in the judgment of this Court, in NDMC28. He relied
on Article 289 of the Constitution of India, and submitted that it is only
if a State engages - by itself, or through an agency, directly in trading
activity, that the immunity from Union taxation is lifted. In the present
case, those agencies set up by the State, essentially through law, to
carry out welfare activities, such as regulation and housing, cannot per
se be characterised as trading concerns.
87. Mr Salve submitted that Cricket Associations are operating
purely to advance their objective of promoting the sport. They should
not be considered as pursing activities in furtherance of trade,
commerce or business. The word "cess" has to be read down in reverse
(reverse ejusdem generis) and it should be read non-statutorily while
adopting purposive interpretation of the same. Reliance was placed on
Nabha Power Ltd. V. Punjab SPCL85 to state that a purposive
interpretation of "cess", is to be adopted.
88. It was also argued that the sport of cricket is a form of education
and if it is not considered as a field of education, it is still an object of
general public utility. The primary regulating body i.e. the BCCI,
promotes sport in the entire country and worldwide, and the assessees
herein are its second and third tier associations. The revenue generated
by BCCI flows to State and regional cricket associations in the form of
grants to maintain stadia, conduct matches,
organise training camps, and other ancillary purposes. The counsel
relied on the objects of Saurashtra Cricket Association which inter alia
include, the control, supervision, regulation, encouragement, promotion
and development of the game of cricket in the Association's
jurisdiction. Other objects include creation, fostering friendly
relationships through sports tournaments and the creation of a healthy
sportsmanship spirit, through the medium of sports in general and
cricket in particular. All other objects were similar, including "to
arrange, and/or manage among other things league and/or any other
tournaments"; organise matches, lay out grounds for playing cricket,
organisation of matches in aid of public charities, etc. If these
associations sell tickets and generate revenue through other activities,
those do not necessarily mean that their objects are commercial or to
promote trade. Selling tickets for a sport performance or match is to
promote cricket, and not trade.
89. Mr Salve also urged that the expression "trade" has a particular
meaning; he referred to State of Gujarat V. Maheshkumar Dhirajlal
"4.
The word "trade" in its narrow popular sense means
'exchange of goods for goods or for money with the object of making
profits'. In its widest sense it includes any business carried on with a
view to earn profit86 Further, the word takes its meaning from the
context."
90. Likewise, with regard to "business" the counsel referred to H.
Abdul Bakhi & Bros. 66 which had discussed the term and explained that
any activity should be driven by profit motive. 87 Lastly, the judgment in
Ministry of Information & Broadcasting, Union of India V. Cricket Assn.
of Bengal88 was cited to explain the dominant purpose of the BCCI.
That judgment highlighted what is relevant and applicable is the test of
predominant character of the activity, and not that an institution
incidentally earns surplus or profit.
91. Mr Arvind Datar, learned Senior Counsel appeared on behalf of
the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (hereafter "ICAI") as
well as The Tribune Trust.
92. The counsel submitted that ICAI is a premier professional
accountancy body of the country established under the Chartered
Accountants Act, 1949 ("the CA Act") to impart formal and quality
education in accounting and thereafter to regulate the profession of
Chartered Accountancy in India. It is under the control and supervision
of the Ministry of Corporate Affairs, Government of India. Section 1589
of the CA Act defines the functions of the Council of Institute which
include holding of examinations for chartered
accountancy course candidates and regulation of engagement and
training of articled clerks and audit assistants.
93. It was submitted that holding of coaching and revision classes,
and surplus generated due to the fees collected from that activity is not
a business or commercial activity. The counsel urged that it is wholly
incidental and ancillary to the objects of the institute - which is to
provide education and conduct examinations of the candidates enrolled
for chartered accountancy courses, so as to bring out true
professionalism. Therefore, separate books of accounts are not required
to be maintained in terms of Section 11(4-A) read with the fifth and
seventh provisos to Section 10(23-C) of the IT Act, 1961. It was urged
that ICAI was not hit by the proviso to Section 2(15) of the IT Act
(inserted w.e.f. 1-4-2009) since its activities fall within the purview of
the clause "education" specified in the definition of the expression
"charitable purpose" in Section 2(15) of the said Act, and not the
residuary clause relating to the GPU category, wherein the proviso
solely applies to the latter. In this regard the counsel referred to the
Gujarat High Court judgment in Saurashtra Education Foundation V.
CIT90 which took into account the observations made in another
judgment by the same High Court in Gujarat State Coop. Union V.
CIT91 to hold that the ICAI was existing solely for educational purposes
and its activities clearly fall within the category of "education" in
Section 2(15) of the Act. In further support of this proposition, reliance
was placed on American Hotel & Lodging Assn. Educational Institute V.
CBDT92 to argue that ICAI is entitled to be notified under Section 10(23
-C)(iv) read with Section 2(15) of the Act, 1961.
94. The counsel submitted that profit motive is an essential element,
or the driving force, for any business or commercial activity. The
activities of ICAI are not of such nature. The counsel relied upon the
judgment in NDMC28 which ruled that profit motive is the core aspect of
trade and business, in the context of Article 289 of the Constitution of
India, which talks about exemption of property and income of a State
from Union taxation.
95. It was argued that there is a distinction between nature of
commercial ventures and charitable institutions such as ICAI. The word
"profit" should never be used with a body set up for public purposes, to
regulate activities, in public interest and the intent of the
organisation/establishment must be taken into consideration. In
support, Port of Madras was cited, where the Port Trust's activities
included sale of unclaimed and unserviceable goods in discharge of
various statutory charges, items, etc. They were part of the Port Trust's
main activities of service. The Court said that they cannot be treated as
"business" and that the Port Trust had no intention to carry on business
in the sale of unserviceable/unclaimed goods. Reliance was placed
on Surat Art Silk1, A.P. SRTC19 Victoria Technical Institute V. CIT93
Aditanar Educational Institution V. CIT94, Thiagarajar Charities V. CIT95,
Director of Income Tax V. Bharat Diamond Bourse96 and Gujarat
Maritime Board case58 The observations in T.M.A. Pai49 that there can
be reasonable revenue surplus, by the educational institution for the
purpose of development of education and expansion of the institution,
was also referred to.
96. The learned Senior Counsel further relied on the Explanatory
Notes to the provisions of the Finance Act, 2008, specifically towards
amendment made to Section 2(15) of the IT Act, aimed at streamlining
the definition of "charitable purpose" as discussed in Para 597 and the
ratio of Visvesvaraya Technological University V. CIT98 to submit that
there is no loss to the character of a GPU charity where surplus
generated is ploughed back. Further, a judgment of the Division Bench
of the Delhi High Court in J.K. Synthetics Ltd. V. Union of India99 was
referred to contend that it is not open for the Revenue Authorities,
without any cogent reason and merely at its own caprices, to refuse to
follow
the conclusion reached on the earlier occasion, and to take up a totally
different stand in subsequent years - as was done in this case while
refusing to grant exemption under Section 10(23-C) of the IT Act, 1961
to the ICAI.
97. The learned counsel further submitted that the present case
involves two circulars issued by the Board viz. Circular No. 1/2009
dated 27-3-2009 and Circular No. 11/2008 dated 19-12-2008 which
are clarificatory and not contrary to any provisions of the 1961 Act and
hence the ratio of the decision in Ratan Melting & Wire Industries42
does not apply. Reliance was placed on observations made in Navnit Lal
Javeri37 and Ellerman Lines Ltd. V. CIT100 to urge that these circulars
are classified as "beneficial". They place a purposive interpretation on a
statutory provision. Such circulars enormously reduce litigation and
hardship of the assessees and they play a vital role in the proper
administration of taxes.
98. It was argued that the demand against ICAI is from 2004-05
and the fees collected from the students have already been spent on
various infrastructure development and other capital expenditure items.
The surplus amounts remaining were invested in government
securities/FDs of nationalised banks, so the demands raised will
seriously prejudice the assessees.
99. On behalf of The Tribune Trust, Mr Datar argued that the
charitable nature of the Trust can be traced back to Trustees of Tribune,
In re5 judgment rendered by the Privy Council, which allowed the
Trust's appeal against the judgment101 of the Lahore High Court (that
rejected exemption for the Trust's income for Assessment Year 1932-
33). The Privy Council considered the objects of the Trust and held it
was not founded for private profit and prima facie the Trust's object
was of general public utility, since by supplying newspapers in the
province the Trust involved the dissemination of educated public
opinion. It was urged that the impugned judgment passed by the
Punjab and Haryana High Court102 in Tribune's case dismissing the
Tribune's appeal, erroneously relied on para 17 of Surat Art Silk1
decision which wrongly quoted the Privy Council judgment in the
Tribune's case.
100. It was further argued that collecting advertisements for
consideration cannot be treated as business activity undertaken for
profit because the sale price of the newspaper is Rs 2 whereas the cost
of printing each newspaper is Rs 12 and the deficits can be made up
only through advertisements. Placing reliance on the extracts from the
will of the late Sardar Dyal Singh Majithia it was urged that the trustees
were under a duty to devote the surplus income for the improvement of
the newspaper and hence prayed for allowing the appeal.
101. Upon this Court's query with respect to advancing submissions
on the constitutional aspect in ITPO judgment103, the learned Senior
Counsel advanced his submissions on the validity of Section 2(15) in
the context of Article 14 and Article 289. It was submitted that
classification made in ITPO judgment10 i.e. institutions driven by profit
motive vis-Ã -vis institutions driven by motive to advance objective of
GPU, was correct and is in tune with the decision of this Court in
NDMC28 28 It was urged that Article 289(1) will not apply to ITPO as its
income and property cannot be regarded as income and property of a
State. It was also submitted that the proviso to Section 2(15) applies
only to the last limb i.e. "advancement of object of general public
utility" and not to the preceding limb "education" and in respect of
charity there is no discernible difference between the two. Since there
is no intelligible differentia and rational nexus in this regard, this
discrimination offends Article 14.
102. It was argued that the term "for a cess or fee or any other
consideration" used in Section 2(15) is clearly violative of Article 14 as
it fails to make a distinction between activities that are carried out by
the State or by the instrumentalities or agencies of the State, and those
carried out by commercial entities for which a consideration is charged.
In addition, Article 289(1) exempts States' property and income from
Union taxation. To permit levy of income tax on cess or fee collected by
a State would violate Article 289(1), hence the word "cess" or "fee" in
the proviso is liable to be declared unconstitutional and violative not
only of Article 14 but of Article 289 as well, in the context of the State
undertakings. For Central institutions, it was submitted that cess or fee
can never fall within the definition of "income" under Section 2(24)
read with Entry 82 of List I and cannot be subject to tax.
C. Revenue's rebuttal arguments
103. In rebuttal to the submissions advanced by the assessees, the
ASG relied upon Adityapur Industrial Area Development Authority V.
Union of IndiaÂ¹04 and submitted that there is no constitutional
immunity from taxation, for the State, because by Article 289(2) even
State or its instrumentalities/agencies are not immune from taxation if
they carry on trade or business. In light of Article 289(2), there is no
constitutional bar for the States (or the Union) to engage or carry on
trade or business, and Article 289 allows Parliament to impose taxes on
such trade or business. The ratio in NDMC28 has to be read in light of
the provisions and the judgment rendered in Shri Ramtanu Coop.
Housing Society33 should in turn be read in light of NDMC28. The
decisive factor therefore is not the status of the entity, but the nature
of activity carried by it. If the nature of activity is trade or business
with a profit motive, then the same can be taxed even if it is carried by
State or its instrumentalities. It was also contended that Article 289
does not grant any absolute immunity from taxation.
104. The Revenue further submitted that the validity of the
amendment can be tested especially in the case of exclusions or
exemptions on limited grounds - invalidity, arbitrariness,
unreasonableness, discrimination; and the assessees have not made
out a case under any such ground. Also, by referring to Trustees of
Tribune, In re5 and All India Spinners Assn. of Mirzapur 12, , it was
contended that "general public utility" is only a statutory creation so as
to form part of charitable purposes and it can always be given a
statutory import by subjecting it to conditions and limitations
prescribed under Section 2(15), at different points of time. In other
words, it can always be regulated or modulated through statutory
prescriptions, conditions, and limitations while granting an exemption
from taxation. The submission of the assessees, that one has to look
only at the objects to determine if it constitutes charitable purpose for
Section 2(15) of the Act, is to be rejected because exemptions or
exclusions are not based on mere objects of trust but on whether the
purpose of the trust is "advancement of any other object of general
public utility".
III. Analysis and reasoning
105. The history of the statute and the evolving interpretation of
"charitable purpose" reveal that in - Krishna Warriar1 10 , this Court
extensively considered the previous jurisprudence on the subject [in
light of the pre-existing Section 4(3) of the old law], as well as the
amendment introduced in 1953. At that time, income of a charitable
organisation, earned from business was subject to limitations. The
limitations were that : (i) the business was to be carried on in the
course of the actual carrying out of a primary purpose of the trust or
institution; or (ii) the work in connection with the business was to be
mainly carried on by beneficiaries of the institution. These expressions
were considered in Krishna Warriar10, where the Court held that the
term "property" (of a trust) was of widest amplitude, which included
business. The following decision, in Andhra Chamber of CommerceÂ¹Â¹
where the Chamber of Commerce had among its objects, one enabling
it to advocate policies or legislation, or oppose them, in addition to the
object of promoting business, held that the incidental inclusion of such
objects, involving espousing a political purpose, did not undermine its
essential or main purpose, of advancing objects of general public utility.
The new provision i.e. Section 2(15) of the IT Act, defined "charitable
purpose" restrictively : to deny tax exemption to activities for profit
which were carried on by a trust for the advancement of an object of
general public utility. The reason for this change (discussed previously)
was that the advantage of tax exemption was not intended to charitable
trusts that were commercial concerns, which while ostensibly serving a
public purpose, were fully paid for the benefits provided by them.
106. The first two decisions of some note are Lok Shikshana Trust14
and Indian Chamber of Commerce15. The former decision, by majority,
held that to qualify as a charitable purpose, two ingredients had to be
satisfied. It was held that the change in the definition meant that to be
the fourth category of charitable purpose, it was necessary to show
"7.
(1) the purpose of the trust is the advancement of any other
object of general public utility, and (2) the above purpose does not
involve the carrying on of any activity for profit. Both the above
conditions must be fulfilled before the purpose of the trust can be
held to be charitable purpose."
107. In Indian Chamber of Commerce15 this Court categorically held
that even if the activity for profit, is to further an object of general
public utility, the charity could not claim of exemption. The Court went
on to indicate the following test : (Indian Chamber of Commerce
15
"21. The true test is to ask for answers to the following
questions : (a) Is the object of the assessee one of general public
utility? (b) Does the advancement of the object involve activities
bringing in moneys? (c) If so, are such activities undertaken (i) for
profit or (ii) without profit? Even if (a) and (b) are answered
affirmatively, if (c) (i) is answered affirmatively, the claim for
exemption collapses. The solution to the problem of an activity being
one for or irrespective of profit is gathered on a footing of facts. What
is the real nature of the activity? One which is ordinarily carried on
by ordinary people for gain? Is there a built-in prescription in the
constitution against making a profit?"
(emphasis in original)
108. The decision in Surat Art Silk1, needs careful scrutiny, not only
because it is by a larger Bench, but also because it has been the
bulwark of the assessee's contentions-and has been the premise upon
which almost all High Courts have interpreted Section 2(15) after its
amendment, in 2008. As noticed earlier, the old Act [in Section 4(3)]
did not contain any terms, restricting or prohibiting charities from
engaging in commercial activities or those which yielded profit. No
doubt, the idea of income from business carried on "behalf of a religious
or charitable institution" being exempt, provided "the business is
carried on in the course of the actual carrying out of a primary purpose
of the institution" was introduced by amendment, in 1953. This was
interpreted in Andhra Chamber of CommerceÂ¹Â¹ and Krishna Warriar10.
However, Parliament clearly intended a departure, when it introduced
the new Section 2(15) under the IT Act. The earlier decisions in Indian
Chamber of CommerceÂ¹5, and Lok Shikshana Trust14 noticed this
change. Surat Art1 was yet another a departure. While it considered the
previous decisions of the Court, it
consciously departed from them, and even overruled the interpretation
in Indian Chamber of Commerce15. The larger Bench in Surat Art Silk1
agreed with the previous decisions to the effect that the motivation for
the activity in question (i.e. for it to be charitable) should not be
deriving of profits. However, the larger Bench enunciated the principle
of "predominant object" and held that what was of importance was
"whether the predominant object of the activity involved in carrying out
the object of general public utility is to subserve the charitable purpose
or to earn profit" and that such an entity would not lose its charitable
character merely because some profit arose from the said activity.
109. Thus, was born the "predominant object" test, of an
organisation, to determine whether it was essentially charitable, or "for
profit". If the predominant object was not for profit, but advancement
of general public utility, that some profits were earned, would not debar
it from claiming to be an organisation with a charitable purpose.
However, if the predominant object was such that profit making was
"enwrapped" or "intertwined" with it, the organisation or trust could not
be called charitable. Crucially, the Court emphasised that the manner of
carrying on of the activity in question, was determinative : (Surat Art
"19.
the nature of the charitable purpose, the manner in which
the activity for advancing the charitable purpose is being carried on
and the surrounding circumstances may clearly indicate that the
activity is not propelled by a dominant profit motive."
110. Interestingly, the test proposed by the majority judgment in
Surat Art Silk1 is similar to the one advocated in Indian Chamber of
Commerce15 (which it overruled). The difference in approach is that
Surat Art Silk1 advocated the "predominant object" test to see whether
the object is for advancement of general public utility, bereft of profit
motive, whereas in Indian Chamber of CommerceÂ¹5, the Court did not
deal with or visualise consideration of a "predominant object". The
second difference between the two decisions, is that Surat Art Silk1
stated that there is no need for an express provision in the constitution
of a given trust, eschewing profit motive, whereas in Indian Chamber of
CommerceÂ¹5, the necessity of such a condition was highlighted.
111. The judgments of this Court, after Surat Art Silk1, noticed the
enunciation of, and the need to apply the test of "dominant" object. In
"10.
In other words, the majority view in Surat Art Silk case1
was that the condition that the purpose should not involve the
carrying on of any activity for profit would be satisfied if profit-
making is not the real object. The theory of dominant or primary
object of the trust has, therefore, been treated to be the determining
factor, even in regard to the fourth
head of charity viz. the advancement of any other object of general
public utility, so as to make the carrying on of business activity merely
ancillary or incidental to the main object."
112. In Bar Council of MaharashtraÂ³2 this Court considered whether
a Bar Council, constituted under the Advocates Act, 1961, performed
activities that were charitable in nature; it was held that the statute
obliged several activities whose dominant object was advancement of
public utility, without profit motive. This Court held that the provisions
"10.
enjoined upon avowedly with the objective of protecting
the litigating public from unscrupulous professionals by taking them
to task for any misconduct on their part; it is also one of the
obligatory functions of a State Bar Council to promote and support
measures for law reform as also to conduct law seminars and
organise talks on legal topics by eminent jurists, obviously with a
view to educate the general public, the function prescribed by clause
(eee) is obviously charitable in nature, the same being to organise
legal aid to the poor. Amongst these various obligatory functions one
under clause (d) is to safeguard the rights, privileges and interests
of the advocates on its roll and it is difficult to regard it as a primary
or dominant function or purpose for which the body is constituted.
Even this function apart from securing speedy discharge of
obligations by the litigants to the lawyers ensures maintenance of
high professional standards and independence of the Bar which are
necessary in the performance of their duties to the society. In other
words, the dominant purpose of a State Bar Council as reflected by
the various obligatory functions is to ensure quality service of
competent lawyers to the litigating public, to spread legal literacy,
promote law reforms and provide legal assistance to the poor while
the benefit accruing to the lawyer-members is incidental."
113. The view that prevailed, after the decision in Surat Art Silk1,
therefore, was that so long as the "dominant" object of a trust was
charitable, and it did not essentially involve in business or commercial
activity, the generation of profits, or surpluses by it, through activities,
incidental to that main or dominant activity, did not undermine its
charitable purpose, as long as the surpluses or profits, were used for
the advancement of an object of general public utility.
114. An interesting detail, is that the old Act did not define
"charitable purpose" restrictively, in the manner that the IT Act did,
when enacted, in 1961. This lent a fair degree of interpretive flexibility,
to the courts, to decide whether a commercial or business element,
could be interwoven with a charitable object. The amendment of 1953
ensured that income " applied or accumulated for application to such
charitable purposes as relate to anything done within the taxable
territories, and in the case of property so held in part only for such
"106
purposes, the income applied or finally set apart for application
could
not be included as taxable income of any charitable organisation. This
provision is a precursor for Section 11 under the IT Act. In other words,
the structure of the old Act did not prohibit the carrying on of business;
it spelt out a condition that any income derived from business "carried
on in the course of the actual carrying out of a primary purpose of the
institution" if applied for charitable purposes, was exempt.
115. The second aspect is that Surat Art Silk1, was rendered in the
context of Section 2(15) of the IT Act, as it stood originally. However,
by the Taxation Laws Amendment Act, 1975 (w.e.f. 1-4-1977), Section
13(1)(bb) was inserted. That provision excluded the operation of
Sections 11 and 12 (under which income of charities was entitled to be
exempted) in the case of income derived from business by charities
engaged in medical relief, education and relief to the poor, unless the
business fulfilled a condition:
"13. (1)(bb) in the cases of a charitable trust or institution for
the relief of the poor, education or medical relief, which carries on
any business, any income derived from such business, unless the
business is carried on in the course of the actual carrying out of a
primary purpose of the trust or institution;"
116. The interpretation in Surat Art Silk1, obviously could not have
been affected, in the light of a subsequent amendment; however, what
is of significance is that with effect from 1-4-1977, the condition of
actual carrying on a primary purpose of the trust while conducting
business was visualised only in the case of trusts involved in relief of
the poor, education or medical relief. The majority judgment in Surat
"12.
Where therefore, there is a charitable trust or institution
falling within any of the first three categories of charitable purpose
set out in Section 2 clause (15) and it carries on business which is
held by it under trust for its charitable purpose, income from such
business would not be exempt by reason of Section 13(1)(bb).
Section 11 sub-section (4) would, therefore, have no application in
case of a charitable trust or institution falling within any of the first
three heads of "charitable purpose"."
107
Yet, the Court enunciated and applied the "predominant object" test.
The conscious omission of the last object i.e. the GPU category, in the
newly inserted Section 13(1)(bb), therefore, meant that when those
trusts, while carrying out the object of advancement of general public
utility, had to conduct of business, the income was to be taxed
[because the main provision, under Section 13(1) excluded the
operation of Sections 11 and 12].
117. The next significant change, which occurred was with the
Finance Act, 1983 (w.e.f. 1-4-1984). This amendment:
(a) omitted the restrictive words under Section 2(15) i.e. "not
involving the carrying on of any activity for profit",
(b) omitted Section 13(1)(bb),
(c) Section 11 (4-A) was inserted108 , by which - in relation to
charities set up with the object of general public utilities, "business"
could be "carried on by an institution wholly for charitable purposes
and the work in connection with the business is mainly carried on by
the beneficiaries of the institution, and separate books of account are
maintained by the trust or institution in respect of such business".
118. It is therefore clear that after 1-4-1984, the statute did not
contain any restriction as to the nature of activity that could be carried
on by GPU category charity. Furthermore, the condition in Section 13(1)
(bb) - which applied to other kinds of trusts i.e. that their incomes
could be exempt under Section 11 to the extent they arose out of
business, if the business was "in the course of the actual carrying out of
a primary purpose of the trust" - was deleted. On the other hand, the
wording of Section 11(4-A) did seem to indicate that business activity
was permissible if the objects of the trust were wholly charitable, and
such business were to be carried on by its beneficiaries. This legal
position continued, till the amendments in question were carried out, in
relation to Section 2(15) in 2008.
119. Section 2 begins with the expression "unless the context
otherwise requires" - as a preface to every expression which is sought
to be defined, under the IT Act. The 1922 Act did not contain any words
of restriction, in the definition clause. The IT Act, however, defined
charitable purpose - at the outset, restrictively, and then,
substantively enacted provisions that give effect to parliamentary
intent. Section 10(23-C) (iv) exempts any "income" of "any other fund
or institution established for charitable purposes which may be
approved by the prescribed authority, having regard to the objects of
the fund or institution and its importance throughout India or
throughout any State or States" from taxation.
A. Aids to interpretation
(i) History of the legislation
120. The amendments (i.e. Finance Act, 2008, Finance Act, 2009,
Finance Act, 2012 and Finance Act, 2015) do not throw light - by way
of Statement of Objects and Reasons or notes on clauses. The Court,
therefore would have to resort to the surrounding circumstances that
led to the amendment.
121. The words of a statute are to be construed in their terms,
according to the circumstances in which they occur. At the same time,
there is some authority for the proposition that statutes - particularly
amending provisions, may be considered in the light of the previous
history of the legislation. Cardozo, J. in Duparquet Huot Moneuse Co. V.
Evans10 said that in questions relating to construction, "history is a
109
teacher that is not to be ignored". In a similar vein, Learned Hand, C.J.
said that "statutes always have some purpose or object to accomplish,
whose sympathetic and imaginative discovery is the surest guide to
their meaning"110.
122. Some decisions of this Court have highlighted this aspect. In
Bhuwalka Steel Industries Ltd. V. Bombay Iron & Steel Labour Board 111
"35.
`21.
The legislative intent of the enactment may be
gathered from several sources which are, from the statute itself,
from the Preamble to the statute, from the Statement of Objects and
Reasons, from the legislative debates, reports of committees and
commissions which preceded the legislation and finally from all
legitimate and admissible sources from where they may be allowed.
Reference may be had to legislative history and latest legislation
also. But, the primary rule of construction would be to ascertain the
plain language used in the enactment which advances the purpose
and object of the legislation. ,111a",
(emphasis in original)
123. In Chief Justice of A.P. V. L.V.A. Dixitulu1 112 again, the Court
held that resort to the history of the legislation is legitimate, for
"66.
in order to ascertain the true meaning of the terms and
phrases employed, it is legitimate for the Court to go beyond the
arid literal confines of the provision and to call in aid other well-
recognised rules of construction, such as its legislative history, the
basic scheme and framework of the statute as a whole, each portion
throwing light on the rest, the purpose of the legislation, the object
sought to be achieved, and the consequences that may flow from the
adoption of one in preference to the other possible interpretation."
124. Other decisions have also commented on the use of history
113
of the legislation as a tool for its construction. It is, therefore, clear that
courts can look at the previous history of the statute, and the changes
it underwent to discern what is intended by the lawmakers when an
amendment is introduced, or a new law enacted. In light of these
factors, it would therefore, also be useful for the Court to consider the
background which led to the amendment - firstly in 2008 and
thereafter in 2012 and 2015, seeking to restrict the nature of activities
that a GPU category charity can legitimately undertake.
(ii) Other extrinsic aids to construction of the statute
(a) Speeches in Parliament
125. Speeches made in the legislature or Parliament, can be looked
into for throwing light on the rationale for an amendment. There is
some authority for that proposition. 114 Some light can be discerned
from the statement of the Finance Minister on the floor of Parliament,
who answered to the criticism levelled against the change brought
about by the amendment in 2008. The Finance Minister commented on
the criticism levelled against the amendment to Section 2(15) in the
following words:
"I once again assure the House that genuine charitable
organisations will not in any way be affected. The CBDT will,
following the usual practice, issue an explanatory circular containing
guidelines for determining whether an entity is carrying on any
activity in the nature of trade, commerce or business or any activity
of rendering any service
in relation to any trade, commerce or business. Whether the purpose is
a charitable purpose will depend on the totality of the facts of the case.
Ordinarily, Chambers of Commerce and similar organisations rendering
services to their members would not be affected by the amendment
and their activities would continue to be regarded as "advancement of
any other object of general public utility"."
(b) Departmental circulars
126. The learned counsel for the assessees relied upon Circular No.
1/2009 dated 27-3-2009 and Circular No. 11/2008 dated 19-12-2008
issued by the Central Board of Direct Taxes. The relevant part of
Circular No. 11/2008 reads as follows:
"3. The newly inserted proviso to Section 2(15) will apply only to
entities whose purpose is "advancement of any other object of
general public utility" i.e. the fourth limb of the definition of
"charitable purpose" contained in Section 2(15). Hence, such entities
will not be eligible for exemption under Section 11 or under Section
10(23-C) of the Act if they carry on commercial activities. Whether
such an entity is carrying on an activity in the nature of trade,
commerce or business is a question of fact which will be decided
based on the nature, scope, extent and frequency of the activity.
3.1. There are industry and trade associations who claim
exemption from tax under Section 11 on the ground that their
objects are for charitable purpose as these are covered under "any
other object of general public utility". Under the principle of
mutuality, if trading takes place between persons who are associated
together and contribute to a common fund for the financing of some
venture or object and in this respect have no dealings or relations
with any outside body, then any surplus returned to the persons
forming such association is not chargeable to tax. In such cases,
there must be complete identity between the contributors and the
participants.
Therefore, where industry or trade associations claim both to be
charitable institutions as well as mutual organisations and their
activities are restricted to contributions from and participation of
only their members, these would not fall under the purview of the
proviso to Section 2(15) owing to the principle of mutuality.
However, if such organisations have dealings with non-members,
their claim to be charitable organisations would now be governed by
the additional conditions stipulated in the proviso to Section 2(15)."
127. Circular No. 1/2009 dated 27-3-2009 contains Explanatory
Notes to provisions of the Finance Act, 2008. It inter alia reads as
follows:
"5. Streamlining the definition of "charitable purpose"
5.1. Sub-section (15) of Section 2 of the Act defines "charitable
purpose" to include relief of the poor, education, medical relief, and
the advancement of any other object of general public utility. It has
been noticed that a number of entities operating on commercial lines
are claiming exemption on their income either under sub-section (23
-C) of Section 10 or Section 11 of the Act on the ground that they
are charitable
institutions. This is based on the argument that they are engaged in
the "advancement of an object of general public utility" as is included
in the fourth limb of the current definition of "charitable purpose". Such
a claim, when made in respect of an activity carried out on commercial
lines, is contrary to the intention of the provision.
5.2. With a view to limiting the scope of the phrase "advancement
of any other object of general public utility", sub-section (15) of
Section 2 has been amended to provide that the advancement of any
other object of general public utility shall not be a charitable
purpose, if it involves the carrying on of any activity in the nature of
trade, commerce or business, or any activity of rendering any service
in relation to any trade, commerce or business, for a cess or fee or
any other consideration, irrespective of the nature of use or
application, or retention, of the income from such activity. Scope of
this amendment has further been explained by the CBDT vide its
Circular No. 11/2008 dated 19-12-2008."
128. The Senior Counsel appearing for the assessees relied on
Section 119 of the IT Act as well as decisions of this Court, reported as
Navnit Lal Javeri37 and UCO Bank38 and argued that departmental
circulars are binding upon tax administrators, and should be
legitimately considered as aids of construction. This was in support of
their reliance on the circulars in the present case (No. 11/2008 and No.
1/2009).
129. This Court in Navnit Lal Javeri3 considered Sections 2(6-A)(e)
and 12(1-B) of the IT Act which were introduced by Finance Act, 15 of
1955 (w.e.f. 1-4-1955). As a result of these amendments, the
combined effect of the two provisions was that three kinds of payments
made to shareholders companies to which those applied, were treated
as taxable dividend to the extent of the accumulated profits held by the
company. The provision was challenged. It was noticed that while
introducing the amendment, the Finance Minister assured that
outstanding loans and advances - otherwise liable to taxation as
dividends in Assessment Year 1955-1956, would not be subjected to
tax if it were shown that they had been genuinely refunded to the
respective companies before 30-6-1955. The Government felt that
unless such a step was taken, the operation of Section 12(1-B) would
lead to extreme hardship, as it would cover the aggregate of all
outstanding loans of past years and could have led to unreasonably
high liability on shareholders to whom the loans might have been
advanced. A circular [No. 20(XXI-6)/55] was issued by the Central
Board of Revenue on 10-5-1955.
130. The Court, in that context, observed that : (Navnit Lal Javeri
37
case
, AIR p. 1379, para 6)
"6.
It is clear that a circular of the kind which was issued by the
Board would be binding on all officers and persons employed in the
execution of the Act under Section 5(8) of the Act. This circular
pointed out to all the officers that it was likely that some of the
companies might have
advanced loans to their shareholders as a result of genuine transactions
of loans, and the idea was not to affect such transactions and not to
bring them within the mischief of the new provision.
The officers were, therefore, asked to intimate to all the
companies that if the loans were repaid before 30-6-1955, in a
genuine manner, they would not be taken into account in
determining the tax liability of the shareholders to whom they may
have been advanced. In other words, past transactions which would
normally have attracted the stringent provisions of Section 12(1-B)
as it was introduced in 1955, were substantially granted exemption
from the operation of the said provisions by making it clear to all the
companies and their shareholders that if the past loans were
genuinely refunded to the companies, they would not be taken into
account under Section 12(1-B). Section 12(1-B) would, therefore,
normally apply to loans granted by the companies, to their
respective shareholders with full notice of the provisions prescribed
by it."
This Court ultimately upheld the amendments. As is evident, the
judgment noticed that the circular sought to soften the rigours of the
otherwise harsh consequence of immediate application of the
amendment. There was nothing in the circular to make it applicable for
all times to come. It was more in the nature of the Government issuing
a temporary suspension of operation of the substantive provision,
introduced by the amendment.
131. In UCO Bank38, this Court had to deal with circulars issued
under Section 145 regarding the method of accounting to be followed,
in the context of bank loans to be written off, when an assessee was
following the mercantile system (of accounting). The Court inter alia,
held that under Section 119(2) of the IT Act, the Central Board of
Direct Taxes is empowered, for proper and efficient management of
assessment and collection of revenue to issue general or special orders
in respect of any class of incomes or class of cases setting forth
directions or instructions, not being prejudicial to assessees, as the
guidelines, principles or procedures to be followed in the work relating
"9.
The Board thus has power, inter alia, to tone down the
rigour of the law and ensure a fair enforcement of its provisions, by
issuing circulars in exercise of its statutory powers under Section
119 of the Income Tax Act which are binding on the authorities in
the administration of the Act. Under Section 119(2)(a), however, the
circulars as contemplated therein cannot be adverse to the assessee.
Thus, the authority which wields the power for its own advantage
under the Act is given the right to forego the advantage when
required to wield it in a manner it considers just by relaxing the
rigour of the law or in other permissible manners as laid down in
Section 119. The power is given for the purpose of just, proper and
efficient management of the work of assessment and in public
interest."
132. The view expressed in Navnit Lal Javeri37, and later elaborated
in UCO Bank38 appears to have found resonance in other decisions115 of
this Court. A recent instance where this Court took aid of explanatory
circulars is in CIT V. Vatika Township (P) Ltd.116 when after holding that
the amendment in question applied prospectively, the Court also
supported that holding by citing the Revenue's understanding about
such prospective application, in a circular. What is of note in that
judgment, is that the question of whether circulars or explanatory notes
issued by the executive are binding aids of construction was not
discussed; more importantly, the Court first interpreted the statute, in
its own terms, and then cited the circular.
133. That circulars are per se not binding upon courts, in regard to
interpretation of a statutory provision and, at best are guides or aid to
interpretation for departmental authorities, who are bound to take them
into account, was pithily stated in Keshavji Ravji & Co. V. CIT 117 where
"32. This contention and the proposition on which it rests,
namely, that all circulars issued by the Board have a binding legal
quality incurs, quite obviously, the criticism of being too broadly
stated. The Board cannot pre-empt a judicial interpretation of the
scope and ambit of a provision of the "Act" by issuing circulars on
the subject. This is too obvious a proposition to require any
argument for it. A circular cannot even impose on the taxpayer a
burden higher than what the Act itself on a true interpretation
envisages. The task of interpretation of the laws is the exclusive
domain of the courts. However, this is what Sri Ramachandran really
has in mind - circulars beneficial to the assessees and which tone
down the rigour of the law issued in exercise of the statutory power
under Section 119 of the Act or under corresponding provisions of
the predecessor Act are binding on the authorities in the
administration of the Act. The Tribunal, much less the High Court, is
an authority under the Act. The circulars do not bind them. But the
benefits of such circulars to the assessees have been held to be
permissible even though the circulars might have departed from the
strict tenor of the statutory provision and mitigated the rigour of the
law. But that is not the same thing as saying that such circulars
would either have a binding effect in the interpretation of the
provision itself or that the Tribunal and the High Court are supposed
to interpret the law in the light of the circular. There is, however,
support of certain judicial observations for the view that such
circulars constitute external aids to construction."
134. This view was accepted in Commr. of Customs V. Indian Oil
Corpn. Ltd. 118 , which articulated the position with some degree of
clarity. Commenting on Navnit Lal Javeri37 and other decisions, it was
"30. No proposition was laid down in that case that even if the
circular was clearly contrary to the provisions of the Act it should
prevail. On the other hand, the learned Judges were inclined to view
the circular as granting the benefit of exemption from the operation
of the impugned provisions subject to fulfilment of certain
conditions. Navnit Lal case37 was referred to and construed in two
cases decided by Benches of two learned Judges. The first one was
the case of Ellerman Lines Ltd. V. CIT100 and the other is K.P.
Varghese V. ITOÂ¹Â¹9. In both these cases it was assumed that Navnit
Lal case37 was an authority for the proposition that even if the
directions given in the circular clearly deviate from the provisions of
the Act, yet, the Revenue is bound by it. These three decisions were
repeatedly referred to and relied on in the subsequent decisions in
which the issue arose as regards the binding nature of the circulars
either under the Income Tax Act or under the Central Excise Act. In
between, there was the three-Judge Bench decision in Sirpur Paper
Mills Ltd. V. CWT120 in which Section 13 of the Wealth Tax Act
corresponding to Section 5(8) of the Income Tax Act, 1922 fell for
consideration. This Court took the view that the instructions issued
by the Board may control the exercise of the power of the
departmental officials in matters administrative but not quasi-
judicial. There is yet another decision of a three-Judge Bench which
seems to make a dent on the weight of the proposition that the
circulars of the Board, even if they are plainly contrary to the
provisions of the Act, should be given effect to and binding on the
authorities concerned in the administration of the Act. That is the
case of Keshavji Ravji & Co. V. CIT 117. " "
135. In view of a conflict between the decisions, on the binding
nature of circulars issued by the Board (in the context of decisions of
authorities dealing with indirect taxation issues) this Court, by a five-
Judge Bench decision, in Ratan Melting & Wire Industries42 held that
"7. Circulars and instructions issued by the Board are no doubt
binding in law on the authorities under the respective statutes, but
when the Supreme Court or the High Court declares the law on the
question arising for consideration, it would not be appropriate for the
court to direct that the
circular should be given effect to and not the view expressed in a
decision of this Court or the High Court. So far as the
clarifications/circulars issued by the Central Government and of the
State Government are concerned they represent merely their
understanding of the statutory provisions. They are not binding upon
the court. It is for the court to declare what the particular provision of
statute says and it is not for the executive. Looked at from another
angle, a circular which is contrary to the statutory provisions has really
no existence in law."
136. In the opinion of this Court, the views expressed in Keshavji
Ravji117, , Indian Oil Corpn. 118 and Ratan Melting & Wire Industries42
(though the last decision does not cite Navnit Lal Javeri37), reflect the
correct position i.e. that circulars are binding upon departmental
authorities, if they advance a proposition within the framework of the
statutory provision. However, if they are contrary to the plain words of a
statute, they are not binding. Furthermore, they cannot bind the courts,
which have to independently interpret the statute, in their own terms.
At best, in such a task, they may be considered as departmental
understanding on the subject and have limited persuasive value. At the
highest, they are binding on tax administrators and authorities, if they
accord with and are not at odds with the statute; at the worst, if they
cut down the plain meaning of a statute, or fly on the face of their
express terms, they are to be ignored.
B. Interpretation of Section 2(15), the definition clause
137. Section 2 of the Income Tax Act opens with the phrase "unless
the context otherwise requires". It has been held in S.K. Gupta V. K.P.
JainÂ¹21 that where the definition of a term is preceded by this phrase,
normally, the definition given in the section "should be applied and
given effect to but this normal rule can be deviated if there is
something in the context to show that the definition should not be
applied". This rule was also adopted in Indira Nehru Gandhi V. Raj
Narain122 by Khanna, J. and in Kalya Singh V. Genda Lal123 . Previously,
in Vanguard Fire & General Insurance Co. Ltd. V. Fraser and Ross124 , it
was held that the term "unless the context otherwise requires" implies
that the word or term so defined should be applied - subject to the
context. It was held that in view of such a qualification, the Court has
not only to look at the words but also to look at the context, collocation,
and the object of such words in respect of such matters and factor the
meaning to be conveyed by the use of the words under the
circumstances. Almost the same reasoning has been echoed in N.K.
Jain V. C.K. Shah 125
138. The importance of terms expressly defined in a statute is that
they are internal and binding aids to interpretation. The prefacing - to
any definition - of the phrase "unless the context otherwise requires"
merely signifies that in case there is anything expressly to the contrary,
in any specific provision(s) in the body of the Act, a different meaning
can be attributed. However, to discern the purport of a provision, the
term, as defined has to prevail, whenever the expression is used in the
statute. This rule is subject to the exception that when a contrary
intention is plain, in particular instances, that meaning is to be given.
Therefore, in the light of the previous discussion, this Court would
interpret the true meaning of "charitable purpose" after its amendment
in 2008, taking into consideration the subsequent changes.
139. As observed at the beginning of this judgment, GPU charities
have been recognised as distinct from the "per se categories" of charity
(education, medical relief, relief to the poor; and later - preservation of
watersheds, monuments, environment, and yoga). The judgment of
this Court in DharmadeeptiÂ²1 has clarified that the per se categories -
are not subjected to the restrictive condition of eschewing activities of
profit. This enunciation of the principle has been endorsed in all later
decisions - starting with Surat Art Silk1. Therefore, the restriction
imposed by Parliament against charities - prohibiting them from
carrying on activities of profit do not apply to the first six categories.
Although the occasion did not so arise in Surat Art Silk1 (since this
Court was dealing with Assessment Years prior to 1975), the provision
in Section 13(1)(bb) which prevailed then with effect from 1-4-1977
made the position clearer in that it permitted these per se category
charities, in the course of their actual carrying on of their activities, to
earn profits. Of course, this provision was deleted from 1-4-1984.
Alongside, the restriction imposed on GPUs from engaging in activities
for profit, was also deleted.
140. As noticed in Thanthi Trust Section 11(4-A) was originally
introduced with effect from 1-4-1984 and substituted w.e.f. 1-4-1991.
At that stage, the statute as it stood, did not restrict GPU category
charities from carrying on activities of profit or from carrying on
business. This Court nevertheless was bound by the decision in Surat
Art Silk1 which had ruled that:
(i) A GPU category charity with a constitution granting discretion
to the trustees to engage in charitable and non-charitable activities,
could not claim the exemption;
(ii) The main or dominant purpose of the GPU category charity
had to be essentially charitable. If it was so, and it incidentally
entailed carrying on activities that led to profit, it was entitled to
exemption.
141. This Court's understanding of the law as expressed in Thanthi
Trust was therefore, coloured by the statute as it existed, and the
formulation in Surat Art Silk1. As a result, Thanthi TrustÂ², interpreted
Section 11(4-A) in this background and held that the assessee in that
case incidentally was engaged in activities for profit. The Court was also
of the opinion that Section 11(4-A) was wider than the Revenue urged
it to be, in that activities by way of business could not be carried on
incidentally by a trust, which otherwise was a GPU category trust.
142. As noticed earlier, between Surat Art Silk1 and the decisions
rendered thereafter (i.e. Bar Council of MaharashtraÂ³Â², , FICCI105 and
Thanthi Trust there were two changes in law in 1983 w.e.f. 1-4-1984
- on the one hand deleting the restrictive words prohibiting GPU
categories from carrying on profit, and deleting Section 13(1)(bb), and
introducing Section 11(4-A), on the other. There was otherwise no
meaningful statutory change. The position therefore, continued as it
was for about 25 years.
143. After its introduction, by amendment in 2008, Section 2(15)
read as follows:
2. (15) "charitable purpose" includes relief of the poor,
education, medical relief, and the advancement of any other object
of general public utility:
Provided that the advancement of any other object of general
public utility shall not be a charitable purpose, if it involves the
carrying on of any activity in the nature of trade, commerce or
business, or any activity of rendering any service in relation to any
trade, commerce or business, for a cess or fee or any other
consideration, irrespective of the nature of use or application, or
retention, of the income from such activity;"
144. The term "in the nature of" occurring in Section 2(15) has
frequently been interpreted by this Court. In G. Venkataswami Naidu &
Co.
V.
CIT126 the isolated transaction of sale of land was held not to be
activity in the nature of trade or business. In State of T.N. V. Burmah
Shell Oil Storage & Distributing Co. of India Ltd. 127 the test indicated
was whether the "frequency, volume, continuity and regularity of
transactions carried on with a profit-motive". In State of T.N. V. Shakti
EstatesÂ¹28 , the assessee's activities in leasing forest lands, clearing
them, and creation of wooden sleepers, which were sold, as well as
charcoal, which was sold, in a series of "sustained, systematic and
organised activities" was held to be in the nature of business.
145. In Director of Supplies & Disposals V. Board of Revenue this
Court outlined, what would be activity in the nature of business : (AIR
p. 1830, para 14)
"14.
To regard an activity as business there must be a course of
dealings, either actually continued or contemplated to be continued
with a profit-motive; there must be some real and systematic or
organised course of activity or conduct with a set purpose of making
profit. To infer from a course of transactions that it is intended
thereby to carry on business ordinarily there must exist the
characteristics of volume, frequency, continuity and system
indicating an intention to continue the activity of carrying on the
transactions for a profit. But no single test or group of tests is
decisive of the intention to carry on the business."
146. The term "in relation to" was interpreted in Renusagar Power
Co. Ltd. V. General Electric Co. 129 in an arbitration clause - as follows :
"25.
(2) Expressions such as "arising out of" or "in respect of"
or "in connection with" or "in relation to" or "in consequence of" or
"concerning" or "relating to" the contract are of the widest amplitude
and content "
147. In Mansukhlal Dhanraj Jain V. Eknath Vithal Ogale 130 this Court
16)
"16. It is, therefore obvious that the phrase "relating to recovery
of possession" as found in Section 41(1) of the Small Cause Courts
Act is comprehensive in nature and takes in its sweep all types of
suits and proceedings which are concerned with the recovery of
possession of suit property from the licensee and, therefore, suits for
permanent injunction restraining the defendant from effecting
forcible recovery of such possession from the licensee-plaintiff would
squarely be covered by the wide sweep of the said phrase."
148. In Doypack Systems (P) Ltd. V. Union of India Â¹Â³1, this Court
ruled that the expression "in relation to" is broad and is akin to the
"concerning with" and "pertaining to"; and is also expansive. The Court
"50. The expression "in relation to" (so also "pertaining to"), is a
very broad expression which presupposes another subject-matter.
These are words of comprehensiveness which might have both direct
significance as well as indirect significance depending on the context
[internal citation omitted]. Assuming that the investments in shares
and in lands do not form part of the undertaking but are different
subject-matters, even then
these would be brought within the purview of the vesting by reason of
the above expressions. In this connection reference may be made to 76
Corpus Juris Secundum at pp. 620 and 621 where it is stated that the
term "relate" is also defined as meaning to bring into association or
connection with. It has been clearly mentioned that "relating to" has
been held to be equivalent to or synonymous with as to "concerning
with" and "pertaining to". The expression "pertaining to" is an
expression of expansion and not of contraction."
149. The position, therefore, with respect to what kind of activities
GPU charities could legitimately undertake, was in a state of flux till
2015. However, the amendments cumulatively point to prohibitions
that were constant:
149.1. The prohibition applicable to such charities involved in
carrying on activities "in the nature of trade, commerce or business, or
any activity of rendering any service in relation to any trade, commerce
or business, for a cess or fee or any other consideration".
149.2. "Irrespective of the nature of use or application, or retention,
of the income from such activity" (i.e. activity in the nature of trade,
commerce or business for a cess, fee or other consideration).
150. By retrospective amendment, in Section 2(15), after the
proviso, a second proviso was inserted with effect from 1-4-2009-
"Provided further that the first proviso shall not apply if the
aggregate value of the receipts from the activities referred to therein
is ten lakh rupees or less in the previous year;"
With the introduction of the second proviso, the resulting situation was
that the first proviso (of exclusion of income through an activity as
referred to) was inapplicable if the aggregate value of the receipts of
such activity did not exceed Rs 10,00,000, and later by the Finance
Act, 2012 - this was enhanced to Rs 25,00,000.
151. The next important change took place through the Finance Act,
2015, which, w.e.f. 1-4-2016 substituted the two provisos to Section 2
(15) with the following proviso:
"Provided that the advancement of any other object of general
public utility shall not be a charitable purpose, if it involves the
carrying on of any activity in the nature of trade, commerce or
business, or any activity of rendering any service in relation to any
trade, commerce or business, for a cess or fee or any other
consideration, irrespective of the nature of use or application, or
retention, of the income from such activity, unless-
(i) such activity is undertaken in the course of actual carrying
out of such advancement of any other object of general public
utility; and
(ii) the aggregate receipts from such activity or activities
during the previous year, do not exceed twenty per cent of the
total receipts, of the trust or institution undertaking such activity
or activities, of that previous year;"
152. The limited relief, given by the second proviso, to GPU charities
(for the period 2009-2015) was that in case such GPU category
charities did carry on activities undertaken in the course of actual
carrying out of their GPU objects that were in the nature of trade,
commerce or business, or rendered any service in relation to trade,
business, etc. and collected fee, cess, or other consideration, such
income could still be exempt, if it did not exceed Rs 10,00,000 (and
later, Rs 25,00,000). By the amendment of 2015, the second proviso
was deleted and two conditions were introduced, with respect to
permissibility of carrying on trade, commerce, etc:
152.1. Such activity is undertaken in the course of actual carrying
out of such advancement of any other object of general public utility.
152.2. The aggregate receipts from such activity or activities during
the previous year, do not exceed twenty per cent of the total receipts,
of the trust or institution undertaking such activity or activities, of that
previous year.
153. Having thus far discussed a nature of the changes to the term
"charitable purpose" and how judicial thinking has shaped it, this Court
would now explore the all-important question of the scope of the term
of "any other object generally public utility" not being charitable
purpose "if it involves the carrying on of any activity in the nature of
trade, commerce or business or any activity of rendering any service in
relation to any trade, commerce or business, for a cess or fee or any
other consideration, irrespective of the nature of use or application, or
retention, of the income from such activity."
154. Parliamentary endeavour, was to alter the regime applicable to
taxation of GPU category charities, under the IT Act. The absolute bar
imposed on GPU charities from carrying on activities in the nature of
trade, commerce or business, or of rendering any service in relation to
any trade, commerce or business, for a cess or fee or any other
consideration, evidences this intent. The original Section 2(15) did not
allude to trade, commerce or business, or any service in relation to such
activities. It only enjoined the GPU charities from involving themselves
from carrying on of any activity for profit132 (which was interpreted in
Surat Art Silk1). This substantial change brought about by the
amendments of 2008-2012 and 2015 is the prohibition from engaging
in any kind of activity in the nature of business, commerce, or trade or
any rendering any service in relation thereto, and earning income by
the way of cess, fee or consideration. In the opinion of this Court, the
express deletion of the reference to "activity for profit" on the one hand,
and the enactment of an expanded list of what cannot be done by GPU
charities if they are to retain their characteristic as charities, is an
emphatic manner in which Parliament wished to express itself.
155. The counsel on both sides went to great lengths and cited
several judgments for the proposition that "trade or business" are
terms which imply profit-making. They relied on Khoday Distilleries40,
Raipur Mfg. Port of Madras56, and Physical Research Laboratory V.
K.G. SharmaÂ¹33 It was contended by the Revenue, that the reference
to terms "business, trade or commerce" and "service in relation to"
such activities are meant to imply that profit motive should be
completely absent. At the same time-on behalf of the assessees, it
was contented that if the proscribed activities i.e. business, commerce
or trade or service in relation to such activities-is not the main or
dominant object of the GPU charity, any incidental involvement in such
activities is permissible. The counsel on behalf of many assessees urged
that some of them are statutory corporations charged with developing
housing industrial infrastructure sector, regulation of professions (such
as chartered accountants, etc.). It was underlined that such
corporations are agencies of the State, recognised as "State" under
Article 12 of the Constitution, and carry out the essential purposes for
which they were set up, which otherwise State departments would have
been expected to carry out. It was then emphasised that the activities
of such corporations cannot be characterised as motivated by profit-
rather their essential purposes are to achieve objects of general public
utility.
156. In Town Investments Ltd. V. Deptt. of Environment134, it was
remarked that "business" is an "etymological chameleon". In NDMC28
while dealing with the question of immunity of States and State
corporations, municipal corporations and local authorities from Union
taxation, this Court (in a nine-Judge Bench composition) interpreted
Article 289 of the Constitution13 and discussed the nature of the
activities that could be carried on by State or State agencies : (NDMC
28
"173.
Section 155(1) which by its own force levied taxes upon
the trading and business operations carried on by the Provincial
Governments did not either define the said expressions or specify
which trading or business operations are subject to taxation. On this
account, the proviso was not and could not be said to have been,
ineffective or unenforceable. It was effective till 26-1-1950. Clause
(2) of Article 289 also similarly does not define or specify - nor does
it require that the law made thereunder should so define or specify.
It cannot be said that unless the law made under and with reference
to clause (2) specifies the particular trading or business operations
to be taxed, it would not be a law within the meaning of clause (2).
Coming back to the language of clause (2), a question is raised, why
does the proviso speak of taxation in respect of trade or business
when the main limb of sub-section (1) speaks only of taxes in
respect of lands or buildings and income? Is the ambit of proviso
wider than the main limb? Is it an independent provision of a
substantive nature notwithstanding the label given to it as a proviso?
Or is it only an exception? It is asked. We are, however, of the
considered opinion that it is more important to give effect to the
language of and the intention underlying the proviso than to find a
label for it. It is clarificatory in nature without a doubt; it appears to
be more indeed. It is concerned mainly with the "income" (of
Provincial Governments) referred to in the main limb of sub-section
(1). It speaks of tax on the "lands or buildings" in that context
alone, as we shall explain in the next paragraph. The idea underlying
the proviso is to make it clear that the exemption of income of
Provincial Government operates only where the income is earned or
received by it as a Government; it will not avail where the income is
earned or received by the Provincial Government on account of or
from any trade or business carried on by it - that is a trade or a
business carried on with profit motive. In the light of the language of
the proviso to Section 155 and clause (2) of Article 289, it is not
possible to say that every activity carried on by the Government is
governmental activity. A distinction has to be made between
governmental activity and trade and business carried on by the
Government, at least for the purposes of this clause. It is for this
reason, we say, that unless an activity in the nature of trade and
business is carried on with a profit motive, it would not be a trade or
business contemplated by clause (2). For example, mere sale of
government properties, immovable or movable, or granting of leases
and licences in respect of its properties does not amount to carrying
on trade or business. Only where a trade or business is carried on
with a profit motive - or any property is used or occupied for the
purpose of carrying on such trade or business - that the proviso [or
for that matter clause (2) of Article 289] would be attracted. Where
there is no profit motive involved in any activity carried on by the
State Government, it cannot be said to be carrying on a trade or
business within the meaning of the proviso/
clause (2), merely because some profit results from the activity 28a We
may pause here a while and explain why we are attaching such
restricted meaning to the words "trade or business" in the proviso to
Section 155 and in clause (2) of Article 289. Both the words import
substantially the same idea though, ordinarily speaking, the expression
"business" appears to be wider in its content. The expression, however,
has no definite meaning; its meaning varies with the context and
several other factors.
Having regard to the context in which the
words "trade or business" occur - whether in the proviso to Section
155 of the Government of India Act, 1935 or in clause (2) of Article 289
of our Constitution - they must be given, and we have given, a
restricted meaning, the context being levy of tax by one unit of
Federation upon the income of the other unit, the manifold activities
carried on by Governments under our constitutional scheme, the
necessity to maintain a balance between the Centre and the States and
so on."
(emphasis in original and supplied)
157. From NDMC2 it is clear that not every State activity
resembling commerce can be considered per se exempt from Union
taxation, in the context of Article 289. The Court also emphasised that
mere sale or lease of government property does not imply trade or
business. The crucial or determinative element in the venture, so to
say, is whether performance of a function is actuated by profit motive.
158. What then is the true meaning of the expressions "fee, cess or
consideration"? The careful analysis of the amended proviso to Section
2(15), reveals that the prohibition applies in a fourfold manner-
(a) The bar to engaging in trade, commerce or business,
(b) The bar to providing any service in relation to trade,
commerce or business,
(c) wherein "for a fee, cess or any other consideration" is the
controlling phrase for both (a) and (b) (which are collectively
referred to as "prohibited activities" for brevity),
(d) irrespective of the application of the income derived from such
"prohibited activities".
159. The impermissibility of any trade, or commercial activity or
service, and income, from them, was intended to be conveyed through
the prohibition, in the first part of the definition of GPU charities. The
necessary implication which arises is that income (received as fee, cess,
or any other consideration) derived from such "prohibited activities" is
necessarily motivated by profit. The ordinary meaning of fee or
consideration would be synonymous with something of value, usually in
monetary terms. However, the use of the expression "cess" facially
lends a different colour to all the three expressions.
160. "Fee, cess and any other consideration" has to receive a
purposive interpretation, in the present context. If fee or cess or such
consideration is collected for the purpose of an activity, by a State
department or entity, which is set up by the statute, its mandate to
collect such amounts cannot be treated as consideration towards trade
or business. Therefore, regulatory activity, necessitating fee or cess
collection in terms of the enacted law, or collection of amounts in
furtherance of activities such as education, regulation of profession, etc.
are per se not business or commercial in nature. Likewise, statutory
boards and authorities, who are under mandate to develop housing,
industrial and other estates, including development of residential
housing at reasonable or subsidised costs, which might entail charging
higher amounts from some section of the beneficiaries, to cross-
subsidise the main activity, cannot be characterised as engaging in
business. The character of being "State", and such corporations or
bodies set up under specific laws (whether by States or the Centre)
would, therefore, not mean that the amounts are "fee" or "cess" to
provide some commercial or business service. In each case, at the
same time, the mere nomenclature of the consideration being a "fee" or
"cess", is not conclusive. If the fee or cess, or other consideration is to
provide an essential service, in larger public interest, such as water
cess or sewage cess or fee, such consideration, received by a statutory
body, would not be considered "trade, commerce or business" or
service in relation to those. Non-statutory bodies, on the other hand,
which may mimic regulatory or development bodies - such as those
which promote trade, for a section of business or industry, or are aimed
at providing facilities or amenities to improve efficiencies, or platforms
to a segment of business, for fee, whether charged by subscription, or
specific fee, etc. may not be charitable; when they claim exemption,
their cases would require further scrutiny.
161. This Court has in some decisions considered the term "cess". In
Shinde Bros. V. Commr.136, , M. Hidayatullah, J. (though his was a
dissenting judgment, yet no contrary opinion was expressed by the
majority in regard to "cess") said that : (AIR p. 1525, para 39)
"... " The word "cess" is used in Ireland and is still in use in India
although the word rate has replaced it in England. It means a tax
and is generally used when the levy is for some special
administrative expense which the name (health cess, education cess,
road cess, etc.) indicates.
When levied as an increment to an existing tax, the name matters not
for the validity of the cess must be judged of in the same way as the
validity of the tax to which it is an increment. By Schedule A(1) read
with Section 3 of the Act, it is collected as an additional levy with a tax,
which, as described in Schedule A, is undoubtedly one within the
powers of the State Legislature and has been so even prior to the
Constitution."
162. The seven-Judge Bench judgment of this Court in India Cement
Ltd. V. State of T.N.137, , approved the definition propounded by
Hidayatullah, J. In Vijayalashmi Rice Mill V. CTO138 this Court observed
"13. Hence ordinarily a cess is also a tax, but is a special kind
of
tax. Generally tax raises revenue which can be used generally for any
purpose by the State. For instance, the income tax or excise tax or
sales tax are taxes which generate revenue which can be utilised by
the Union or the State Governments for any purpose e.g. for
payment of salary to the members of the armed forces or civil
servants, police, etc. or for development programmes, etc. However,
cess is a tax which generates revenue which is utilised for a specific
purpose. For instance, health cess raises revenue which is utilised for
health purposes e.g. building hospitals, giving medicines to the poor,
etc. Similarly, education cess raises revenue which is used for
building schools or other educational purposes."
1 The expression "cess", therefore, implies a tax or impost levied
for some special purpose, which may be levied as an increment to an
existing tax. The term "fee", to some extent, has a similar meaning. In
139
CIT
V. U.P. Forest Corpn. this Court, after considering other previous
decisions, held that exaction, through process of law, of amounts may
"11.
`11.
compulsory exactions of money imposed for public
purpose and requiring no consideration to sustain it, but in a broad
generic sense as to also include fees levied essentially for services
rendered. It is now well recognised that there is no generic
difference between a tax and a fee; both are compulsory exactions of
money by public authority.'1 ,139a
164. At the same time, there is also authority 140 for the proposition
that charges (which may be termed as "fee" in given statutes) collected
by local or municipal authorities, for supply of water, for sewerage, etc.
are not "taxes"
- they form consideration for the specific services, by the local
authority concerned.
165. The term "consideration" however is broader. The plain
meaning is a monetary payment, for something obtained, in the form of
goods, or services. In CCE V. Fiat India (P) Ltd. 141 this Court explained
"68.
Consideration means something which is of value in the
eye of the law, moving from the plaintiff, either of benefit to the
plaintiff or of detriment to the defendant. In other words, it may
consist either in some right, interest, profit or benefit accruing to the
one party, or some forbearance, detriment, loss or responsibility,
given, suffered or undertaken by the other, as observed in Currie V.
MisaÂ¹42
69. Webster's Third New International Dictionary (unabridged)
defines. "consideration" thus:
'Something that is legally regarded as the equivalent or return
given or suffered by one for the act or promise of another.'
70. In Vol. 17 of Corpus Juris Secundum (pp. 420-21 and 425)
the import of "consideration" has been described thus:
'Various definitions of the meaning of "consideration" are to be
found in the textbooks and judicial opinions. A sufficient one, as
stated in Corpus Juris and which has been quoted and cited with
approval is "a benefit to the party promising or a loss or detriment
to the party to whom the promise is made..
"
At common law every contract not under seal requires a
consideration to support it, that is, as shown in the definition above,
some benefit to the promisor, or some detriment to the promisee."
71. In Salmond on Jurisprudence, the word "consideration" has
been explained in the following words:
'A consideration in its widest sense is the reason, motive or
inducement, by which a man is moved to bind himself by an
agreement. It is for nothing that he consents to impose an
obligation upon himself, or to abandon or transfer a right. It is in
consideration of such and such a fact that he agrees to bear new
burdens or to forego the benefits which the law already allows
him.'
72. The gist of the term "consideration" and its legal significance
has been clearly summed up in Section 2(d) of the Contract Act
which defines "consideration" thus:
'2. (d) When, at the desire of the promisor, the promisee or
any other person has done or abstained from doing or does or
abstains from doing, or
promises to do or to abstain from doing, something, such act or
abstinence or promise is called a consideration for the promise."
73. From a conspectus of decisions and dictionary meaning, the
inescapable conclusion that follows is that "consideration" means a
reasonable equivalent or other valuable benefit passed on by the
promisor to the promisee or by the transferor to the transferee.
Similarly, when the word "consideration" is qualified by the word
"sole", it makes consideration stronger so as to make it sufficient
and valuable having regard to the facts, circumstances and
necessities of the case."
166. Therefore, what Parliament intended - through the
amendments in question was to proscribe, involvement or engagement
of GPU charities, from any form ("in the nature of") of activities that
were trade, business or commerce, or engage or involve in providing
services in relation to trade, business or commerce - for a fee, cess or
other consideration. The inclusion of the term "in the nature of" was by
design, to clarify beyond doubt, that not only business, trade or
commerce, but all activities in the nature of, or resembling them, were
proscribed. Likewise, service in relation to such activities i.e. services
relating, or pertaining to, such proscribed activities, too were forbidden.
167. The reference to fee or cess, is in the opinion of the Court, only
to emphasise that even a statutory consideration, for a service to
business, trade or commerce, would take the activity outside the
definition of a GPU charity. The sense in which the expressions "cess,
fee or other consideration" are used, is that if any amount, is received
for trading, or business or commercial activity, or any services to such
activity, then, notwithstanding their nomenclature (as fee or cess i.e.
that they are fixed under a law) the GPU charity cannot claim tax
exempt status. To bring home this even more pointedly - and
underline a break from the past, the application of such amounts
(received in the course of trade, commerce, or business, or towards
services in relation thereto) would be irrelevant, as evidenced by the
term "irrespective", in the fourth limb of reading Section 2(15).
Summation of interpretation of Section 2(15)
168. Section 2(15)-in the wake of its several amendments between
2008 and 2015-can be juxtaposed with the interpretation of the
unamended Section 2(15) by this Court. In Surat Art Silk1, the
principle enunciated was that so long as the predominant object of GPU
category charity is charitable, its engagement in a non-charitable object
resulting in profits that are incidental, is permissible. The Court also
declared that profits and gains from such activities which were non-
charitable had to be deployed or "fed" back to achieve the dominant
charitable object.
169. The paradigm change achieved by Section 2(15) after its
amendment in 2008 and as it stands today, is that firstly a GPU charity
cannot engage in any activity in the nature of trade, commerce,
business or any service in relation to such activities for any
consideration (including a statutory fee, etc.).
This is emphasised in the negative language employed by the main
part of Section 2(15). Therefore, the idea of a predominant object
among several other objects, is discarded. The prohibition is relieved to
a limited extent, by the proviso which carves out the condition by which
otherwise prohibited activities can be engaged in by GPU charities. The
conditions are:
169.1. That such activities in the nature of trade, commerce,
business or service (in relation to trade, commerce or business for
consideration) should be in the course of "actual carrying on" of the
GPU object.
169.2. The quantum of receipts from such activities should not
exceed 20% of the total receipts.
169.3. Both parts of the proviso : (i) and (ii) [to Section 2(15)]
have to be read conjunctively-given the conscious use of "or"
connecting the two of them. This means that if a charitable trust carries
on any activity in the nature of business, trade or commerce, in the
actual course of fulfilling its objectives, the income from such business,
should not exceed the limit defined in sub-clause (ii) to the proviso.
C. Sections 10, 11, 12, 12-A, 12-AA and 13 of the IT Act
170. The effect of Sections 11, 12, 12-A 12-AA and 13 has been the
subject of certain decisions143 of this Court. These decisions have
noticed that Section 11 deals with income from trusts for charitable and
religious purposes and sets out which shall be subject to tax.
170.1. Section 11(1) relates to application of income towards the
objects of the trust and exempts income of trusts with objects wholly
charitable or religious, or parts of income which relate to such objects.
Section 11(1-A) provides for exemption of capital gains derived by
trusts. Section 11(1-B), speaks of failure to apply income as per option
under Explanation (2) to Section 11(1). Section (2) relates to setting
apart or accumulation of income. Section 11(3) deals with
consequences of misapplication of income or improper investment,
while Section 11(3-A) relates to modification of purposes specified in
Form 10 under Section 11(2). Sections 11(4) and 11(4-A) relate to
business income of charitable trusts. Lastly, Section 11(5) provides for
the prescribed modes of investment in regard to the said trusts.
170.2. Section 12 enacts that income of trusts created wholly for
charitable or religious purpose from voluntary contributions would be
deemed as income from the property held under such trust for the
purposes of Sections 11 and 13 of the Act. Section 12-A prescribes the
conditions for applicability of Sections 11 and 12 of the Act. It enacts
two essential conditions which are to be satisfied by a charitable or
religious trust for claiming exemption under those sections : firstly,
that the person in receipt of the income has made an application for
registration of the trust on or after 1-6-2007 in the prescribed form and
manner to the Commissioner and such a trust is registered under
Section 12-AA and
secondly, where the total income of the trust exceeds the maximum
amount which is not chargeable to income tax in any previous year, the
accounts of the trust must be audited by a chartered accountant and
the person in receipt of the income should furnish such audit report in
the prescribed form along with the return of income. The procedure for
grant (or refusal) of registration is prescribed by Section 12-AA.
170.3. Section 13 enlists the circumstances under which tax
exemption is unavailable to religious or charitable trusts otherwise
falling under Sections 11 or 12. Section 13 therefore, has to be read
with the provisions of Sections 11 and 12 for deciding eligibility of a
trust's claim for exemption.
Distinction between business held under trust [Section 11(4)]
and trust carrying on business [Section 11(4-A)]
171. Section 11(4) applies to cases where the business undertaking
itself is the property held by a trust. Thus, where the property held in
trust, or where property settled by the donor or trust creator in favour
of the trustees itself is a business undertaking, then the income from
such an undertaking is covered by Section 11(4). Section 11(4-A)
operates differently. It is applicable to cases where the trust carries on
a business. Section 11(4-A) states that when a trust carries on a
business, unless the business is incidental or ancillary to the
attainments of the objectives of the trust, it would be disentitled to an
exemption under Section 11(1). It imposes a further condition that
separate books of accounts need to be maintained in such cases.
172. Section 11(1) confers an exemption from tax only where the
property itself is held under a trust or other legal obligation. It does not
apply to cases where a trust or legal obligation is not created on any
property, but only the income derived from any particular property or
source is set apart and charged for a charitable or religious purpose.
Similarly, when a business itself has been set aside for the objects of
the trust, then such business is held under trust and will fall under sub-
section (4). However, where the profits of a business of a trust are
applied for charitable purposes, then such business and trust will be
governed by sub-section (4-A).
173. Section 11(1) of the Act exempts income derived from property
held under trust wholly for charitable or religious purposes, to the
extent to which such income is applied to such purposes in India. The
Act does not comprehensively define "property held under trust".
Section 11(4) however, provides that for the purposes of Section 11,
the words "property held under trust" "includes a business undertaking
so held". Section 11(4-A) as amended by the Finance (No. 2) Act, 1991
w.e.f. 1-4-1992 reads as under:
"11. (4-A) Sub-section (1) or sub-section (2) or sub-section (3)
or sub-section (3-A) shall not apply in relation to any income of a
trust or an institution, being profits and gains of business, unless the
business is incidental to the attainment of the objectives of the trust
or, as the case may be, institution, and separate books of account
are maintained by such trust or institution in respect of such
business."
174. The question whether Section 11(4-A) applies where a
business is held under trust was answered in the negative in earlier
High Court judgments. The general provision under Section 4(3)(i) of
the old Act exempted income derived from property held under trust
from taxation. Section 4(3)(ia) however, enacted that any income
derived from a business carried on behalf of a religious or charitable
trust would be entitled to exemption only if the business was carried on
in the course of carrying out of a primary purpose of the trust or the
work in connection with the business is mainly carried on by the
beneficiaries of the trust. The Revenue contended there that since
clause (ia) was a special provision dealing with exemption in respect of
a business carried on for and on behalf of a trust, any claim for
exemption as regards the profits of such business can be made only
under that provision, and if conditions laid down therein are not
satisfied, the assessee cannot rely upon the general provision contained
in Section 4(3)(i) to claim exemption thereunder on the ground that
business is property. In Charitable Gadodia Swadeshi Stores V. CITÂ°,
the Lahore High Court held that the fact that the business carried on
behalf of the trust failed to satisfy the two conditions in Section 4(3)
(ia) was no reason for it be denied exemption if it fell within Section 4
(3)(i). The Court held that that the two categories mentioned in the two
clauses did not exclude each other.
175. This judgment 8 of the Lahore High Court was approved - by
reference by this Court in J.K. Trust V. CIT144 which was followed in
Krishna Warriar10. By then the content of Section 4(3)(ia) had been
enacted as a proviso to clause (i) of Section 4(3), by amending Act of
1953. After referring to the judgment of the Lahore High Court and
rejecting the argument of the Revenue that a proviso in a statute be
always read as limitation upon the effect of the main enactment
Subbarao, J. in Krishna Warriar10 observed as under : (Krishna Warriar
case 10 , SCR pp. 44-45)
"
But it is not an inflexible rule of construction that a proviso in a
statute should always be read as a limitation upon the effect of the
main enactment. Generally the natural presumption is that but for
the proviso the enacting part of the section would have included the
subject-matter of the proviso; but the clear language of the
substantive provision as well as the proviso may establish that the
proviso is not a qualifying clause of the main provisions, but is in
itself a substantive provision. In the words of Maxwell, "the true
principle is that the sound view of the enacting clause, the saving
clause and the proviso taken and construed together is to prevail".
So construed we find no difficulty, as we will indicate later in our
judgment, in holding that the said clause (b) of the proviso deals
with a case of business which is not vested in trust for religious or
charitable purposes within the meaning of the substantive clause of
Section 4(3)(i)."
176. Therefore, to summarise on the legal position on this - if a
property is held under trust, and such property is a business, the case
would fall under Section 11(4) and not under Section 11(4-A) of the
Act. Section 11(4-A) of the Act, would apply only to a case where the
business is not held under trust. There is a difference between a
property or business held under trust and a business carried on by or
on behalf of the trust. This distinction was recognised in Surat Art Silk1,
which observed that if a business undertaking is held under trust for a
charitable purpose, the income from it would be entitled to exemption
under Section 11(1) of the Act.
177. The interface between Sections 11 (1) and (4) is of some
importance. Firstly, under Section 11(4), it is only the business which
is held under the trust that would enjoy exemption in respect of its
income under Section 11(1). Secondly, there is a distinction between
the objects of a trust and the powers given to the trustees to effectuate
the purposes of the trust. In this regard, the observations of this Court,
in J.K. Trust144 assume relevance. There, one of the questions which
arose was whether the office of managing agency, which was an office
of profit, was in fact settled upon trust and, therefore, could be
considered to be business held under trust. The Court held that for the
purposes of Section 4(3)(i) of the 1922 Act, the office of managing
agency was property which could be held under trust. The Revenue
pointed out that on the terms of the trust deed previously executed by
the settlors (on 15-6-1945), the properties which the trustees are to
hold and stand possessed of, were only the sum of Rs 1,00,000, any
donations and contribution received by the trustees and all accretions
thereto, and investment in securities made from time to time
representing the accretions. It was contended that on the terms of the
trust deed, the managing agency which was acquired on 10-9-1945 for
a period of 20 years, cannot be said to be property held under trust
since no part of the initial amount of Rs 1,00,000, which was settled
upon the trust, was utilised in the acquisition of the managing agency,
so as to impress it with the character of accretion.
178. While repelling this contention, this Court held that : (J.K.
Trust case144 144 , AIR pp. 850-51, para 15)
"15.
But it is to be observed that clause (3) of the trust deed
expressly provides for the acquisition of the business of managing
agency on behalf of the trust and "with the help of the trust fund"
and that precisely is what has happened and indeed, reading
together Exts. A and B, it is impossible to resist the conclusion that
both the documents formed part of an integral scheme, and that
what the settlors had in view in clause (3) of Ext. A is the very
managing agency, which was acquired under Ext. B.
There is considerable authority in England that when trustees
carry on business with the aid of trust fund, the position in law is the
same as if they actually employed it in the business, though, in fact,
it be not actually invested therein."
179. It seems that the test applied in J.K. Trust144 that for
a
business, to be considered as property held under trust, it should have
been either acquired with the help of the fund originally settled upon
trust or the original fund settled upon trust must have a proximate
connection with the later acquisition or carrying on of the business by
the trustees. This distinction between a business held and carried on by
a trust, or a trust business run by the trustees, was noticed, in
Thiagesar Dharma Vanikam V. CIT145 by the Madras High Court and in
P.C. Lall Chaudhary V. CIT146 by the Patna High Court which held
similarly in relation to Section 4(3)(i) of the Act of 1922 [which
corresponds to Section 11(1) of the 1961 Act].
180. What has to be examined, therefore, is whether the business
itself is held under trust or is carried on by and on behalf of the trust.
Importantly Section 11(1) of the Act starts with the expression "subject
to the provisions of Sections 60 to  " Those provisions are in
Chapter V of the Act. Section 60 provides for the consequences of a
transfer of income where there is no transfer of assets. It says that
where a person transfers merely the income from an asset without
transferring the asset itself, he would continue to be chargeable to
income tax. Section 61 provides for the consequences of a revocable
transfer of assets and says that the same would be the position where a
person is in receipt of income by virtue of a revocable transfer of assets.
Section 62 provides for the consequences of a transfer of assets for a
specified period, and serves as an exception to Section 61. An assessee
has to be divested of the asset before ceasing to be assessable in
respect of the income from it. A mere direction that the income from
the business shall be applied to the charitable objects of a trust,
without there being a settlement of the business itself upon trust, does
not result in any trust or legal obligation.
181. It is now, necessary to consider Thanthi Trust* and its context.
This Court, while interpreting Section 11 (4-A) (as amended w.e.f. 1-4-
1992) stated that the provision requires the "business income of a trust
or institution to be exempt is that the business should be incidental to
para 25).
182. The above observations have to be understood in the light of
the facts before the Court. Thanthi Trust carried on newspaper business
which was held under trust. The charitable object of the Trust was the
imparting of education - which falls under Section 2(15) of the Act.
The newspaper business was incidental to the attainment of the object
of the Trust, namely, that of imparting education. This aspect is
important, because the aim of the Trust was a per se charitable object,
not a GPU object. The observations were therefore made, having regard
to the fact that the profits of the newspaper business were utilised by
the Trust for achieving the object of education. In the light of such
facts,
the carrying on of newspaper business, could be incidental to the object
of education-a per se category. The Thanthi Trust ratio therefore,
cannot be extended to cases where the trust carries on business which
is not held under trust and whose income is utilised to feed the
charitable objects of the trust.
183. What then is the interpretation of the expression "incidental"
profits, from "business" being "incidental to the attainment of the
objectives" of the GPU charity [which occurs in Section 11(4-A)]? As
stated earlier, the interpretation of that expression in Thanthi Trust
was in the context of a per se charity i.e. where the Trust's object was
education. However, the restrictive or negative terms enjoining GPU
charities from carrying on profitable activity had been deleted in 1983
(w.e.f. 1-4-1984). In Surat Art Silk1, the Court had articulated the
determinative test for defining whether a trust was a GPU charity if its
predominant object was to carry out a charitable purpose and that if
that was the case, the fact that it earned profit would not per se
deprive it of tax exemption. This decision was interpreted in the context
of Section 11(4-A) by this Court in Thanthi Trust to hold that business
can be incidental to attainment of the trust's objects.
184. Thus, the journey which began with Surat Art Silk1 was
interpreted in Thanthi Trust to mean that the carrying on of business
by GPU charity was permissible as long as it inured to the benefit of the
trust. The change brought about by the amendments in questions,
however, place the focus on an entirely different perspective : that if at
all any activity in the nature of trade, commerce or business, or a
service in the nature of the same, for any form of consideration is
permissible, that activity should be intrinsically linked to, or a part of
the GPU category charity's object. Thus, the test of the charity being
driven by a predominant object is no longer good law. Likewise, the
ambiguity with respect to the kind of activities generating profit which
could feed the main object and incidental profit-making also is not good
law. What instead, the definition under Section 2(15) through its
proviso directs and thereby marks a departure from the previous law, is
- firstly that if a GPU charity is to engage in any activity in the nature
of trade, commerce or business, for consideration it should only be a
part of this actual function to attain the GPU objective and, secondly -
and the equally important consideration is the imposition of a
quantitative standard - i.e. income (fees, cess or other consideration)
derived from activity in the nature of trade, business or commerce or
service in relation to these three activities, should not exceed the
quantitative limit of Rs 10,00,000 (w.e.f. 1-4-2009), Rs 25,00,000
(w.e.f. 1-4-2012), and 20% (w.e.f. 1-4-2016) of the total receipts.
Lastly, the "ploughing" back of business income to "feed" charity is an
irrelevant factor - again emphasising the prohibition from engaging in
trade, commerce or business.
185. If one understands the definition in the light of the above
enunciation, the sequitur is that the reference to "income being profits
and gains of business" with a further reference to its being incidental to
the objects of the trust,
cannot and does not mean proceeds of activities incidental to the main
object, incidental objects or income derived from incidental activities.
The proper way of reading reference to the term "incidental" in Section
11(4-A) is to interpret it in the light of sub-clause (i) of proviso to
Section 2(15) i.e. that the activity in the nature of business, trade,
commerce or service in relation to such activities should be conducted
actually in the course of achieving the GPU object, and the income,
profit or surplus or gains can then, be logically incidental. The
amendment of 2016, inserting sub-clause (i) to proviso to Section 2
(15) was therefore clarificatory. Thus interpreted, there is no conflict
between the definition of charitable purpose and the machinery part of
Section 11(4-A). Further, the obligation under Section 11(4-A) to
maintain separate books of account in respect of such receipts is to
ensure that the quantitative limit imposed by sub-clause (ii) to Section
2(15) can be computed and ascertained in an objective manner.
186. The conclusion recorded above is also supported by the
language of seventh provisoÂ¹4 to Section 10(23-C). Whereas Section 2
(15) is the definition clause, Section 10 lists out what is not income.
Section 10(23-C) - by sub-clauses (iv) and (v) exempt incomes of
charitable organisations. Such organisations and institutions are not
limited to GPU category charities but rather extend to other types of
charities (i.e. the per se kind as well). The controlling part of Section 10
(23-C) along with the relevant clauses (iv) and (v) seek to exclude
income received by the charities concerned. However, the provisos
hedge such exemption with conditions. The seventh proviso-much like
Section 11(4-A) and the definition-carves - out an exception, to the
exemptions such that income derived by charities from business, are
not exempt. The seventh proviso virtually echoes Section 11(4-A) in
that business income derived by a charity (in the present case, the GPU
charities) which arises from an activity incidental to the attainment of
its objective is not per se excluded.
187. Classically, the idea of charity was tied up with
teleemosynary148. However, "charitable purpose" - and charity as
148
defined in the Act have a wider meaning where it is the object of the
institution which is in focus. Thus, the idea of providing services or
goods at no consideration, cost or nominal consideration is not confined
to the provision of services or goods without
charging anything or charging a token or nominal amount. This is spelt
332, para 14) that certain GPUs can render services to the public with
the condition that they would not charge
"14.
more than is actually needed for the rendering of the
services, - may be it may not be an exact equivalent, such
mathematical precision being impossible in the case of variables, -
may be a little surplus is left over at the end of the year - the broad
inhibition against making profit is a good guarantee that the carrying
on of the activity is not for profit."
(emphasis in original)
188. Therefore, pure charity in the sense that the performance of an
activity without any consideration is not envisioned under the Act. If
one keeps this in mind, what Section 2(15) emphasises is that so long
as a GPU's charity's object involves activities which also generates
profits (incidental, or in other words, while actually carrying out the
objectives of GPU, if some profit is generated), it can be granted
exemption provided the quantitative limit (of not exceeding 20%)
under the second proviso to Section 2(15) for receipts from such
profits, is adhered to.
189. Yet another manner of looking at the definition together with
Sections 10(23) and 11 is that for achieving a general public utility
object, if the charity involves itself in activities, that entail charging
amounts only at cost or marginal markup over cost, and also derive
some profit, the prohibition against carrying on business or service
relating to business is not attracted - if the quantum of such profits do
not exceed 20% of its overall receipts.
190. It may be useful to conclude this section on interpretation with
some illustrations. The example of Gandhi Peace Foundation
disseminating Mahatma Gandhi's philosophy (in Surat Art Silk1)
through museums and exhibitions and publishing his works, for
nominal cost, ipso facto is not business. Likewise, providing access to
low-cost hostels to weaker segments of society, where the fee or
charges recovered cover the costs (including administrative
expenditure) plus nominal markup; or renting marriage halls for low
amounts, again with a fee meant to cover costs; or blood bank services,
again with fee to cover costs, are not activities in the nature of
business. Yet, when the entity concerned charges substantial
amounts-over and above the cost it incurs for doing the same work, or
work which is part of its object (i.e. publishing an expensive coffee
table book on Gandhi, or in the case of the marriage hall, charging
significant amounts from those who can afford to pay, by providing
extra services, far above the cost plus nominal markup) such activities
are in the nature of trade, commerce, business or service in relation to
them. In such case, the receipts from such latter kind of activities
where higher amounts are charged, should not exceed the limit
indicated by proviso (ii) to Section 2 (15).
191. The insertion of Section 13(8)149, the seventeenth proviso to
Section 10(23-C) and the third proviso to Section 143(3) (all of which
were inserted by Finance Act, 2012, but w.r.e.f. 1-4-2009), further
reinforces the interpretation of this Court, of "charitable purpose".
These provisions, form the machinery to control the conditions under
which income is exempt. The effect of the seventeenth proviso to
Section 10(23-C) is to impose the same condition i.e. that that the
trade, commerce or business activity or service relating to trade,
business or commerce, should be part of the GPU's activities, to achieve
its object of advancing general public utility. The other condition-
which is drawn in as part of the exemption condition, is that if such
trading or commercial activity takes place the receipts should be
confined to a prescribed percentage of the overall receipts. Section 13
(8) too reinforces the same condition.
192. In the opinion of this Court, the change intended by Parliament
through the amendment of Section 2(15) was sought to be emphasised
and clarified by the amendment of Section 10(23-C) and the insertion
of Section 13(8). This was Parliament's emphatic way of saying that
generally no commercial or business or trading activity ought to be
engaged by GPU charities but that in the course of their functioning of
carrying out activities of general public utility, they can in a limited
manner do so, provided the receipts are within the limit spelt out in
clause (ii) of the proviso to Section 2(15).
D. What kinds of income or receipts may not be characterised as
derived from trade, commerce, business or in relation to such
activities, for a consideration
(i) Statutory corporations, authorities or bodies
193. It would be essential now to deal with certain kinds of receipts
which GPU charities, typically statutory housing boards, regulatory
authorities and corporations may be entitled to, if mandated to collect
or receive. During the course of hearing, the learned counsel
highlighted that statutory boards, and corporations have to recover the
cost of providing essential goods and services in public interest, and
also fund large-scale development and maintain public property. These
would entail recovering charges or fees, interest and also receiving
interest for holding deposits. It was further pointed out that in some
cases, income in the form of rents - having regard to the nature of the
schemes which the board, trust or corporation concerned may be
mandated or permitted to carry on, has to be received. For instance, in
some situations, for certain kinds of properties, the boards may be
permitted only to lease out their assets and receive rents.
194. The answers to these, in the opinion of this Court, are that the
definition ipso facto does not spell out whether certain kinds of income
can be excluded. However, the reference to specific provisions enabling
or mandating collection of certain rates, tariffs or costs would have to
be examined. Generically, going by statutory models in enactments
(under which corporations boards or trust or authority by whatsoever
name, are set up), the mere fact that these bodies have to charge
amounts towards supplying goods or articles, or rendering services i.e.
for fees for providing typical essential services like providing water,
distribution of foodgrains, distribution of medicines, maintenance of
roads, parks, etc. ought not to be characterised as "commercial
receipts". The rationale for such exclusion would be that if such rates,
fees, tariffs, etc. determined by statutes and collected for essential
services, are included in the overall income as receipts as part of trade,
commerce or business, the quantitative limit of 20% imposed by the
second proviso to Section 2(15) would be attracted thereby negating
the essential general public utility object and thus driving up the costs
to be borne by the ultimate user or consumer which is the general
public. By way of illustration, if a corporation supplies essential
foodgrains at cost, or a marginal markup, another supplies essential
medicines, and a third, water, the characterisation of these, as
activities in the nature of business, would be self-defeating, because
the overall receipts in some given cases may exceed the quantitative
limit resulting in taxation and the consequent higher consideration
charged from the user or consumer.
(a) Interpretation of Section 10(46) and Section 2(15)
195. Clause (20-A) to Section 10 was inserted by the Finance Act,
1970 with effect from 1-4-1962. It had excluded certain classes of
income, of corporations150. This Court had occasion to deal with the
provision while it was in force in the GIDC caseÂ³4 The Court had then
emphasised that the expression "development" in Section 10(20-A)
should be understood widely; thus, all development programmes
"relating to any industry" fell within the purview of "development". The
Court also highlighted that nothing in the IT Act laid down how a
corporation could be termed as a development corporation nor was
there anything mandating that fee chargeable by such corporations was
confined to non-industrial activities.
196. The decision in Gujarat Maritime Board58 was rendered in the
context of Section 10(20). That provision exempts income accruing to
local authorities, from taxation. By the Finance Act, 2002, an
Explanation was
added to Section 10(20) which defined "local authority" retrospectively.
The Board ceased to enjoy exemption which it had hitherto, in the
absence of the retrospective definition. It, therefore sought exemption,
as a GPU category charity claiming that it was controlled by objects of
general public utility having regard to the provisions of its parent Act
i.e. the Gujarat Maritime Board Act. This Court refuted the argument of
the Revenue that if a corporation did not fall within the definition of
"local authority" it could not claim to be a GPU charity. It was held that
Section 10(20) and Section 11 of the 1961 Act operate in totally
different spheres. Even if the Board is not considered as a local
authority, it is not precluded from claiming exemption under Section 11
(1) of the 1961 Act. Therefore, the Court read Section 11(1) in light of
the definition of the words "charitable purposes" as defined under
Section 2(15). This Court also relied upon the ruling in A.P. SRTC V.
CIT19
where
APSRTC constituted under the Road Transport
Corporation Act, 1950 - having regard to the objectives of the Act, was
held to be a GPU charity, thus entitling it to exemption in terms of the
IT Act.
197. In the light of these decisions, it is evident that the Revenue's
narrow construction by which tax exemption is denied on the ground
that if an entity is not covered by Section 10(20-A) - or the newly
applicable Section 10(46), it cannot claim benefit as a GPU charity
under Section 11, is unsound. These two provisions confer different
though overlapping benefits. If an entity does not fulfil the requirement
of one provision because it does not answer the description of a body
under that provision, that ipso facto is not a bar for it to claim benefit of
another provision.
198. Section 10(46) reincarnated so to say Section 10(20-A), which
had been deleted w.e.f. 1-4-2003. This provision i.e. Section 10(46)
was inserted with effect from 1-4-2009 retrospectively by the Finance
Act, 2011151. The conditions for applicability of Section 10(46) i.e. that
specified income or a class of specified income of ports, trusts or
commissions, etc. established
or constituted by or under Central or State enactments with the object
of regulating or administering any activity in the general public, is on
similar lines as in the case of GPU charities. Like in the case of GPU
charities, there is a prohibition by Section 10(46)(b) against such
corporations, etc. engaging in commercial activity. This restriction has
been introduced for the first time [as that prohibition was absent in the
now repealed Section 10(20-A)].
199. The term "commercial" is closely similar to, if not identical,
with the phrase "in the nature of trade, commerce or business". The
other condition in Section 10(46) is that the specified income to be
exempted, is to be notified by the Central Government in the Official
Gazette. Facially the allusion to commercial activity, appears to be in
the nature of a complete bar to activities which are akin to commerce or
business, yielding profit. However, what needs to be kept in mind is
that the object of Section 10 is to remove from the taxable net, an
entire class of receipts of income. Given this object of Section 10, the
interpretation of "commercial" activity has to be on the same lines as in
the case of income derived by GPU charities, in the course of their
actual functioning, by involving in activities in the nature of trade,
commerce or business. Thus, if statutory corporations within Section 10
(46) derive their income by charging a nominal markup over the cost of
service rendered or goods supplied, meant to recover the costs of the
activities they engage in primarily or to achieve the object for which
they were set up, such as development of housing, road infrastructure,
water supply, sewage treatment, supply of foodgrains, medicines, etc.
with or without regulatory powers, the mere fact that some surplus or
gain is derived would not disentitle them from the benefit of Section 10
(46).
200. In this context, it would be useful to consider the judgment of
the Delhi and Allahabad High Courts in Greater Noida Industrial
Development Authority V. Union of India43 (hereafter "GNIDA") and CIT
V. Yamuna Expressway Industrial Development Authority152 .
152
In
GNIDA43 the High Court drew a distinction between bodies set up by
the Government with commercial purpose and objects - which are
motivated by profit, and other government bodies. The Court held,
correctly so - that other government bodies are not entitled to
exemption as they are motivated by profit. Then, dealing with the term
"commercial activity" under Section 10(46), it was held that the
decisive test is whether the activities for which consideration in the
form of fee, service charge, etc. is collected, is "intrinsically associated,
connected and had minimum nexus with the object of regulating and
administering the activity for the benefit of the public". It was also held
that if the activity is not carried on commercial lines i.e. with the profit
motive in mind, but the body is assigned an administrative role, having
regard to the objects of the controlling statute or law, exemption
cannot be denied under Section 10(46). As juxtaposed, activities for
profit or activities which clearly were motivated by profit - carried on
by Government or statutory bodies, cannot avail of exemption. The
judgment in
Yamuna Expressway Industrial Development Authority 152 is along the
similar lines.
201. As far as boards and corporations which are tasked with
development of industrial areas, by statute, the judgments of this
Court, in Shri Ramtanu Coop. Housing Society33 and Gujarat Industrial
Development Corpn.34 have declared that these bodies are involved in
"development" and are not essentially engaged in trading. In Shri
Ramtanu Coop. Housing Society33 this Court, by a five-Judge Bench,
held that Maharashtra Industrial Development Corpn. 36 is not a trading
concern, and observed as follows : (Shri Ramtanu Coop. Housing
"16. These features of transfer of land, or borrowing of moneys or
receipt of rents and profits will by themselves neither be the indicia
nor the decisive attributes of the trading character of the
Corporation. Ordinarily, a Corporation is established by shareholders
with their capital. The shareholders have their Directors for the
regulation and management of the Corporation. Such a Corporation
set up by the shareholders carries on business and is intended for
making profits. When profits are earned by such a Corporation they
are distributed to shareholders by way of dividends or kept in
reserve funds. In the present case, these attributes of a trading
Corporation are absent. The Corporation is established by the Act for
carrying out the purposes of the Act. The purposes of the Act are
development of industries in the State. The Corporation consists of
nominees of the State Government, State Electricity Board and the
Housing Board. The functions and powers of the Corporation indicate
that the Corporation is acting as a wing of the State Government in
establishing industrial estates and developing industrial areas,
acquiring property for those purposes, constructing buildings,
allotting buildings, factory sheds to industrialists or industrial
undertakings. It is obvious that the Corporation will receive moneys
for disposal of land, buildings and other properties and also that the
Corporation would receive rents and profits in appropriate cases.
Receipts of these moneys arise not out of any business or trade but
out of sole purpose of establishment, growth and development of
industries.
17. The Corporation has to provide amenities and facilities in
industrial estates and industrial areas. Amenities of road, electricity,
sewerage and other facilities in industrial estates and industrial areas
are within the programme of work of the Corporation. The fund of the
Corporation consists of moneys received from the State Government,
all fees, costs and charges received by the Corporation, all moneys
received by the Corporation from the disposal of lands, buildings and
other properties and all moneys received by the Corporation by way
of rents and profits or in any other manner. The Corporation shall
have the authority to spend such
sums out of the general funds of the Corporation or from reserve and
other funds. The Corporation is to make provision for reserve and other
specially denominated funds as the State Government may direct. The
Corporation accepts deposits from persons, authorities or institutions to
whom allotment or sale of land, buildings, or sheds is made or is likely
to be made in furtherance of the object of the Act. A budget is prepared
showing the estimated receipts and expenditure. The accounts of the
The surest way t to legal research!"
Corporation are audited by an auditor appointed by the State
Government. These provisions in regard to the finance of the
Corporation indicate the real role of the Corporation viz. the agency of
the Government in carrying out the purpose and object of the Act which
is the development of industries. If in the ultimate analysis there is
excess of income over expenditure that will not establish the trading
character of the Corporation. There are various departments of the
Government which may have excess of income over expenditure.
*
*
*
20. The underlying concept of a trading Corporation is buying and
selling. There is no aspect of buying or selling by the Corporation in
the present case. The Corporation carries out the purposes of the
Act, namely, development of industries in this State. The
construction of buildings, the establishment of industries by letting
buildings on hire or sale, the acquisition and transfer of land in
relation to establishment of industrial estate or development of
industrial areas and of setting up of industries cannot be said to be
dealing in land or buildings for the obvious reason that the State is
carrying out the objects of the Act with the Corporation as an agent
in setting up industries in the State. The Act aims at building an
industrial town and the Corporation carries out the objects of the
Act. The hard core of a trading Corporation is its commercial
character. Commerce connotes transactions of purchase and sale of
commodities, dealing in goods. The forms of business transactions
may be varied but the real character is buying and selling. The true
character of the Corporation in the present case is to act as an
architectural agent of the development and growth of industrial
towns by establishing and developing industrial estates and
industrial areas. We are of opinion that the Corporation is not a
trading one."
202. In Shri Ramtanu Coop. Housing Society33 no doubt, this Court
did not have to decide whether Maharashtra Industrial Development
Corporation was entitled to tax exemption. However, it examined the
provisions of the Act, and the ratio, that such industrial development
corporations are not engaged in trading, is binding. Like in that case,
here too, the State Acts concerned (the Gujarat Industrial Development
Act, 1962 and the Karnataka Industrial Areas Development Act, 1966)
tasked the boards with planning and development of industrial areas.
Their personnel are appointed under the enactments and are deemed to
be public servants. The State Government is empowered to acquire
land, in exercise of eminent domain power, for their purposes; their
audits are by the Accountant General of the State concerned, or
auditors appointed by the State. They are authorised by law, to levy
rates and charges, for the services they provide, on predetermined
basis. In the light of these provisions, clearly, these boards and
authorities perform objects of general public utility; and they are not
driven by profit motive.
203. There is a twofold distinction between the ow-deleted
Section 10(20-A) and the newly added Section 10(46) (w.e.f. 1-6-
2011). Firstly, that the erstwhile Section 10(20-A) applied to a limited
class of undertaking i.e. the bodies, or corporations, constituted by or
under any law-confined to the planning and development of housing
infrastructure. However, the newly added Section 10(46) is wider in
comparison and the activities of any body or authority or board
constituted by or under any Central or State Act with "the object of
regulating or administering any activity for the benefit of the general
public", has broader import. In a sense, the newly added Section 10
(46), resembles a GPU category charity classified under Section 2(15).
The second distinction is that Section 10(20-A) did not bar any board,
or corporations, etc. from indulging in commercial activities. However,
sub-clause (b) of Section 10(46) imposes such a bar, and the body
concerned cannot claim tax exemption if it engages in commercial
activity.
204. The manner in which GPU charities have been dealt with under
the definition clause i.e. Section 2(15), indicates that even though
trading or commercial activity or service in relation to trade, commerce
or business appears to be barred - nevertheless the ban is lifted
somewhat by the proviso which enables such activities to be carried out
if they are intrinsically part of the activity of achieving the object of
general public utility. Furthermore, in the case of GPU charities there is
a quantified limit of the overall receipts, which is permissible from such
commercial activity. In the case of local authorities and corporations
covered by Section 10(46) no such activities are seemingly permitted.
205. As was observed in the earlier part of this judgment - while
considering whether for the period 1-4-2003 - 31-5-2011, statutory
boards, corporations, etc. could have lawfully claimed to be GPU
charities, this Court has observed that the nature of such corporations
is not to generate profit but to make available goods and other services
for the benefit of public weal. If such corporations [falling within the
description of Section 10(46)] applied to the Central Government for
exemption, the treatment of their receipts, should be no different than
how such receipts can and should have been treated for the purposes of
determining whether they are GPU charities, during the period when
Section 10(46) was not in existence. Furthermore, this Court is of the
opinion that having regard to the observations in Gujarat Maritime
Board case58, the denial of exemption under one category cannot debar
such corporations from claiming income exempt status under another
category.
(b) Summary in relation to statutory authorities/corporations
206. In light of the above discussion, this Court is of the opinion
that:
206.1. The fact that bodies which carry on statutory functions whose
income was eligible to be considered for exemption under Section 10
(20-A) ceased to enjoy that benefit after deletion of that provision
w.e.f. 1-4-2003, does not ipso facto preclude their claim for
consideration for benefit as GPU category charities, under Section 11
read with Section 2(15) of the Act.
206.2. Statutory corporations, boards, authorities, commissions, etc.
(by whatsoever names called) in the housing development, town
planning, industrial development sectors are involved in the
advancement of objects of general public utility, therefore are entitled
to be considered as charities in the GPU categories.
206.3. Such statutory corporations, boards, trusts, authorities, etc.
may be involved in promoting public objects and also in the course of
their pursuing their objects, involved or engaged in activities in the
nature of trade, commerce or business.
206.4. The determinative tests to consider when determining
whether such statutory bodies, boards, authorities, corporations,
autonomous or self-governing government sponsored bodies, are GPU
category charities:
206.4.1. Does the State or Central law, or the memorandum of
association, constitution, etc. advance any GPU object, such as
development of housing, town planning, development of industrial
areas, or regulation of any activity in the general public interest, supply
of essential goods or services - such as water supply, sewage service,
distributing medicines, of foodgrains (PDS entities), etc.
206.4.2. While carrying on of such activities to achieve such objects
(which are to be discerned from the objects and policy of the
enactment; or in terms of the controlling instrument, such as
memorandum of association, etc.), the purpose for which such public
GPU charity, is set up - whether for furthering the development or a
charitable object or for carrying on trade, business or commerce or
service in relation to such trade, etc.
206.4.3. Rendition of service or providing any article or goods, by
such boards, authority, corporation, etc. on cost or nominal markup
basis would ipso facto not be activities in the nature of business, trade
or commerce or service in relation to such business, trade or commerce.
206.4.4. Where the controlling instrument, particularly a statute
imposes certain responsibilities or duties upon the body concerned,
such as fixation of rates on predetermined statutory basis, or based on
formulae regulated by law, or rules having the force of law, setting
apart amenities for the purposes of development, charging fixed rates
towards supply of water, providing sewage services, providing
foodgrains, medicines, and/or retaining monies in deposits or
government securities and drawing interest therefrom or charging lease
rent, ground rent, etc. per se, recovery of such charges, fee, interest,
etc. cannot be characterised as "fee, cess or other consideration" for
engaging in activities in
the nature of trade, commerce, or business, or for providing service in
relation in relation thereto.
206.4.5. Does the statute or controlling instrument set out the
policy or scheme, for how the goods and services are to be distributed;
in what proportion the surpluses, or profits, can be permissively
garnered; are there are limits within which plots, rates or costs are to
be worked out; whether the function in which the body is engaged in, is
normally something a Government or State is expected to engage in,
having regard to provisions of the Constitution and the enacted laws,
and the observations of this Court in NDMC28, whether in case surplus
or gains accrue, the corporation, body or authority is permitted to
distribute it, and if so, only to the Government or State; the extent to
which the State or its instrumentalities have control over the
corporation or its bodies, and whether it is subject to directions by the
Government, etc. concerned.
206.4.6. As long as the statutory body, corporation, authority, etc.
concerned while actually furthering a GPU object, carries out activities
that entail some trade, commerce or business, which generates profit
(i.e. amounts that are significantly higher than the cost), and the
quantum of such receipts are within the prescribed limit [20% as
mandated by the second proviso to Section 2(15)] - the statutory or
government organisations concerned can be characterised as GPU
charities. It goes without saying that the other conditions imposed by
the seventh proviso to Section 10(23-C) and by Section 11 have to
necessarily be fulfilled.
206.5. As a consequence, it is necessary in each case, having regard
to the first proviso and seventeenth proviso (the latter introduced in
2012, w.r.e.f. 1-4-2009) to Section 10(23-C), that the authority
considering granting exemption, takes into account the objects of the
enactment or instrument concerned, its underlying policy, and the
nature of the functions, and activities, of the entity claiming to be a
GPU charity. If in the course of its functioning it collects fees, or any
consideration that merely cover its expenditure (including
administrative and other costs plus a small proportion for provision) -
such amounts are not consideration towards trade, commerce or
business, or service in relation thereto. However, amounts which are
significantly higher than recovery of costs, have to be treated as
receipts from trade, commerce or business. It is for those amounts,
that the quantitative limit in proviso (ii) to Section 2(15) applies, and
for which separate books of account will have to be maintained under
other provisions of the IT Act.
(ii) Statutory regulatory bodies/authorities
207. During the hearings, rival contentions were made in regard to
the facial nature of the public utility character of regulatory bodies. A
sample special case was that of the Institute of Chartered Accountants
of India ("ICAI"). In respect of some years, the Revenue has preferred
appeals and in respect of some others, the Institute has preferred
appeals. Reliance was placed upon the provisions
of the ICAI Act and detailed submissions were made to emphasise that
it plays a pivotal role in regulating the entire universe of vocation of
Chartered Accountants - i.e. selecting candidates that can undergo the
educational course, setting the syllabus for the Chartered Accountancy
examination; holding classes, training sessions and imparting
education; conducting exams, etc. It was highlighted that the
membership of the Institute i.e. those who are enrolled as Chartered
Accountants has grown significantly. Whereas in the end of Financial
Year 2005, the membership was 1.23 lakhs, it had increased to
1,86,440 on 31-3-2012. Likewise, there was an exponential growth in
the students appearing in the examination - in 2005, it was 2,96,294,
and on 31-3-2012, it had increased to 10,70,839. Apparently, the
Institute conducts distance education courses and also conducts
classroom instruction facilities. These are integrated with the course
curriculum. Additionally, it was urged that no commercial motive was
involved; coaching and revisional classes conducted are very nominally
priced - ranging from Rs 1500 to Rs 2500 for one group, and from Rs
4000 to Rs 6000 for both groups, depending on cities where the classes
are held.
208. During the submissions on behalf of the Institute, the
financials for different years were provided. It was revealed that the
total outflow towards salaries for 2003-04 was Rs 55.27 lakhs and
depreciation for the same was Rs 51.64 lakhs. The total expenditure for
that year was Rs 1.0691 lakhs. As against that, the revenue earned
from generation of fees for the corresponding year which was Rs 1.78
crores and the corresponding expenditure was Rs 96.93 lakhs. The
corresponding figures for FY 2011-12 for salaries was Rs 2.94 crores.
The depreciation was Rs 4.05 crores. The total expenditure thus was Rs
6.9 crores. As against this, the amount received towards fees was Rs
6.36 crores and expenditure incurred towards coaching, including
salaries, provisions of course material, etc. was Rs 4.34 crores. The
surplus (without including administrative expenditure) for that year
was Rs 2.01 crores. The Institute apparently cannot distribute the
surplus or utilise it for any activity other than what is set out under the
controlling statute and its rules.
209. The Revenue highlighted that conducting courses leading to a
professional qualification and charging fees for it is in the nature of a
"service", and all services in relation to trade, commerce or business
squarely falls within the mischief of Section 2(15), which has to
preclude the Institute's claim for exemption as a GPU charity.
210. The Institute is a creature of the Institute of Chartered
Accountants Act, 1949. By Section 4 of this Act, every person who
qualifies in the examination conducted by the Institute has to seek
registration as a Chartered Accountant. Only when members obtain
certificates issued by the Council of the Institute under Section 6 can
they be known as a "Chartered Accountant" and be entitled to practise
that profession (Sections 6 and 7). The Council of the Institute is
constituted under Section 9 which defines such constitution and the
manner for holding elections, etc. The functions of the Council by
Section 15(2-A) include approving the academic courses and their
contents, examining the candidates, regulation and articleship
assistance, prescribing
qualification for entry of persons in the register, collection of fees from
members; the regulation and maintenance and status of the
professional qualifications of the members of the Institute, etc. By
Section 15-A, universities are enabled to impart education on subjects
covered by the academic courses of the Institute. However, by Section
15-A(2) while awarding degrees or diplomas, their designation should
not resemble or be identical to what is awarded by the Institute. The
finances are regulated by Section 18. The Council is enjoined to
maintain the register under Section 19 and has disciplinary powers by
virtue of Sections 21-A, 21-B and 21- of the Act.
211. These provisions of the Act clarify beyond a doubt that the
Institute performs statutory functions in the larger public interest of
regulating the standards of education, leading up to the profession of
Chartered Accountancy and also prescribing standards of professional
etiquette, behaviour, and discipline of its members. No other entity or
body has the authority in law to perform the functions that the Institute
does. Although the Act regulating Chartered Accountancy came into
force prior to the Constitution of India, the subject (of regulating
professions, etc.) appears to be relatable to the exercise of legislative
power under Entries 25 and 26 of the Concurrent List153. Furthermore,
they also appear to conform to Entry 65 of the Union List154 (which has
been adverted to in Entry 25 of the Concurrent List). As things stand,
the Institute is the only body which prescribes the contents of
professional education and entirely regulates the profession of
Chartered Accountancy. There is no other body authorised to perform
any other duties which it performs. It, therefore, clearly falls in the
description of a charity advancing general public utility. Having regard
to the previous discussion on the nature of charities and what
constitutes activities in the "nature of trade, business or commerce",
the functions of the Institute ipso facto does not fall within the
description of such "prohibited activities". The fees charged by the
Institute and the manner of its utilisation are entirely controlled by law.
Furthermore, the material on record shows that the amounts received
by it are not towards providing any
commercial service or business but are essential for the providing of
service to the society and the general public.
212. Similarly, there are several other regulatory bodies that
discharge functions which are otherwise within the domain of the State.
A singular characteristic of ICAI and other statutory bodies which can
be said to regulate specific functions and professions (including the
profession of Cost and Work Accountants, and Company Secretary, etc.)
is the powers conferred upon them by the statutes to prescribe
standards and enforce them through disciplinary sanctions. Therefore, it
is held that bodies which regulate professions and are created by or
under statutes which are enjoined to prescribe compulsory courses to
be undergone before the individuals concerned is entitled to claim entry
into the profession or vocation, and also continuously monitor the
conduct of its members do not ipso facto carry on activities in the
nature of trade, commerce or business, or services in relation thereto.
213. At the same time, this Court would sound a note of caution. It
is important, at times, while considering the nature of activities (which
may be part of a statutory mandate) that regulatory bodies may
perform, whether the kind of consideration charged is vastly or
significantly higher than the costs it incurs. For instance, there can be
in given situations, regulatory fees which may have to be paid annually,
or the body may require candidates, or professionals to purchase and
fill forms, for entry into the profession, or towards examinations. If the
level of such fees or collection towards forms, brochures, or exams are
significantly higher than the cost, such income would attract the
mischief of proviso to Section 2(15), and would have to be within the
limits prescribed by sub-clause (ii) of the proviso to Section 2(15).
214. The next set of "statutory regulatory authorities" among the
present batch are those related to authorities set up under the Seeds
Act, 1966 (i.e. the Andhra Pradesh State Seeds Certification Authority
and the Rajasthan State Seeds and Organic Production Certification
Agency). These two entities are set up as societies under Section 8 of
the Seeds Act, and comprise of farmers, farmers cooperatives'
representatives, seed certification authorities, etc. The task of these
agencies and authorities is certification of seeds, to decide whether to
certify supply of seeds of "any notified kind or variety", by applicants
who may wish to offer them for trade. These agencies/authorities
scrutinise the samples to ensure they conform to the requisite standard
notified under Section 6. These decisions are subject to appeal under
Section 11.
215. The functioning of the Seed Certification Agency, is a crucial
one, in those only seeds conforming to prescribed standards, are
permitted to be traded and used, by farmers. Such standards are - in
the context of the fact that agriculture is one of the mainstays of the
economy, and furthermore, pivotal for food security - essential as they
ensure efficacy of seeds and guarantee to the farmers that they can be
relied upon. The essential nature of the regulatory function performed
by these certification agencies is obvious. The nature of their activities
is not by way of trade, commerce or business, nor service in relation to
trade, commerce, business, for some form of consideration.
(iii) Trade promotion bodies, councils, associations or
organisations
216. Surat Art Silk1 and other decisions, had ruled that as long as
the objects of trade promotion bodies were for general public utility
-
wherein "trade promotion" in itself, was held to be a GPU - the fact
that incidentally these bodies carried on some commercial activity,
leading to profit, did not preclude them from claiming to be driven by
charitable purpose. As observed earlier, the enunciation of those
principles were in the context of the unamended Section 2(15).
217. The question that arises is whether the change in definition
impacts the claims of trade promotion bodies, federations of commerce,
or such organisations, that they are GPU charities. The judgment in
Surat Art Silk1 proceeded on the assumption that trade promotion was
the predominant object of the GPU charity before the Court, and that
other objects - including procuring licences, trade, etc. were
p. 38, para 2)
"2. (b) To carry on all and any of the business of Art Silk Yarn,
Raw Silk, Cotton Yarn as well as Art Silk Cloth, Silk Cloth and Cotton
Cloth belonging to and on behalf of the members.
*
*
(e) To buy and sell and deal in all kinds of cloth and other goods
and fabrics belonging to and on behalf of the members."
This Court, nevertheless, held that since the predominant object of the
assessee was trade promotion, while furthering it, the fact that some
trading occurred, leading to income, did not preclude the assessee from
claiming tax exemption.
218. In the opinion of this Court, the change in definition in Section
2(15) and the negative phraseology - excluding from consideration,
trusts or institutions which provide services in relation to trade,
commerce or business, for fee or other consideration - has made a
difference. Organising meetings, disseminating information through
publications, holding awareness camps and events, would be broadly
covered by trade promotion. However, when a trade promotion body
provides individualised or specialised services - such as conducting
paid workshops, training courses, skill development courses certified by
it, and hires venues which are then let out to industrial, trading or
business organisations, to promote and advertise their respective
businesses, the claim for GPU status needs to be scrutinised more
closely. Such activities are in the nature of services "in relation to"
trade, commerce or business. These activities, and the facility of
consultation, or skill development courses, are meant to improve
business activities, and make them more efficient. The receipts from
such activities clearly are "fee or other consideration" for providing
service "in relation to" trade, commerce or business.
219. The Revenue has appealed to this Court, in respect of two
assessment years, in the case of Apparel Export Promotion Council
(AEPC). The objects of AEPC, which was set up in 1978 include
promotion of ready-made garment export. To achieve that end, its
objects include providing training to instil skills in the workforce, to
improve skills in the industry; guide in sourcing machinery; to serve as
a body advising, providing information on market or technical
intelligence; assisting the industry concerned in obtaining import
licences; showcase the best capabilities of Indian garment exports
through the prestigious "India International Garment Fair" organised
twice a year by AEPC, etc. These fairs host over 350 participants who
exhibit their garment designs and patterns. Other functions are to
provide information, and to provide market research. AEPC also assists
in developing new design patterns and garments and to perform
promotional activities in individual foreign markets. Further, AEPC
sends missions and trade delegations abroad, who participate in
international fairs; and conducts surveys to gather information on
potential export of ready-made garments.
220. As part of its functioning, it also books bulk space, which is
then rented out to individual Indian exporters, who showcase their
products and services, and ultimately secure export orders. Towards
these services i.e. booking and providing space, AEPC charges rentals.
Now, these rents are not towards fixed assets owned by it. They are in
fact charges, or fees, towards services in relation to business; likewise,
the skill development and diploma courses conducted by it, for which
fees are charged, are to improve business functioning of garment
exporters. Furthermore, market surveys and market intelligence,
especially country-specific activities, aimed at catering to specified
exporters, or specified class of exporters, is also service in relation to
trade, commerce or business.
221. In the circumstances, it cannot be said that AEPC's functioning
does not involve any element of trade, commerce or business, or
service in relation thereto. Though in some instances, the recipient may
be an individual business house or exporter, there is no doubt that
these activities, performed by a trade body continue to be trade
promotion. Therefore, they are in the "actual course of carrying on" the
GPU activity. In such a case, for each year, the question would be
whether the quantum from these receipts, and other such receipts are
within the limit prescribed by the sub-clause (ii) to proviso to Section 2
(15). If they are within the limits, AEPC would be - for that year,
entitled to claim benefit as a GPU charity.
(iv) Non-statutory bodies - ERNET, NIXI and GS1 India
222. ERNET is a not-for-profit society, set up under the aegis of the
Union Government. At one time, government functionaries, including
the late President, A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, were members, on account of
their ex officio capacity. The objects of this assessee are:
"3.1.1. To advance the cause of computer communication in the
country in all its aspects and dimensions with a view to provide rapid
nationwide development of the sector and technological and
economic growth of the county.
3.1.2. To develop, design, set up and operate nationwide state-of-
the-art computer communication infrastructure with international
connectivity directed towards research and development,
advancement of high quality education, create and host content,
express creative and academic potential via intranet and intranet
peer-to-peer connectivity among educational and research
institutions in the country and the world and make available the
communication infrastructure to users in academic, research and
development institutions, government organisations in line with
national priorities."
223. ERNET'S networks are a mix of terrestrial and satellite-based
wide-area network. It provides services through its 15 Points of
Presence (PoPs) located across the country. All those are equipped to
provide access to Intranet, Internet and Digital Library through trial
leased circuits and radio links to the user institutions. The PoP at STPI,
Bengaluru provides Intranet and Internet access through satellite.
ERNET provides services, namely, Network Access Services, Network
Applications Services, Hosting Services, Operations Support Services
and Domain Registration Services under srnet.in, ac.in, edu.in & res.in
domains. Funded through government grants, its projects support
educational networks and development of internet infrastructure in
numerous other segments of the society.
224. Having regard to the nature of ERNET'S activities, it cannot be
said that they are in the nature of trade, commerce or business, or
service, towards trade, commerce or business. It has to receive fees, to
reimburse its costs. The materials on record nowhere suggest that its
receipts (in the nature of membership fee, connectivity charges, data
transfer differential charges, and registration charges) are of such
nature as to be called as fees or consideration towards business, trade
or commerce, or service in relation to it. The functions ERNET performs
are vital to the development of online educational and research
platforms. For these reasons, it is held that the impugned judgment155 155 ,
which upheld the ITAT's order 156, , does not call for interference.
225. The Revenue has appealed the decision157 of the Delhi High
Court in which the National Internet Exchange of India ("NIXI") was
held to be a GPU category charity. The materials on record show that
NIXI was established in 2003 under the aegis of the Ministry of
Information Technology of the Union Government for the promotion and
growth of internet services in India, to regulate the internet traffic, act
as an internet exchange, and undertake ".in" domain name registration.
Concededly, NIXI, is a not for profit, and is barred from undertaking
any commercial or business activity. Its object is to promote the
interests of internet service providers and internet consumers in India,
improve quality of internet service, save foreign exchange, and carry on
domain name operations. It is bound by licensing conditions - which
include
the prohibition from altering its memorandum, without the prior
consent of the Union Government. According to the submissions made
on NIXI's behalf, it charges annual membership fee of Rs 1000 and
registration of second and third level domain names at Rs 500 and Rs
250. The finding of the ITAT and the High Court are that NIXI's objects
and functioning are by way of general public utility and thus it is a GPU
category charity.
226. Having regard to the findings on record and the materials
placed by the parties, it is evident that NIXI carries on the essential -
crucial purpose of promoting internet services and more importantly,
regulating domain name registration which is extremely essential for
internet users in India. A country's need to have a domestic internet
exchange, rather than depend on an international one, cannot be
overemphasised. The Union Government's object of setting up of
internet exchange is part of its essential function as a Government to
regulate certain segment of the communication networks. In the
absence of a single entity authorised to register ".in" domain names,
there is bound to be chaos or confusion.
227. In view of the foregoing discussion, this Court is of the opinion
that the Revenue's contention that NIXI does not merely carry on
public purpose of regulatory activity but is involved in trade, commerce,
or business or in providing service in relation thereto, cannot be
accepted.
228. The next assessee under consideration is GS1 India. GS1 codes
were developed and created by GS1 International, Belgium (an
international not-for-profit under Belgium tax law). This coding system
has been in use worldwide and is even mandatory for some
services/goods, or adopted for significant advantages being a singular
identification system, recognised and accepted all over the world. The
code promotes universal standard in Electronic Data Inter-exchanged
("EDI") and other services. This system of coding has been accorded
priority by the Government of India as it is a compulsory requirement
on products exported from India. The Government of India had set up
non-profit organisations EAN India, now known as GS1 India (the
assessee).
229. The counsel on behalf of GS1 India, submitted that GS1 is
affiliated and conferred exclusive rights relating to GS1 coding in India.
The GS1 code on a product, provides a unique identification to it with
wide-ranging benefits and advantages which facilitate tracking, tracing
of the product, product recalls, counterfeit detection, user safety due to
accuracy, wastage control through accurate monitoring and stock levels
for commodities, security and safety of supply chains, detection of
illegal trade, etc. The unique identification or coding system developed
and operated by GS1 International or GS1 India is recognised and
accepted globally. Additionally, the unique identification code can be
enabled with RFID chip and other electronic technology. Being one of
its kinds globally, only a GS1 registered organisation can set up and
promote the said system/standard within a country. These can be used
for several fields including public distribution system, agriculture,
health products, etc. and has been successfully used for product
package labels. The utility and benefits of a universal coding system
assessable by anyone across the globe, for the consumers,
Government, manufacturers, traders, exporters, etc. are enormous and
significant. Initial registration fee of Rs 20,000 is charged by GS1, plus
annual fee of Rs 4000 (enhanced to Rs 5000 from Financial Year 2006-
07 onwards) from third parties, who become subscribing members, and
are entitled to use the GS1 coding system.
230. It was submitted on behalf of GS1 that it was set up as society
in 1996 and sponsored by the Union Government. The Union
Government representatives and the representatives of the trade bodies
are its members. The activities of GS1 are extremely important and
have to be characterised as involving general public utility. It was
submitted that having regard to the fact that GS1 provides services to
all organisations regardless of whether they carry on business, trade or
other commercial activity, a narrow interpretation confining the
expression "service in relation to" should not be adopted. It was urged,
that there is no dispute about the fact that GS1 was directed to be
granted registration under the IT Act, and that GS1, Belgium, the
parent organisation, so to say, which owns the technology, has been
granted the status of not-for-profit charity. GS1 urges that it is not
dealing or treating the prized rights as a right be exploited
commercially to earn or generate profits. It is not directly or indirectly
subjecting their activity to market mechanism/dynamics (i.e. demand
and supply), rather it is motivated and prompted to serve the
beneficiaries. Therefore, this is not a case of commercial exploitation of
intellectual property rights to earn profits (as contended by the
Revenue), but rather a case where a token fee has been fixed and
payable by the user of the global identification system. Clause 44 of
GSI's memorandum of association of the petitioner stipulates that it is
a "not-for-profit" society and the funds/receipts are to only be used for
promotion of objects of the society for which it is established, including
sustenance and expansion.
231. The Revenue contended that although GS1 India has a
monopoly, the mere fact that it is stated to be a not-for-profit Society
with some governmental involvement in its management would not
detract from its essential nature; which is to subserve the interest of
the business community. It was elaborated in this context that GS1 by
providing bar codes and the coding system secured by licence, not only
exploits the intellectual property rights but is in fact engaged in
services in relation to trade, commerce or business. The counsel
pointed to the fact that the revenues of GS1 has steadily increased over
the years. It was pointed out that according to the balance sheet the
aggregate registration fees receipt for the year ending 31-3-2007 was
Rs 1,80,80,760 whereas for the year ending 31-3-2008 which had
increased to Rs 4,85,47,170. Likewise, membership fees had increased
from Rs 44,40,000 as on 31-3-2007 to Rs 93,42,500. Furthermore,
renewal fees for the year ending 2007 was Rs 1,68,57,200 whereas for
the next year i.e. as on 31-3-2008 it was Rs 1,90,50,650. The Revenue
submitted that even where income and interest were to be excluded,
the increase on a yearly basis was exponential. Likewise, it was pointed
out that registration fees as on 31-3-2011 was Rs 4,24,69,850 whereas
as on 31-3-2012 it was Rs 6,07,58,100; subscription fee as on 31-3-
2011 was Rs 1,02,06,720; for the next year i.e. on 31-3-2012 it
was Rs 1,01,69,850. Likewise, the subscription renewal fees as on 31-3
-2011 was Rs 4,18,62,804 and the same head as on 31-3-2012 was Rs
4,46,71,134.
232. The Revenue emphasises the fact that GS1 is a monopolist
organisation, has exclusive licences in relation to bar coding technology
which it admittedly uses for fee or other consideration. It is highlighted
that these services are provided mostly to business, trade purpose,
manufacturing, etc. On the other hand, GS1 urges that it performs the
important public function which enables not merely manufacturers but
others involved in supplies of various articles by packaging, etc. to
regulate and ensure their identity.
233. In the opinion of this Court, GS1's functions no doubt is of
general public utility. However, equally the services it performs are to
aid businesses manufactures, tradesmen and commercial
establishments. Bar coding packaged articles and goods assists their
consigners to identify them; helps manufactures, and marketing
organisations (especially in the context of contemporary times, online
platforms which serve as market places). The objective of GS1 is
therefore, to provide service in relation to business, trade or commerce
- for a fee or other consideration. It is also true, that the coding
system it possesses and the facilities it provides, is capable of and
perhaps is being used, by other sectors, in the welfare or public interest
fields. However, in the absence of any figures, showing the contribution
of GS1's revenues from those segments, and whether it charges lower
amounts, from such organisations, no inference can be drawn in that
regard. The materials on record show that the coding services are used
for commercial or business purposes. Having regard to these
circumstances, the Court is of the opinion that the impugned judgment
and order157a calls for interference.
(v) State Cricket Associations
234. The Revenue has preferred appeals against the decisionÂ¹ 158 of
the Gujarat High Court in respect of orders made in the cases of the
Gujarat Cricket Association, the Saurashtra Cricket Association, Baroda
and Rajkot Cricket Associations and the decision159 of the Rajasthan
High Court, in respect of the Rajasthan Cricket Association. The main
facts, relevant for deciding the questions involved are set out in the
order16 160 of the ITAT161 against which the Gujarat High Court rendered
the impugned judgment162. Since the legal issues are common in
relation to all these matters, the facts relating to the Gujarat Cricket
Association ("GCA") may be considered for convenience.
235. The objects of GCA (and other associations) are to control,
supervise, regulate, promote or encourage, and develop the game of
cricket in the area under its jurisdiction. The Association can also
undertake any other and all activities which may be beneficial to it.
GCA's objects include activities aimed at creating, fostering and
maintaining friendly and cordial relationship through sports
tournaments and competitions, to create a healthy spirit through the
medium of sports in general, and cricket in particular. The other objects
include : to instil the spirit of sportsmanship in school and college
students, members of other institutions, and other citizens; instil the
ideals of cricket and educate them in the same; to select teams to
represent the Association in any competitive forum; to arrange,
supervise, hold, encourage and finance visits of teams; to arrange or
manage league and/or any other tournaments; to promote persons,
meetings, competitions and matches in relation to sports; and to offer,
give/distribute or contribute towards prizes, medals and awards; to lay
out grounds for playing the game; and to provide pavilion, stadia, other
conveniences and amenities in connection therewith. The GCA also
includes within its objects, providing coaching to deserving persons in
the various departments of the game of cricket; engaging professional
cricketers, coaches, umpires, groundsmen, and other employees, and to
pay remuneration or honorarium to them; and to start, sponsor and/or
to subscribe to any fund for the benefit of such persons or their
families. The GCA can collect funds for the purpose of the Association
and utilise it in such manner as its Managing Committee considers
desirable for the fulfilment of its objects.
236. The assessing authorities denied GCA's claim and that of the
other associations, that they were charities. Before the ITAT, it was
contended, on behalf of the Revenue, inter alia, that looking at the
nature of the relationship of these State Cricket Associations with the
Board of Cricket Control of India ("BCCI"), the amounts received by
these associations from BCCI were in the nature of consideration or
fees, for granting media rights, and collecting their share, among other
things. This amounted to a business or commercial activity. It would, in
this context, be useful to quote the observations set out in the ITAT's
order160
(which were part of the Commissioner's order). The
Commissioner had taken note of assessment proceedings in relation to
OnLine ITAT para 12)
"12.
9.7.2. The AO of BCCI, based on the communication of DIT
(E), Mumbai, has not granted benefit of Sections 11 & 12 of the Act
to BCCI. The stand taken by BCCI during its assessment proceedings
is mentioned below. The BCCI vide its submission dated 3-12-2012
to the AO has explained its relationship with State Cricket
Association as follows:
'1. BCCI is society registered under the Tamil Nadu Societies
Registration Act. It was formed in the year 1929 with the object
of promotion and development of cricket in India and is a member
of the International Cricket Council ("ICC") the regulatory body
for world
cricket. As a member of ICC, BCCI represents India in bilateral tours
between member countries and in ICC tournaments such as the World
Cup.
2. BCCI has 30 members out of whom 25 are State Cricket
Associations, 2 are private clubs and 3 are Central Government
Institutions. BCCI does not own or manage the infrastructure and
facilities that are required for cricket. It encourages and oversees
the various State Associations to promote the game, build the
required infrastructure organise tournaments, leagues, coaching
camps, etc. in their respective States. Whenever a foreign team
visits India, the international matches such as Test and ODI are
allotted by BCCI to the State Cricket Associations by a rotation
policy. The matches are conducted and managed by the
respective State Associations and over time, arrangements have
evolved about the respective responsibilities, rights, shares of
revenue, etc. These have evolved in order to promote co-operation
and unity among the member associations and by applying the
principles of equity and fairness, for which the sport of cricket
is
renowned.'
9.7.3. The BCCI in its submission dated 21-1-2013 earned
subsidy paid to SCAs and TV Subvention as stated as follows:
'13.2. PAYMENTS TO STATE ASSOCIATIONS
During the year, BCCI has paid amounts to the State Associations
under the head "TV, Subventions to Associations". This represents
payment of 70% of the revenue from sale of media rights to the
State Associations."
Whenever a foreign team visits India, the international matches
such as Test and ODI are allotted by BCCI to the State Cricket
Associations by a rotation policy. The matches are conducted and
managed by the respective State Associations. It is not possible for
BCCI to conduct all these matches with its own limited personnel. It
is dependent on the State Associations, their office bearers, their
employees and their network and resources at the local centre to
conduct the matches.
The association manage the entire match right from provision of
security to players, spectators in coordination with respective State
police personnel, taking other security measures like fire prevention,
etc. The association incurs a good chunk of expenditure in
conducting an International Test/ODI/T20/IPL/CL T20 Matches.
In order to have fair and equitable sharing of the revenues,
arrangements have evolved over time, about the respective
responsibilities, rights, shares of revenue, etc. of BCCI and the State
Associations. The State Association is entitled to the ticket revenue
and ground sponsorship revenues. Expenses on account of security
for players and spectators, temporary stands, operation of
floodlights, scoreboards, management of crowd. Insurance for the
match, electricity charges, catering, etc. are met
by the State Associations. On the other hand expenditure on
transportation of players and other match officials, boarding and
lodging, expenses on food for players and officials, tour fee, match fee,
etc. are met by BCCI and revenues from sponsorship belong to BCCI.
In respect of revenues from sale of media rights, an arrangement has
evolved over time. Until 1991-92 the income from media rights was
meagre. With the growth in income from media rights, it became
necessary to optimise the arrangement for sale of media rights. For a
Test series or ODI series conducted in multiple centres and organised
by BCCI and multiple State Associations, it was found that if each State
Association were to negotiate the sale of rights to events in its centre,
its negotiating strength would be low. It was, therefore, agreed that
BCCI would negotiate the sale of media rights for the entire country to
optimise the income under this head. It was further decided that out of
the receipts from the sale of media rights 70% of the gross revenue
less production cost would belong to the State Associations. Every year,
BCCI has paid out exactly 70% of its receipts from media rights (less-
production cost) to the State Associations. This amount has been
utilised by the respective associations to build infrastructure and
promote cricket, making the game more popular, nurturing and
encouraging cricket talent, and leading to higher revenues from media
rights.
*
*
*
Even in the event that exemption under Section 11 is denied, the
payments to State Associations must be allowed as a deduction, as
expenditure laid out or expended wholly and exclusively for the
purpose of earning such income, it must be appreciated that in order
to earn revenues, BCCI was and continues to be highly dependent on
the State Associations. BCCI does not have the infrastructure and
the resources to conduct the matches by itself and is dependent on
the State Associations to conduct the matches. The income from
media rights is dependent on the efforts of the State Associations in
conducting the matches from which the media rights accrue. The
division of revenues and expenditure is a matter of arrangement
between the parties. Certain incomes such as sale of ticket revenues
belong to the State Associations, who meet the expenditure on the
matches such as security for players and spectators temporary
stands, operation of floodlights, scoreboards, management of crowd,
insurance for the match, electricity charges, catering, etc. Whereas
with regard to the income from sale of media rights, the
arrangement between BCCI and the State Associations has been that
70% of the revenue would belong to the State Associations. As
shown, this has been the arrangement between the parties for the
twenty years. The State Associations are entitled by virtue of
established practice to 70% of the media right fee. It is in
expectation of this revenue that the various State Associations take
an active part and cooperate in the conduct of the matches. This
payment is therefore made only with a view to earn the income from
media rights."
(emphasis in original)
237. The ITAT accepted the assessee's contentions, and held16
160
that
the associations were GPU charities : (Gujarat Cricket Assn. caseÂ¹60 ,
"35. Let us take a pause here and examine as to what are the
activities of the assessee cricket associations so as to be brought
within the ambit of trade, commerce or business. We have seen
objects of the association, which are reproduced earlier in our order,
and it is not even the case of the revenue that these objects have
anything to do with any trade, commerce or business; these objects
are simply to promote cricket. The trigger for invoking proviso to
Section 2(15), as Shri Soparkar rightly contends, has to an activity
of the assessee which is in the nature of trade, commerce or
business. However, the case of the Revenue Authorities hinges on
the allegation that the way and manner in which cricket matches are
being organised, particularly the IPL matches, the activity of
organising cricket matches is nothing but brute commerce.
Undoubtedly, it would appear that right from the time Kerry Packer
started his World Series Cricket in 1977, there has been no looking
back in commercialisation of cricket and the impact of this
commercialisation has not left Indian cricket intact. The Indian
Premier League and the rules of the game being governed by the
dictates of commercial considerations may seem to be one such
example of commercialisation of Indian cricket. The difficulty for the
case of the Revenue before us, however, is that these matches are
not being organised by the local cricket associations. We are told
that the matches are being organised by the Board of Cricket Control
of India, but then, if we are to accept this claim and invoke the
proviso to Section 2(15) for this reason, it will amount to a situation
in which proviso to Section 2(15) is being invoked on account of
activities of an entity other than the assessees-something which law
does not permit. We are not really concerned, at this stage, whether
the allegations about commercialisation of cricket by the BCCI are
correct or not, because that aspect of the matter would be relevant
only for the purpose of proviso to Section 2(15) being invoked in the
hands of the BCCI. We do not wish to deal with that aspect of the
matter or to make any observations which would prejudge the case
of the BCCI. Suffice it to say that the very foundation of Revenue's
case is devoid of legally sustainable basis for the short reason that
the commercialisation of cricket by the BCCI, even if that be so,
cannot be reason enough to invoke the proviso to Section 2(15). We
are alive of learned Commissioner (DR)'s suggestion that the cricket
associations cannot be seen on standalone basis as the BCCI is
nothing but an apex body of these cricket associations at a collective
level and whatever BCCI does is at the behest of or with the
connivance of the local cricket associations, and that it is not the
case that anyone can become a Member of the BCCI because only a
recognised cricket association can become a Member of the BCCI.
We are also alive to the learned Commissioner's argument that what
is being sought to be
protected by the charitable status of these associations is the share of
these cricket associations from the commercial profits earned by the
BCCI by organising the cricket matches. The problem, however, is that
the activities of the apex body, as we have explained earlier, cannot be
reason enough to trigger proviso to Section 2(15) in these cases.
Whether these cricket associations collectively constitute BCCI or not,
in the event of BCCI being involved in commercial activities, the
taxability of such commercial profits will arise in the hands of the BCCI
and not the end beneficiaries. Even in such a case the point of
taxability of these profits is the BCCI and not the cricket associations,
because, even going by learned Commissioner's arguments, these
receipts in the hands of the cricket associations is nothing but
appropriation of profits. What can be taxed is accrual of profits and not
appropriation of profits. In any event, distinction between the cricket
associations and the BCCI cannot be ignored for the purposes of tax
treatment. There is no dispute that the matches were organised by the
BCCI, and the assessee cannot thus be faulted for the commercial
considerations said to be inherent in planning the matches. As we make
these observations, and as we do not have the benefit of hearing the
perspective of the BCCI, we make it clear that these observations will
have no bearing on any adjudication in the hands of the BCCI. Suffice it
to say that so far as the cricket associations are concerned, the
allegations of the Revenue Authorities have no bearing on the denial of
the status of "charitable activities" in the hands of the cricket
associations before us-particularly as learned Commissioner has not
been able to point out a single object of the assessee cricket
associations which is in the nature of trade, commerce or business,
and, as it is not even in dispute that the objects being pursued by the
assessee cricket associations are "objects of general public utility"
under Section 2(15). All the objects of the assessee cricket
associations, as reproduced earlier in this order, unambiguously seek to
promote the cricket, and this object, as has been all along accepted by
the CBDT itself, an object of general public utility."
238. In granting relief, the ITAT was persuaded by the decision of
the Madras High Court, in T.N. Cricket Assn. V. Director of Income
"55. The assessee is a member of the Board of Control for Cricket
in India ("BCCI"), which in turn is a member of ICC (International
Cricket Council). BCCI allots test matches with visiting foreign team
and one day international matches to various member cricket
associations which organise the matches in their stadia. The
franchisees conduct matches in the stadia belonging to the State
Cricket Association. The State Association is entitled to all in-stadia
sponsorship advertisement and beverage revenue and it incurs
expenses for the conduct of the matches. BCCI earns revenue by
way of sponsorship and media rights as well as franchisee revenue
for IPL and it distributes 70%, of the revenue to the member cricket
association. Thus, the assessee is also the recipient of the revenue.
Thus, for invoking Section 12-AA read with Section 2(15) of the Act,
the Revenue has to show that the activities are not fitting with the
objects of the association and that the dominant activities are in the
nature of trade, commerce and business. We do not think that by the
volume of receipt one can draw the inference that the activity is
commercial. The Income Tax Appellate Tribunal's view that it is an
entertainment and, hence, offended Section 2(15) of the Act does not
appear to be correct and the same is based on its own impression on
free ticket, payment of entertainment tax and presence of cheer group
and given the irrelevant consideration. These considerations are not
germane in considering the question as to whether the activities are
genuine or carried on in accordance with the objects of the association.
We can only say that the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal rested its
decision on consideration which are not relevant for considering the test
specified under Section 12-AA(3) to impose commercial character to
the activity of the association. In the circumstances, we agree with the
assessee that the Revenue has not made out any ground to cancel the
registration under Section 12-AA(3) of the Act. As regards the
observation of the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal that IPL matches and
Celebrity cricket matches are also being held by the association and
hence, it is an entertainment industry, we need not go into these
aspects for the order of the Director of Income Tax (Exemptions) casts
no doubt on the genuineness of the objects of the trust. Hence, it is for
the Assessing Officer to take note of all facts, while considering the
same under Section 11 of the Income Tax Act, 1961. We disapprove
the approach of the Tribunal in this regard. In the abovesaid
circumstances, we set aside the order of the Income Tax Appellate
Tribunal."
239. The ITAT agreed with the assessees that TV subsidy amounts
received by the associations were "corpus donations" in furtherance of
the BCCI's Resolution dated 5-9-2001. It accordingly held that these
amounts were in the capital field, irrespective of whether they were
fully utilised by the State Association, or whether some part of it, was
given to District Associations. Thus, for Assessment Year 2009-2010,
the sum of Rs 3,52,86,521 paid by BCCI to GCA was subsidy, falling in
the capital field.
240. It was urged on behalf of the Revenue that the Cricket
Associations are not carrying on any charitable activity; reliance was
placed on the facts to say that substantial amounts were received by
the State Associations, towards their share of sale of media rights (as
constituents or members of BCCI), which are commercial receipts.
Although the sale of those rights was by the BCCI, the lion's share of
those amounts was that of the respective State Associations.
Furthermore, the State Associations owned the stadia, and actually
conducted the matches, in respect of which stadium advertisements
and sponsorship amounts were received : these, too, were in the nature
of business or commercial activities. The assessees on the other hand,
submitted that they are distinct
from the BCCI. It was sought to be urged that the activity of sports and
sport promotion is basically education, and hence, per se exempt.
Realising the value of inculcating sportsmanship and fostering the
culture of sport, Parliament had introduced Section 10(23), to exempt
income received by sports bodies. However, that was deleted w.e.f. 1-4
-2003. It was argued that this does not preclude sports bodies, like
Cricket Associations from claiming to be charities. It was urged that
even if the Court were not to consider the Cricket Associations to be
education-related charities, they cannot be denied the status of GPU
charities, having regard to the sports promotional nature of their
objects. It was submitted that these bodies are primarily responsible
for fostering the sport, talent spotting, nurturing it, and providing
opportunities to those who have the aptitude and passion for the game
of cricket. All these are objects of general public utility. It was
submitted that the amounts which BCCI collects may or may not be in
the course of commerce; however, what is given to the associations is
subsidy, which cannot be termed as consideration for carrying on any
commercial activity.
241. At the outset, the contention that sports promotion is
"education" and hence, per se exempt, has to be dealt with. In Lok
Shikshana Trust14 this Court has comprehensively addressed the scope
of the term, and conclude that it would entail "scholastic" education :
"5. The sense in which the word "education" has been used in
Section 2(15) is the systematic instruction, schooling or training
given to the young in preparation for the work of life. It also
connotes the whole course of scholastic instruction which a person
has received. The word "education" has not been used in that wide
and extended sense, according to which every acquisition of further
knowledge constitutes education. According to this wide and
extended sense, travelling is education, because as a result of
travelling you acquire fresh knowledge. Likewise, if you read
newspapers and magazines, see pictures, visit art galleries,
museums and zoos, you thereby add to your knowledge. Again,
when you grow up and have dealings with other people, some of
whom are not straight, you learn by experience and thus add to your
knowledge of the ways of the world. If you are not careful, your
wallet is liable to be stolen or you are liable to be cheated by some
unscrupulous person. The thief who removes your wallet and the
swindler who cheats you teach you a lesson and in the process make
you wiser though poorer. If you visit a nightclub, you get acquainted
with and add to your knowledge about some of the not much
revealed realities and mysteries of life. All this in a way is education
in the great school of life. But that is not the sense in which the word
"education" is used in clause (15) of Section 2. What education
connotes in that clause is the process of training and developing the
knowledge, skill, mind and character of students by formal
schooling."
Therefore, there is no doubt that the claim of the present Sport
Associations will not fall within "education" and will have to be
examined under the fourth limb of Section 2(15) - i.e. GPU category, if
it is to make a case for tax exemption.
242. BCCI is the body which regulates cricket and represents the
country. Within the country it organises and conducts the Ranji Trophy,
the Irani Trophy, the Duleep Singh Trophy, the Deodar Trophy and the
NKP Salve Challenge Trophy. These are domestic events, yet only those
who are members of the Board and/or recognised by it can take part in
these events. The members of the Board (entitled to vote in its
164
election) are the State Cricket Associations. The BCCI is the country-
level cricket regulator both off and on the fields, and its functions
include selection of players and umpires. The International Cricket
Council (of which BCCI, as the representative body of the country, is a
member) possesses and exercises all the powers to regulate
international competitive cricket. It also exercises disciplinary power -
in case of violation of the rules, a country member or the player may be
derecognised. The ICC exercises a monopoly over the sports at the
international level whereas BCCI does so at the country level. BCCI
recognises bodies which are entitled to participate in the nominated
tournaments. Players and umpires also are to be registered with it.
243. The game of competitive cricket, at the organisational level is
structured in such a manner that BCCI has umbilical ties with the State
Associations. Not only are the latter, the members who constitute BCCI
and elect its governing bodies, they also own vital infrastructure
necessary to play cricket : such as stadia, and all related facilities. BCCI
does not own those facilities or infrastructure and depends on them.
Furthermore, the State Associations are the channels through which
players are mostly selected, and get opportunities to participate in
State, national and international level cricket.
244. As things stand, therefore, the State Associations and BCCI are
linked closely. The management of the game of cricket is structured in
such a way that this link is apparent at every match or fixture of
significance. In the course of conducting matches (which are scheduled
by the BCCI as the national coordinating body), apart from amounts
received towards sale of entry tickets, the State Associations also
receive advertisement money, sponsorship fee, etc. from the BCCI.
Aside from these, media rights - i.e. broadcasting rights to each
national or international event conducted at various locales owned by
the State Associations, and digital rights (all of which are exclusive, in
nature) - are auctioned by BCCI. As noticed above, the BCCI, by its
own admission, negotiates the terms on which media rights are sold, on
behalf of the State Associations:
"For a Test series or ODI series conducted in multiple centres and
organised by BCCI and multiple State Associations, it was found that
if each State Association were to negotiate the sale of rights to
events in its centre, its negotiating strength would be low. It was,
therefore, agreed that BCCI would negotiate the sale of media rights
for the entire country to optimise the income under this head. It was
further decided that out
of the receipts from the sale of media rights 70% of the gross revenue
less production cost would belong to the State Associations. Every year,
BCCI has paid out exactly 70% of its receipts from media rights (less -
production cost) to the State Associations. This amount has been
utilised by the respective associations to build infrastructure and
promote cricket, making the game more popular, nurturing and
encouraging cricket talent, and leading to higher revenues from media
rights."
245. These media, or broadcasting rights, are in the nature of
intellectual property rights : under Sections 37 to 40 of the Copyrights
Act, 1957. These rights-especially television and digital rights enable
the licensee or the successful bidder to exploit the telecast or broadcast
commercially, by carrying advertisements of various products and
services, in the media. Given that (i) BCCI does not own the stadia,
and uses the entire physical infrastructure of the State Associations, (ii)
expressly negotiates on their behalf for the sale of such rights (which
appear to be purely commercial contracts), the Associations' assertions
that they only received subsidy from BCCI, needed closer examination.
246. The income and expenditure account for the year ending on 31-
3-2009 shows that the total income of the GCA was Rs 4,03,98,736.81.
Of these sponsorship money was Rs 20,00,000; bank interest was Rs
2,21,88,527.05 and as against the head "India V. South Africa Test
Match", the sum of Rs 1,51,97,741 has been shown. Of the total of Rs
2,21,02,441.45 shown as income, Rs 32,24,591.25 is shown as
expenditure, only a fraction appears to have been expended towards
promotion of cricket. This is apparent from the following:

247. The details of the subsidy amounts received from BCCI for
every match has been shown. This aggregates to over Rs 41 lakhs.
Furthermore, the details received towards the India-South Africa test
fixture paid between 3-4-2008 to 4-4-2008 has been shown. GCA
received Rs 1,57,00,000 towards sale of space; ticket sales yielded Rs
27,57,700 and towards the head screen income, a sum of Rs 3 lakhs
was received. After deducting the expenditure, the excess income
received for the year was Rs 1,51,97,741.
248. In the case of Saurashtra Cricket Association, for the year
ended on 31-3-2012, various heads of income have been disclosed.
These include entry fees which is Rs 5200 onwards. Interest of income
received from fixed deposits was to the tune of Rs 8,85,67,418; total
amount of subsidy received from BCCI is Rs 17,56,72,490. Of these,
the overwhelming share is towards the IPL money collected by the
BCCI - wherein Saurashtra Cricket Association's share worked out to a
total of Rs 17,16,32,490.
249. Apart from this, the BCCI also reimbursed to Saurashtra
Cricket Association the sum of Rs 73,73,911. The income and
expenditure account shows a head titled "subvention income from
BCCI" to the extent of Rs 8,14,53,834. After deducting the heads of
expenditure, excess of income over expenditure for the assessment
year was Rs 69,96,537. The Cricket Association showed in the
expenditure column that the sum of Rs 24,00,00,000 was transferred to
the Cricket Infrastructure Fund. For the previous year, a sum of Rs
21,21,00,000 was transferred to the stadium fund.
250. It is quite evident that the activities of the Cricket Associations
are run on business lines. The associations own physical and other
infrastructure, maintain them, have arrangements for permanent
manpower and have well-organised supply chains to cater to the
several matches they host. Many such matches are not at national level
and are Under-16 or Under-18 matches at the regional level. However,
these activities are not to be seen in isolation but are to be regarded as
part of the overall scheme, and ecosystem in which the game of cricket
is organised in India. Talent is spotted, at local levels and dependent on
the promise shown, given appropriate exposure.
251. On a close scrutiny of the expenses borne, having regard to the
nature of receipts, the expenditure incurred by the Cricket Associations
does not disclose that any significant proportion is expended towards
sustained or organised coaching camps or academies. Therefore, in the
opinion of this Court, the ITAT fell into error in not considering the
nature of receipts flowing from the BCCI into the corpus of GCA and
SCA - as well as other associations that are before this Court - to
determine their true character. The ITAT appears to have been swayed
by the submission that the amount given by the BCCI were towards
capital subsidy.
252. To determine whether a given receipt is to be characterised as
falling in the revenue or capital stream, the objective for which it is
given as well as the manner in which it is utilised has to be scrutinised.
This aspect has been highlighted in Sahney Steel & Press Works Ltd. V.
"18.
It is not the source from which the amount is paid to the
assessee which is determinative of the question whether the subsidy
payments are of revenue or capital nature. The first proposition
stated by Viscount Simon in Ostime case166 is that if payments in
the nature of
subsidy from public funds are made to the assessee to assist him in
carrying on his trade or business, they are trade receipts."
This has later been followed in CIT V. Ponni Sugars & Chemicals Ltd. 167
253. Recent trends have shown that media rights, especially
broadcasting and digital media rights have yielded colossal revenues to
the BCCI. The model adopted in the last 10 years or so has been to
auction media rights in respect of events over a 3 or 5-year period. As
discussed previously, these media rights are not per se owned by BCCI,
which is but an association of persons or agglomerate of all the State
Cricket Association. The stadia which form the venue for these cricket
matches (in relation to which media rights are transferred or licensed)
are owned by the State Cricket Associations. According to the BCCI
itself, the State Associations can well bargain and enter into
arrangements for the sale of such media rights. However, to obtain
better terms, and gain bargaining leverage a centralised form of sale of
such rights has been agreed and adopted by which the BCCI auctions
these rights on behalf of the State Associations. All State Associations
put together are entitled to 70% of the Revenue - i.e. the proceeds of
sale of the media rights. This may or may not be in proportion to the
events hosted by each or some of the Cricket Associations. Yet, this
forms part of the arrangement by which the consideration flowing from
such commercial rights has been agreed to be shared amongst all
members of the BCCI. These rights are apparently commercial.
254. In the light of these, the Court is of the opinion that the ITAT
- as well as the High Court fell into error in accepting at face value the
submission that the amounts made over by BCCI to the Cricket
Associations were in the nature of infrastructure subsidy. In each case,
and for every year, the Tax Authorities are under an obligation to
carefully examine and see the pattern of receipts and expenditure.
Whilst doing so, the nature of rights conveyed by the BCCI to the
successful bidders, in other words, the content of broadcast rights as
well as the arrangement with respect to State Associations (either in
the form of master documents, resolutions or individual agreements
with State Associations) have to be examined. It goes without saying
that there need not be an exact correlation or a proportionate division
between the receipt and the actual expenditure. This is in line with the
principle that what is an adequate consideration for something which is
agreed upon by parties is a matter best left to them. These
observations are not however, to be treated as final; the parties'
contentions in this regard are to be considered on their merit.
(vi) Private trusts
(a) Tribune Trust
255. The Tribune Trust was constituted pursuant to a will executed
by late Sardar Dial Singh Majithia. In Clause (xxi) of his will - after
nominating three trustees, the testator directed that they ought to
maintain a press and a newspaper; in Clause (xx) the testator directed
that his property in the Tribune
Press and newspaper would vest permanently in a Committee of
Trustees who would thereafter maintain them and "keep up the liberal
policy of the newspaper and activity and the excess income after
current expenses in improving the said newspaper and place it on a
footing of permanency".
256. Under the old Act, a question arose as to whether the activity
of running a newspaper was one of general public utility; the Revenue
disallowed the exemption for Assessment Year 1932-33. This was
affirmed101 by the Lahore High Court. The Privy Council by its decision
in Trustees of Tribune, In re5 allowed the Trust's appeal and held that
the Trust was neither constituted for private profit either to the testator
nor to any other private person, and that the object of the paper could
be described as one "supplying the province with an organ of educated
public opinion". The Privy Council, therefore, reasoned that the Trust
was established as a GPU charity.
257. Apparently, the Trust was continuously treated as a GPU
category charity and exempted under Section 10(23-C)(iv) from 1984-
85 onwards. For Assessment Year 2009-10, after considering the
revised return of the Trust, the Revenue was of the opinion that it was
not entitled to claim exemption under Section 10(23-C). The Punjab
and Haryana High Court which dealt with the Trust's present appeal
was of the opinion that in Surat Art Silk1, this Court had considered the
judgment of the Privy Council. In that judgment, this Court had made
some observations that even though the activity of the publication of
newspaper was carried on commercial lines with the object of earning
profit, it was an activity engaged by the Trust for the purposes of
carrying out its charitable objects. The High Court upheld the Revenue's
contention and based upon its analysis of Section 2(15) concluded that
the Trust's income derived from its activities were based on profit
motive. In doing so, it was noticed that 85% of the Trust's revenue was
from advertisements and interest. The total revenue was Rs 161 crores
out of which Rs 124.87 crores was received from advertisements and Rs
11.38 crores from interest on FDRs; Rs 17.49 crores was from sale of
newspapers and Rs 3.74 crores from subscriptions of the dailies.
258. It was argued on behalf of the Trust that it was never intended
and in fact, not run on profitable basis. No part of its income was ever
disbursed to any private individual through profit sharing or otherwise,
nor distributed for any purpose other than the activities of the Trust. It
was submitted that the High Court's surmise that the accumulation of
large profits and its assumption that the Trust could utilise them for
non-charitable purposes in future, was unfounded. In this regard, it
was submitted that till 2008-2009 all assessments were completed,
since the Revenue was satisfied that more than 85% had been
ploughed back to feed the main charitable activity.
259. It is noticed from the impugned judgment 102 that the High
Court concedes to the fact that the Trust's activities were held by the
Privy Council to constitute financing of objects of "general public
utility"; further that merely because thousands of newspapers were
being published made no difference. It still continues to be a GPU
charity.
260. The question then is whether the nature of receipts and income
garnered by the Trust, in the course of actually carrying out its activity
of publishing newspaper, can be characterised as "in the nature of
trade, commerce or business" or "service in relation to trade, commerce
or business", for any consideration. During the course of submissions, it
was urged that advertisement revenue should not be treated as
business or commercial receipts since that virtually is the lifeblood
which sustains the activity of publication of newspapers. It was
highlighted that the object of maintaining the activity of publishing and
distribution of newspaper remains the advancement of general public
utility, as it has the effect of both notifying and educating the general
public about the current affairs and developments. The inclusion of
advertisements also serves as information to the general public,
especially in areas of employment, availability of resources, etc.
Therefore, publication of advertisement is intrinsically connected with
the activity of printing and publishing of newspapers.
261. The publication of advertisements for consideration, in the
opinion of the Court, by the newspaper, cannot but be termed as an
activity in the nature of carrying on business, trade or commerce for a
fee or consideration. That the newspaper published by the Trust ("The
Tribune") in this case is funded mainly through advertisement is no
basis for holding that publishing such advertisements by the Trust does
not constitute business. The object of the Trust to involve or engage in
publication of newspapers. Publishing advertisements is obviously to
garner receipts which are in the nature of profit. Now, by virtue of the
amended definition of Section 2(15), GPU charities can engage
themselves in business or commercial activity for profit, only if the
receipts from such activities do not exceed the quantitative limit of the
overall receipts earned in a given year. While the assessee's contention
that publication of advertisement is intrinsically linked with newspaper
activity [thereby fulfilling sub-clause (i) of the proviso to Section 2(15)
i.e. an activity in the course of actual carrying on of the activity towards
advancement of the object] is acceptable, nevertheless, the condition
imposed by sub-clause (ii) of the proviso to Section 2(15) has to also
be fulfilled. In the present case, that percentage had been exceeded, as
evident from the record.
262. In the light of the foregoing discussion, this Court is of the
opinion that the impugned judgment102 and order of the Punjab and
Haryana High Court cannot be sustained, to the extent it holds that The
Tribune Trust is not a GPU charity. However, having regard to the
factual analysis, the judgment needs no interference.
(b) Shri Balaji Samaj Vikas Samiti
2 The Revenue appeals a decision of the Allahabad High Court168
affirming the order169 of the ITAT which had directed the CIT to grant
registration under Section 12-AA of the Income Tax Act.
264. The assessee is a registered society which was formed with the
object of establishing and running a health club, Arogya Kendra; its
object included organisation of emergency relief centres, etc. Other
objects, included promotion of moral values, eradication of child labour,
dowry, etc. The assessee had entered into arrangements with the State
agencies to supply mid-day meals to students of primary schools in
different villages through contracts entered into with the Basic Shiksha
Adhikari, District Meerut. It is a matter of record that the materials for
preparation of mid-day meal was supplied by the Government. The
assessee Society claimed that it only obtains nominal charges for
preparation of mid-day meals. The assessee's claim for registration was
rejected on the ground that it was involved in commercial activity.
Upon appeal, the ITAT agreed with the assessee that supply of mid-day
meals did not constitute business or commerce and that it promoted
the objects of general public utility.
265. The Revenue in its appeal contends that the assessee's only
activity for the relevant year was supply of mid-day meals to primary
schools. This was not relatable to any object of the Society. The
assessee's contention is that the State ordinarily would have carried on
the activity of supply of mid-day meals. Yet, nevertheless it outsourced
its activity to an outside agency like the assessee which performed it
for nominal charges.
266. This Court is of the opinion that there is no clarity with respect
to whether the activity of supplying mid-day meals falls within the
objects clause of the assessee Society. The order of the ITAT as well as
the High Court disclosed that the assessee's objects involved
maintenance of health clubs, Arogya Kendra, promotion of moral values
and provision of emergency relief. These do not however include the
activity which it actually performed i.e. entering into contracts for
supply of mid-day meals and the activity of cooking and supply of mid-
day meals. In the absence of fuller material, it would not be possible for
the Court to assess the activity with which the assessee was engaged,
and determine whether it could be said to legitimately fall within the
description of GPU.
267. The first consideration would be whether the activity concerned
was or is in any manner covered by the objects clause. Secondly, the
Revenue Authorities should also consider the express terms of the
contract or contracts entered into by the assessee with the State or its
agencies. If on the basis of such contracts, the accounts disclose that
the amounts paid are nominal markup over and above the cost incurred
towards supplying the services, the activity may fall within the
description of one advancing the general public utility. If on the other
hand, there is a significant markup over the actual cost of service, the
next step would be to ascertain whether the quantitative limit in the
proviso to Section 2(15) is adhered to. It is only in the event of the
trust actually carrying on an activity in the course of achieving one of
its objects, and earning income which should not exceed the
quantitative limit prescribed at the relevant time, that it can be said to
be driven by charitable purpose.
268. This Court, in the normal circumstances, having regard to the
above discussion, would have remitted the matter for consideration.
However, it is apparent from the records that the tax effect is less than
Rs 10 lakhs. It is apparent that the receipt from the activities in the
present case did not exceed the quantitative limit of Rs 10 lakhs
prescribed at the relevant time. In the circumstances, the impugned
order of the High Court does not call for interference.
IV. Summation of conclusions
269. In view of the foregoing discussion and analysis, the following
conclusions are recorded regarding the interpretation of the changed
definition of "charitable purpose" (w.e.f. 1-4-2009), as well as the later
amendments, and other related provisions of the IT Act.
A. General test under Section 2(15)
270. It is clarified that an assessee advancing general public utility
cannot engage itself in any trade, commerce or business, or provide
service in relation thereto for any consideration ("cess, or fee, or any
other consideration").
271. However, in the course of achieving the object of general public
utility, the trust, society, or other such organisation concerned, can
carry on trade, commerce or business or provide services in relation
thereto for consideration, provided that (i) the activities of trade,
commerce or business are connected ("actual carrying out " inserted
w.e.f. 1-4-2016) to the achievement of its objects of GPU; and (ii) the
receipt from such business or commercial activity or service in relation
thereto, does not exceed the quantified limit, as amended over the
years (Rs 10 lakhs w.e.f. 1-4-2009; then Rs 25 lakhs w.e.f. 1-4-2012;
and now 20% of total receipts of the previous year, w.e.f. 1-4-2016).
272. Generally, the charging of any amount towards consideration
for such an activity (advancing general public utility), which is on cost-
basis or nominally above cost, cannot be considered to be "trade,
commerce, or business" or any services in relation thereto. It is only
when the charges are markedly or significantly above the cost incurred
by the assessee in question, that they would fall within the mischief of
"cess, or fee, or any other consideration" towards "trade, commerce or
business". In this regard, the Court has clarified through illustrations
what kind of services or goods provided on cost or nominal basis would
normally be excluded from the mischief of trade, commerce, or
business, in the body of the judgment.
273. Section 11(4-A) must be interpreted harmoniously with Section
2(15), with which there is no conflict. Carrying out activity in the
nature of trade, commerce or business, or service in relation to such
activities, should be conducted in the course of achieving the GPU
object, and the income, profit or surplus or gains must, therefore, be
incidental. The requirement in
Section 11(4-A) of maintaining separate books of account is also in line
with the necessity of demonstrating that the quantitative limit
prescribed in the proviso to Section 2(15), has not been breached.
Similarly, the insertion of Section 13(8), seventeenth proviso to Section
10(23-C) and third proviso to Section 143(3) (all w.r.e.f. 1-4-2009),
reaffirm this interpretation and bring uniformity across the statutory
provisions.
B. Authorities, corporations, or bodies established by statute
274. The amounts or any money whatsoever charged by a statutory
corporation, board or any other body set up by the State Governments
or
Central Government, for achieving what are essentially "public
functions/services" (such as housing, industrial development, supply of
water, sewage management, supply of foodgrain, development and
town planning, etc.) may resemble trade, commercial, or business
activities. However, since their objects are essential for advancement of
public purposes/functions (and are accordingly restrained by way of
statutory provisions), such receipts are prima facie to be excluded from
the mischief of business or commercial receipts. This is in line with the
larger Bench judgments of this Court in Shri Ramtanu Coop. Housing
Society33 and NDMC28
275. However, at the same time, in every case, the assessing
authorities would have to apply their minds and scrutinise the records,
to determine if, and to what extent, the consideration or amounts
charged are significantly higher than the cost and a nominal markup. If
such is the case, then the receipts would indicate that the activities are
in fact in the nature of "trade, commerce or business" and as a result,
would have to comply with the quantified limit (as amended from time
to time) in the proviso to Section 2(15) of the IT Act.
276. In clause (b) of Section 10(46) of the IT Act, "commercial" has
the same meaning as "trade, commerce, business" in Section 2(15) of
the IT Act. Therefore, sums charged by such notified body, authority,
board, trust or commission (by whatever name called) will require
similar consideration - i.e. whether it is at cost with a nominal markup
or significantly higher, to determine if it falls within the mischief of
"commercial activity". However, in the case of such notified bodies,
there is no quantified limit in Section 10(46). Therefore, the Central
Government would have to decide on a case-by-case basis whether and
to what extent, exemption can be awarded to bodies that are notified
under Section 10(46).
277. For the period 1-4-2003 to 1-4-2011, a statutory corporation
could claim the benefit of Section 2(15) having regard to the judgment
of this Court in the Gujarat Maritime Board case58. Likewise, the denial
of benefit under Section 10(46) after 1-4-2011 does not preclude a
statutory corporation, board, or whatever such body may be called,
from claiming that it is set up for a charitable purpose and seeking
exemption under Section 10(23-C) or other provisions of the Act.
C. Statutory regulators
278. The income and receipts of statutory regulatory bodies which
are for instance, tasked with exclusive duties of prescribing curriculum,
disciplining professionals and prescribing standards of professional
conduct, are prima facie not business or commercial receipts. However,
this is subject to the caveat that if the assessing authorities discern
that certain kinds of activities carried out by such regulatory body
involved charging of fees that are significantly higher than the cost
incurred (with a nominal markup) or providing other facilities or
services such as admission forms, coaching classes, registration
processing fees, etc. at markedly higher prices, those would constitute
commercial or business receipts. In that event, the overall quantitative
limit prescribed in the proviso to Section 2(15) (as amended from time
to time) has to be complied with, if the regulatory body is to be
considered as one with "charitable purpose" eligible for exemption
under the IT Act.
279. Like statutory authorities which regulate professions, statutory
bodies which certify products (such as seeds) based on standards for
qualification, etc. will also be treated similarly.
D. Trade promotion bodies
280. Bodies involved in trade promotion (such as AEPC), or set up
with the objects of purely advocating for, coordinating and assisting
trading organisations, can be said to be involved in advancement of
objects of general public utility. However, if such organisations provide
additional services such as courses meant to skill personnel, providing
private rental spaces in fairs or trade shows, consulting services, etc.
then income or receipts from such activities, would be business or
commercial in nature. In that event, the claim for tax exemption would
have to be again subjected to the rigours of the proviso to Section 2
(15) of the IT Act.
E. Non-statutory bodies
281. In the present batch of cases, non-statutory bodies performing
public functions, such as ERNET and NIXI are engaged in important
public purposes. The materials on record show that fees or
consideration charged by them for the purposes provided are nominal.
In the circumstances, it is held that the said two assessees are driven
by charitable purposes. However, the claims of such non-statutory
organisations performing public functions, will have to be ascertained
on a yearly basis, and the Tax Authorities must discern from the
records, whether the fees charged are nominally above the cost, or
have been increased to much higher levels.
282. It is held that though GS1 India is in fact, involved in
advancement of general public utility, its services are for the benefit of
trade and business, from which they receive significantly high receipts.
In the circumstances, its claim for exemption cannot succeed having
regard to amended Section 2(15). However, the Court does not rule out
any future claim made and being independently assessed, if GS1 is
able to satisfy that what it provides to its customers is charged on cost-
basis with at the most, a nominal markup.
F. Sports Associations
283. So far as the State Cricket Associations are concerned
(Saurashtra, Gujarat, Rajasthan, Baroda, and Rajkot), this Court is of
the opinion that the matter requires further scrutiny, in light of the
discussion in paras 244-254 of the judgment. Accordingly, a direction is
issued that the AO shall adjudicate the matter afresh after issuing
notice to the assessees concerned and examining the relevant material
indicated in the previous paragraphs of this judgment. Furthermore, if
any consequential order needs to be issued, the same shall be done
and resulting actions, including assessment orders shall be passed in
accordance with the law under relevant provisions of the IT Act.
G. Private trusts
284. So far as the appeal by assessee Tribune Trust is concerned, it
has been held that despite advancing general public utility, the Trust
cannot benefit from exemption offered to entities covered by Section 2
(15) as the records reveal that income received from advertisements,
constituted business or commercial receipts. Consequently, the limit
prescribed in the proviso to Section 2(15) has to be adhered to for the
Trust's claim of being as a charity eligible for exemption, to succeed.
Therefore, despite differing reasoning, this Court has held that the
impugned judgment102 of the High Court does not call for interference.
H. Application of interpretation
285. At the cost of repetition, it may be noted that the conclusions
arrived at by way of this judgment, neither precludes any of the
assessees (whether statutory, or non-statutory) advancing objects of
general public utility, from claiming exemption, nor the Taxing
Authorities from denying exemption, in the future, if the receipts of the
relevant year exceed the quantitative limit. The assessing authorities
must on a yearly basis, scrutinise the record to discern whether the
nature of the assessee's activities amount to "trade, commerce or
business" based on its receipts and income (i.e. whether the amounts
charged are on cost-basis, or significantly higher). If it is found that
they are in the nature of "trade, commerce or business", then it must
be examined whether the quantified limit (as amended from time to
time) in the proviso to Section 2(15), has been breached, thus
disentitling them to exemption.
286. In accordance with the foregoing discussion, and summary of
conclusions, the numerous appeals are disposed of as follows:
286.1. The Revenue's appeals against the Improvement Trust,
Moga 170, , the Hoshiarpur Improvement Trust171, Bathinda Improvement

"2. (15) "charitable purpose" includes relief of the poor, education, medical relief,
preservation of environment (including watersheds, forests and wildlife) and preservation of
monuments or places or objects of artistic or historic interest, and the advancement of any
other object of general public utility:
Provided that the advancement of any other object of general public utility shall not be a
charitable purpose, if it involves the carrying on of any activity in the nature of trade,
commerce or business, or any activity of rendering any service in relation to any trade,
commerce or business, for a cess or fee or any other consideration, irrespective of the
nature of use or application, or retention, of the income from such activity:"

7 ITR 415 : AIR 1939 PC 208 held that : (P. Krishna Warriar case, SCR pp. 45-46)
"
This Court in J.K. Trust V. CIT (Excess Profits Tax), (1957) 32 ITR 535 (SC) endorsed the
said view and held that "property" is a term of the widest import and that business would
undoubtedly be property unless there was something to the contrary in the enactment. If
business was property, it could be held under trust for religious and charitable purposes. As
the business of running the Arya Vaidya Sala vested under trust for religious and charitable
purposes, it would fall under clause (i), if the other conditions laid down therein were
satisfied."

Section 4(3) of the Income Tax Act, 1922 amended by the Indian Income Tax (Amendment)
Act, 1939, reads as follows:
"4. (3) Any income, profits or gains falling within the following classes shall not be included in
the total income of the person receiving them:
(i) subject to the provisions of clause (c) of sub-section (1) of Section 16, any income
derived from property held under trust or other legal obligation wholly for religious or
charitable purposes, insofar as such income is applied or accumulated for application to such
religious or charitable purposes as relate to anything done within the taxable territories, and
in the case of property so held in part only for such purposes, the income applied or finally
set apart for application thereto:
(ia) Any income derived from business carried on behalf of a religious or charitable institution
when the income is applied solely to the purposes of the institution and-
(a) the business is carried on in the course of the carrying out of a primary purpose of the
institution, or
(b) the work in connection with the business is mainly carried on by beneficiaries of the
institution;"
9
Section 4 of the Income Tax (Amendment) Act, 1953 added proviso to Section 4(3)(i); it
reads as follows:
"Provided that such income shall be included in the total income-
[(a) if it is applied to religious or charitable purposes without the taxable territories, but in
the following cases, namely-
(i) where the property is held under trust or other legal obligation created before the
commencement of the Indian Income Tax (Amendment) Act, 1953 (25 of 1953), and the
income therefrom is applied to such purposes without the taxable territories; and
(ii) where the property is held under trust or other legal obligation created after such
commencement, and the income therefrom is applied without the taxable territories to
charitable purposes which tend to promote international welfare in which India is interested,
the Central Board of Revenue may, by general or special order, direct that it shall not be
included in the total income;
(b) in the case of income derived from business carried on on behalf of a religious or
charitable institution, unless the income is applied wholly for the purposes of the institution
and either-
(i) the business is carried on in the course of the actual carrying out of a primary purpose of
the institution, or
(ii) the work in connection with the business is mainly carried on by beneficiaries of the
institution;
(c) if it is applied to purposes other than religious or charitable purposes or ceases to be
accumulated or set apart for application thereto in which case it shall be deemed to be the
income of the year in which it is so applied or ceases to be so accumulated or set apart.]"

The expression "business" though extensively used is a word of indefinite import, in
taxing statutes it is used in the sense of an occupation, or profession which occupies the
time, attention and labour of a person, normally with the object of making profit. To regard
an activity as business there must be a course of dealings, either actually continued or
contemplated to be continued with a profit motive, and not for sport or pleasure. But to be a
dealer a person need not follow the activity of buying, selling and supplying the same
commodity. Mere buying for personal consumption i.e. without a profit motive will not make a
person a dealer within the meaning of the Act, but a person who consumes a commodity
bought by him in the course of his trade, or use in manufacturing another commodity for sale,
would be regarded as a dealer." (H. Abdul Bakhi case, AIR p. 532, para 4)

97 "5. Streamlining the definition of "charitable purpose"
5.1. Sub-section (15) of Section 2 of the Act defines "charitable purpose" to include relief of
the poor, education, medical relief, and the advancement of any other object of general
public utility. This is based on the argument that they are engaged in the "advancement of
an object of general public utility" as is included in the fourth limb of the current 12. It has
been noticed that a number of entities operating on commercial lines are claiming exemption
on their income either under sub-section (23-C) of Section 10 or Section 11 of the Act on
the ground that they are charitable institutions. This is based on the argument that they are
engaged in the "advancement of an object of general public utility" as is included in the
fourth limb of the current definition of "charitable purpose". Such a claim, when made in
respect of an activity carried out on commercial lines, is contrary to the intention of the
provision.
5.2. With a view to limiting the scope of the phrase "advancement of any other object of
general public utility", sub-section (15) of Section 2 has been amended to provide that the
advancement of any other object of general public utility shall not be a charitable purpose, if
it involves the carrying on of any activity in the nature of trade, commerce or business, or
any activity of rendering any service in relation to any trade, commerce or business, for a
cess or fee or any other consideration, irrespective of the nature of use or application, or
retention, of the income from such activity."

`13. A statute, as passed by Parliament, is the expression of the collective intention of the
legislature as a whole, and any statement made by an individual, albeit a Minister, of the
intention and objects of the Act cannot be used to cut down the generality of the words
used in the statute."
At the same time, later decisions have relaxed the rigour of this rule. In K.P. Varghese V. ITO,
"8.
Now it is true that the speeches made by the Members of the Legislature on the floor
of the House when a Bill for enacting a statutory provision is being debated are inadmissible
for the purpose of interpreting the statutory provision but the speech made by the Mover of
the Bill explaining the reason for the introduction of the Bill can certainly be referred to for
the purpose of ascertaining the mischief sought to be remedied by the legislation and the
object and purpose for which the legislation is enacted."

property and income of a State shall be exempt from Union taxation.
(2) Nothing in clause (1) shall prevent the Union from imposing, or authorising the imposition
of, any tax to such extent, if any, as Parliament may by law provide in respect of a trade or
business of any kind carried on by, or on behalf of, the Government of a State, or any
operations connected therewith, or any property used or occupied for the purposes of such
trade or business, or any income accruing or arising in connection therewith.
(3) Nothing in clause (2) shall apply to any trade or business, or to any class of trade or
business, which Parliament may by law declare to be incidental to the ordinary functions of
government."

Per Jeevan Reddy, J.-For example, almost every State Government maintains one or
more guest houses in Delhi for accommodating their officials and others connected with the
affairs of the State. But, when some rooms/accommodation are not occupied by such
persons and remain vacant, outsiders are accommodated therein, though at higher rates.
This activity cannot obviously be called carrying on trade or business nor can it be said that
the building is used or occupied for the purpose of any trade or business carried on by the
State Government.
