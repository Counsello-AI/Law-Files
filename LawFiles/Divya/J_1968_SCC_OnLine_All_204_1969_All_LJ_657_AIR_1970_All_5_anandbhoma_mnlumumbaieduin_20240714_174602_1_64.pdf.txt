Cri LJ 132 (FB)
In the High Court of Allahabad
(Full Bench)
(BEFORE V.G. OAK, C.J. AND W. BROOME, D.S MATHUR, B.D. GUPTA, GYANENDRA KUMAR,
M.H. BEG, YASHODA NANDAN, T.P. MUKERJEE AND C.D. PAREKH, JJ.)
Rishi Kesh Singh and others
Appellants;
Versus
State Respondent.
Cri. Appeal No. 2567 of 1964
Decided on October 18, 1968
The Judgment of the Court was delivered by
OAK, C.J.: - The question before the Full Bench is:
"Whether the dictum of this Court in the case of Prabhoo V. Emperor1 to the effect
that the accused who puts forward a plea based on a general exception in the Penal
Code, 1860 is entitled to be acquitted if upon a consideration of the evidence as a
whole (including the evidence given in support of the plea based on such a general
exception) a reasonable doubt is created in the mind of the Court whether the
accused person is entitled to the benefit of the said exception is still good law."
2. I have read the judgment prepared by my learned brother Mathur, J. In my
opinion, the statement of law in Prabhoo's case is not accurate, and needs
qualification.
3. Sec. 105, Indian Evidence Act states:-
"When a person is accused of any offence, the burden of proving the existence of
circumstances bringing the case within any of the General Exceptions in the Penal
Code, 1860, or within any special exception or proviso contained in any other part
of the same Code, or in any law defining the offence, is upon him, and the Court
shall presume the absence of such circumstances."
4. Mr. P.C. Chaturvedi, appearing for the appellants conceded that when an accused
pleads an exception in the Penal Code, 1860, the burden of proof lies upon him.
Parties are not agreed as to the manner in which the burden may be discharged. One
can conceive three different modes: (1) by proving the exception beyond all resonable
doubt; (2) by proof through preponderance of probabilitius; and (3) by creating a
reasonable doubt in the mind of the court. According to the learned Advocate-General,
the second mode is the correct solution. According to Mr. Chaturvedi, the third mode is
the correct method. It is well settled that when burden of proof lies upon an accused
person, he need not prove his case beyond all reasonable doubt. We may therefore
confine our attention to the second and the third alternatives.
5. According to Sec. 3 of the Evidence Act, a fact is said to be proved when, after
considering the matters before it, the court believes it to exist, or considers its
existence so probable that a prudent man ought, under the circumstances of the
particular case, to act upon the supposition that it exists. It will be seen that a fact
may be said to be proved under one of the two
possible situations. Either the court believes that the fact exists, or the court considers
existence of the fact probable. There is no indication in Sec. 3 of the Evidence Act that
a
fact can be said to be proved, even when the court entertains a reasonable doubt as
to whether the fact exists or not.
6. Mr. P.C. Chaturvedi contended that unless an accused person is given the benefit
of reasonable doubt on an exception, there will be miscarriage of justice in many
cases. Suppose two persons, A and B quarrel at a lonely place, and cause injuries to
each other. They are both prosecuted in two cross-cases. In neither case will the
accused be able to produce an independent witness to prove that he was the victim of
an assault by his oppenent. The plea of private defence will fail in each case. The
result will be that each case will end in conviction. In most of such cases the accused
in one case ought to be acquitted. The same difficulty will arise, when an accused
pleads the right of private defence of property, but is unable to collect reliable
evidence in support of his plea.
7. I think, such cases would be rare. In most cases the accused person is in a
position to substantiate the plea of private defence. If the question is whether the
complainant or the accused was in possession ever a field in dispute, the accused is
generally in a position to establish his plea by producing local residents and village
papers in his support.
8. In Jhumman V. The State of Punjab-subscript(2) it was observed on page 474:-
"In such a case where a mutual conflict develops and there is no reliable and
acceptable evidence as to how it started and as to who was the aggressor, would it
be correct to assume private defence for both sides? We are of the view that such a
situation does not permit of the plea of private defence on either side and would be
a case of sudden fight and conflict and has to be dealt with under Sec. 200, I.P.C.
Exception 4."
9. Chapter IV of the Penal Code, 1860 deal with general exceptions. The right of
private defence has been mentioned in Sec. 96 under Chapter IV of the Penal Code,
1860. Insanity has been mentioned in Sec. 84, I.P.C. Under the Indian Law, a plea of
insanity and a plea of private defence stand on the same footing. Under the English
law, a plea of insanity is treated on the same footing as a statutory exception. It
appears that under the English law, a plea of private defence is not treated on the
same footing as a plea of insanity or a statutory exception. That makes the task of an
accused pleading private defence comparatively easy. If it is considered that the law in
India should be brought in line with the English law, Sec. 96 can be deleted from the
Penal Code, 1860.
10. In State of Madras V. Vaidyanatha Iyer3 the Court was dealing with a case
under the Prevention of Corruption Act. The High Court of Madras observed in its
judgment thus:
"In any case, the evidence is not enough to show that the explanation offered by
the accused cannot reasonably be true, and so, the benefit of doubt must go to
him."
11. This observation of the High Court was not approved by the Supreme Court.
The Supreme Court remarked that the approach of the High Court indicates a
disregard of the presumption which the law requires to be raised under Sec. 4 of the
Act.
12. C.S.D. Swami V. The State4 was also a case under the Prevention of Corruption
Act. It was held that after the conditions laid down in the earlier part of sub-sec. (3) of
Sec. 5 of the Act have been fulfilled by evidence to the satisfaction of the Court, the
Court has got to raise the presumption that the accused is guilty of criminal
misconduct in the discharge of his official duties, and this presumption continues to
hold the field unless the contrary is proved, that is to say, unless the Court is satisfied
that the statutory presumption has been rebutted by cogent evidence.
13. In K.M. Nanavati V. State of Maharashtra5
Subba Rao, J. observed on page 617:
"The alleged conflict between the general burden which lies on the prosecution and
the special burden imposed on the accused under Sec. 105 of the Evidence Act is
more imaginary than real. Indeed, there is no conflict at all. There may arise three
different situations: (1) A statute may throw the burden of proof of all or some of
the ingrediants of an offence on the accused
(2) The special burden may not
touch the ingredients of the offence, but only the protection given on the
assumption of the proof of the said ingredients
(3) It may relate to an
exception, some of the many circumstances required to attract the exception if
proved affecting the proof of all or some of the ingredients of the offence
In
the second case, the burden of bringing the case under the exception lies on the
accused
the general burden to prove the ingredients of the offence, unless
there is a specific statute to the contrary, is always on the prosecution, but the
burden to prove the circumstances coming under the exceptions lies upon the
accused. The failure on the part of the accused to establish all the circumstances
bringing his case under the exception does not absolve the prosecution to prove the
ingredients of the offence; indeed, the evidence, though insufficient to establish the
exception, may be sufficient to negative one or more of the ingredients of the
offence."
14. In Bhikari V. State of U.P.6 the Court quoted with approval the following
passage from Dahyabhai V. State of Gujarat-:
"The doctrine of burden of proof in the context of the plea of insanity may be stated
in the following propositions. (1) The prosecution must prove beyond reasonable
doubt that the accused had committed the offence with the requisite mens rea; and
the burden of proving that always rests on the prosecution from the beginning to
the end of the trial. (2) There is a rebuttable presumption that the accused was not
insane, when he committed the crime the accused may rebut it by placing
before the Court all the relevant evidence-oral, documentary or circumstantial, but
the burden of proof upon him is no higher than that rests upon a party to civil
proceedings.
"
15. In Harbhajan Singh V. State of Punjab it was observed on page 101:
"Where the burden of an issue lies upon the accused, he is not required to
discharge that burden by leading evidence to prove his case beyond a reasonable
doubt. That, no doubt, is the test prescribed while deciding weather the prosecution
has discharged its onus to prove the guilt of the accused; but that is not a test
which can be applied to an accused person who seeks to prove substantially his
claim that his case falls under an Exception, where an accused person is called upon
to prove that his case falls under an Exception, law treats the onus as discharged if
the accused person succeeds 'in proving a preponderance of probability'."
16. Similarly, in V.D. Jhingan V. State of U.P.Â° it was observed on page 1764:
"It is sufficient if the accused person succeeds in proving a preponderance of
probability in favour of his case. It is not necessary for the accused person to prove
his case beyond a reasonable doubt or in default to incur a verdict of guilty. The
onus of proof lying upon the accused person is to prove his case by a
preponderance of probability."
17. Likewise, in Munshi Ram V. Delhi Administration10 it was observed on page 703:
"It is well settled that even if an accused does not plead self-defence, it is open to
the court to consider such a plea if the same arises from the material on record
The burden of establishing that plea is on the accused and that burden can
be discharged by showing preponderance of probabilities in favour of
that plea on the basis of the material on record."
18. It is to be noted that in Munshi Ram's10 case the accused raised the plea of
private defence. So, the decision of the Supreme Court in Munshi Ram's10 case is
directly applicable to the present case.
19. It will be seen that it is settled law that when the burden of proof lies upon an
accused person under Sec. 105, Indian Evidence Act, that burden can be discharged
by showing preponderance of probabilities. This position is inconsistent with the stand
taken by the majority of the Full Bench in Prabhoo's1 case that it is sufficient for
purposes of defence that the accused should create a reasonable doubt in the mind of
the Court whether the accused person is entitled to the benefit of the exception or not.
Preponderance of probabilities implies balance of evidence. In order to succeed, the
accused must make out balance of evidence in his favour. The Court may entertain a
reasonable doubt even if the balance of evidence is in favour of the prosecution. So,
creating reasonable doubt cannot be equated with proof by preponderance of
probabilities.
20. Mr. P.C. Chaturvedi contended that under Sec. 105, Indian Evidence Act, the
position of the accused is the same as that of an accused in a prosecution under Sec.
411, I.P.C. read with Sec. 114, Indian Evidence Act. Reliance was placed on Otto
Ganrge Gfeller V. The King11. In Dhanvantrai V. State of MaharashtraÂ¹2 it was explained
that the position of the accused under Sec. 105, Indian Evidence Act is not the same
as that of an accused in a prosecution under Sec. 411, I.P.C. It was explained on
pages 579 and 580:
"That, however, was a case where the question before the jury was whether a
presumption of the kind which in India may be raised under Sec. 114 of the
Evidence Act could be raised from the fact of possession of goods recently stolen,
that the possessor of the goods was either a thief or receiver of stolen property. In
the case before us, however, the presumption arises not under Sec. 114 of the
Evidence Act but under Sec. 4(1) of the Prevention of Corruption Act.
the
Court has no choice in the matter, once it is established that the accused person
has received a sum of money which was not due to him as a legal remuneration.
The burden resting on the accused person in such a case would not be as
light as it is where a presumption is raised under Sec. 114 of the Evidence Act and
cannot be held to be discharged merely by reason of the fact that the explanation
offered by the accused is reasonable and probable. It must further be shown that
the explanation is a true one."
21. This passage shows that for purposes of Sec. 105, Indian Evidence Act, it is not
sufficient for the defence to make out that the explanation offered by the accused is
plausible. The accused has to make out his case affirmatively.
22. Although a reasonable doubt arising under an exception may not secure an
acquittal as a matter of course, in some cases the accused can secure an acquittal
indirectly. There may be cases where, although the exception has not been proved, the
evidence on record creates a doubt as regards some element which is an ingredient of
the offence. Suppose, the accused is charged with an offence involving a certain
intention or a certain object as an ingredient. It may happen that, as a result of the
attempt of the accused to establish a particular exception, he succeeds in taking the
prosecution case as regards the necessary intention or object which is an ingredient of
the offence. In such a case the accused will have to be acquitted. The reason of
acquittal will be, not proof of the exception but failure of the prosecution to prove a
necessary ingredient of the offence.
23. In Dahyabhai V. State of Gujarat- It was observed on page 1367:
"The evidence so placed may not be sufficient to discharge the burden under Sec.
105 of the Evidence Act, but it may raise a reasonable doubt in the mind of a judge
as regards one or other of the necessary ingredients of the offence itself. It
may for instance, raise a reasonable doubt in the mind of the judge whether the
accused had the requisite intention laid down in Sec. 229 of the Penal Code, 1860."
24. It was further observed on page 1568:
"Even if the accused was not able to establish conclusively that he was insane at
the time he committed the offence, the evidence placed before the court by the
accused or by the prosecution may raise a reasonable doubt in the mind of the
court as regards one or more of the ingredients of the offence, including mens rea
of the accused and in that case the court would be entitled to acquit the accused on
the ground that the general burden of proof resting on the prosecution was not
discharged."
25. In Bhikari V. State of U.P.6 it was observed on page 3: -
"If upon the evidence adduced in the case whether by the prosecution or by the
accused a reasonable doubt is created in the mind of the Court as regards one or
more of the ingredients of the offence including mens rea of the accused he would
be entitled to be acquitted.
26. Mr. P.C. Chaturvedi contested that exceptions are ingredients of every offence.
For this contention, he relied upon Sec. 6 of the Penal Code. Sec. 6, I.P.C. states:-
"Throughout this Code every definition of an offence, every penal provision and
every illustration of every such definition or penal provision, shall be underwood
subject to the exception contained in he chapter entitled 'General Exceptions,
hough these exceptions are not repeated in such definition, penal provision or
illustration."
27. Sec. 6, I.P.C. is merely a device to avoid quoting langthy exceptions in
description of offences. Strictly speaking, an exception cannot be treated as an
ingredient of in offence. Further, Sec. 105 of the Evidence Act expressly lays down
that the court shall presume absence of circumstances bringing a case within any of
the general exceptions in the Penal Code, 1860. So, assuming that exceptions
constitute ingredients of offences, the court is bound to start with a presumption that
circumstances bringing the case under any general exception do not exist.
Consequently, the question whether exceptions constitute ingredients of offences or
not is merely of academic interest.
28. Creating a reasonable doubt under an exception may not always enable the
accused to secure an acquittal. Suppose the accused is charged under Sec. 325, I.P.C.
It is proved that the accused voluntarily caused grievous hurt to the complainant. The
incident took place in certain field. The accused pleads that he was in possession over
the field, and acted in the right of private defence of property. Although the accused
produces some evidence, the plea of private defence is not made out. The evidence is
of such a character that the court entertains a reasonable doubt as to whether the
complainant or the accused was in possession. In such a case the position would be
this. On the one hand, it is proved that the accused voluntarily caused grievous hurt to
the complainant. On the other hand, the accused failed to establish his plea of private
defence. In such a case the accused has to be convicted under Sec. 325, I.P.C.
Reasonable doubt on one part of the case is of no avail.
29. It will be seen that the majority in Prabhoo's case was not right is assuming
that the accused has to be acquitted whenever the Court entertains a reasonable
doubt as to whether the accused is entitled to the benefit of a certain exception or not.
It all depends on the circumstances of each case. If the prosecution case is damaged
as regards some ingredient of the offence, the accused will be acquitted. But if all the
ingredients of the offence are established, the accused has to be convicted.
30. It may be that law as explained above causes miscarriage of justice in some
cases. But Courts have no power to alter statute law. The position indicated above is
the combined effect of Chapter IV of the Penal Code, 1860, Sec. 3 of the Evidence Act
and Sec. 105 of the Evidence Act. If it is considered that the present legal position is
unsatisfactory, it is open to Parliament
and State Legislatures to make the necessary amendments in the Penal Code, 1860
and the Indian Evidence Act.
31. In my opinion, the proposition of law laid down in Prabhoo V. Emperor1 has
been too broadly stated, and needs qualification. The true legal position is this.
Whenever an accused person raises a plea based on some general exception, the
burden of proof lies upon him under Sec. 105, Indian Evidence Act. That burden has to
be discharged by preponderance of probabilities. So far as the accused is concerned,
the standard of proof is the same as the standard of proof for a plaintiff or a defendant
in Civil Proceedings. The accused cannot always secure an acquittal by merely creating
a reasonable doubt in the mind of the Court as to whether the accused person is
entitled to the benefit of the exception or not. If the nature of the case is such that a
reasonable doubt arises as regards some ingredient of the offence, the accused is
entitled to an acquittal. In other cases, a reasonable doubt as regards a certain
exception will not entitle the accused to an acquittal.
32. BROOME, GUPTA and PAREKH, JJ.: We are in general agreement with the
conclusions arrived at by Mathur, J. in this case (except that we would prefer to say
that the Full Bench pronouncement in Prabhoo's1 case calls for elucidation rather than
emendation). He has discussed the problem at considerable length and we do not
consider it necessary to repeat the reasoning followed by him or his discussion of the
case law. We would like, however, to add a few words of our own so as to leave no
room for doubt as to our views regarding cases where the right of private defence is
pleaded under Sec. 96, I.P.C.
33. An accused person who puts forward the plea of private defence will seek to
prove it from the material on record, consisting of defence evidence, oral or
documentary, and admissions elicited from the prosecution; and he can derive
advantage from such material in two ways. In the first place, if this material is
sufficient to show that the plea of private defence is more probable than the
prosecution case, the plea will be taken as proved and the accused will be entitled to
acquittal on the ground that he has discharged the onus laid on him by Sec. 105 of
the Evidence Act. Alternatively, if this material (read in conjunction with the other
evidence on record) is found to create a reasonable doubt in the mind of the court
regarding something that is required to be proved by the prosecution in order to
establish the accused's guilt, the accused will be entitled to acquittal on the ground
that the prosecution has failed to discharge the primary burden that lies on it in all
criminal cases. In the vast majority of offences, mens rea is one of the essentials that
the prosecution has to establish before the crime can be said to be proved; and a
reasonable doubt as to whether mens rea is present or not must inevitably lead to
acquittal. A person who inflicts harm in a lawful manner in order to protect his person
or property is clearly devoid of mens rea; and if the material relied upon by the
accused creates a doubt as to whether he acted in exercise of the right of private
defence, a doubt will simultaneously arise as to whether he had the mens rea that
must be proved in order to make his act a punishable offence. In such circumstances
he will have to be given the benefit of the doubt regarding this essential prerequisite
of the prosecution case and will be entitled to acquittal.
34. OAK, C.J., in his separate judgment, has considered a case in which an accused
who has caused grievous hurt to the complainant in a dispute over a field pleads that
he was in possession of the field and that he acted in private defence of his property;
and the evidence produced, though insufficient to prove the plea, is enough to create a
reasonable doubt as to which of the parties was actually in possession. In such a case,
according to Oak, C.J., the accused must be convicted. With this view, however, we
most respectfully but emphatically disagree. If the court were to find, in a case of that
nature, that the evidence gave rise to a reasonable doubt as to whether the disputed
field was in the possession of the complainant or of the accused at the time of the
incident, a simultaneous doubt would arise as to whether the accused bad the
necessary mens rea to make
him guilty of the offence of grievous hurt; and in such circumstances the accused
would in our opinion have to be acquitted on the ground that the prosecution had
failed to prove beyond reasonable doubt an essential part of its case.
35. This, in our opinion, is precisely what the decision in Prabhoo V. Emperor1 was
meant to convey. The judgments of all the four Judges supporting the majority view in
that case lay stress on the overriding need for the prosecution to discharge the burden
of proving the accused guilty of the crime. Iqbal Ahmad, C.J. remarked:-
"In cases falling within the purview of Sec. 105, the law placed on the accused the
minor burden of bringing his case within the exception or proviso relied upon by
him. There is however nothing in the Evidence Act to indicate that the failure of the
accused to discharge the burden lightens the burden placed on the prosecution by
Sec. 102."
36. And Bajpai, J. observed:
"it is open to the Court to consider whether the entire evidence proves to the
satisfaction of the Court that the accused is entitled to the benefit of the exception
and the charge levelled against him has not been established or that there is a
reasonable doubt as to the guilt of the accused, and in both cases the accused
would be entitled to an acquittal." and further:
"If there is such doubt (i.e. as to the plea of the right of private defence), has not a
doubt been cast in connexion with the entire case and if that is so, is not the
accused entitled to an acquittal? I think he is, and that is so because of the
constant immutable primal burden resting on the prosecution."
37. Ismail, J. also observed:-
"The decision on the question of self defence will be only a decision upon one of the
issues in the case. The court at the end of the trial has still to see whether having
regard to the entire evidence and the circumstances of the case, the charge is
proved beyond reasonable doubt."
38. And finally Mulla, J. held:
"There is nothing in the language of Sec. 105 to warrant the conclusion that the law
intended such a result and for that purpose enacted Sec. 105, Evidence Act, in
order to curtail the fundamental right of the accused to claim an acquittal if there is
any reasonable doubt about his guilt."
39. We are fully satisfied, therefore, that although the dictum in Prabhoo's1 case
may be said to be somewhat unhappily worded, it is fundamentally correct and calls
for no amendment. When the learned Judges who decided that case stated that "the
accused person is entitled to be acquitted if upon a consideration of the evidence as a
whole (including the evidence given in support of the plea of the said general
exception), a reasonable doubt is created in the mind of the Court whether the
accused person is or is not entitled to the benefit of the said exception", they had in
mind the doubt that may arise, on a consideration of the entire evidence (both
prosecution and defence), with regard to the discharge of the primary burden resting
on the prosecution to prove the guilt of the accused. That guilt can only be established
if the prosecution is able to prove beyond reasonable doubt all the essentials that go
to make up the offence, including the fundamental requirement of mens rea. As
already pointed out, a doubt regarding the existence of mens rea must necessarily
arise whenever there is a doubt in the mind of the court as to whether the accused is
entitled to the benefit of a general exception such as the right of private defence.
Viewed in this light, the dictum of the Full Bench in Prabhoo's1 case is perfectly sound
and requires no modification.
40. Our reply to the question that has been referred to the present Full Bench for
decision, therefore, is in the affirmative.
41. MATHUR, J.: - The question referred to this Full Bench is as below:-
"Whether the dictum of this Court in the case of Prabhoo V. Emperor1 to the effect
that the accused who puts forward a plea based on a general exception in the Penal
Code, 1860 is entitled to be acquitted if upon a consideration of the evidence as a
whole (including the evidence
given in support of the plea based on such a general exception) a reasonable doubt is
created in the mind of the Court whether the accused person is entitled to the benefit
of the said exception is still good law."
42. The material facts of the case are that Rishi Kesh Singh and eight others were
tried for offences punishable under Secs. 147 or 148 and 323, 324, 325 and 307,
I.P.C., read with Sec. 149, I.P.C., for forming an unlawful assembly with the common
object to cause injuries to Sudarshan Singh, Jai Govind Singh and Hirdanand Singh
and for causing injuries to them. Some of the accused persons took the plea that they
had caused the injuries in the right of private defence of their property and person.
The Sessions Judge did not accept this plea and convicted the accused persons of the
various offences detailed above. They preferred an appeal which came up for hearing
before Asthana, J. The appellants relied upon the Full decision of this Court in the case
of Prabhoo V. Emperor-, and contended that they were entitled to the benefit of the
Exception pleaded even though the Exception was not proved, and only a reasonable
doubt was created in the mind of the Court. The Government Advocate, however,
urged that the dictum laid down in the majority judgment was, in view of the
Supreme Court decisions, no longer a good law, and that the existence of a reasonable
doubt could be no ground to give the accused persons the benefit of the Exception.
The question being of importance, Asthana, J. after framing the question referred the
matter to a larger Bench. This reference came up for hearing before Uniyal and Capoor,
JJ., who were of opinion that the decision of the Supreme Court "appear to have cast a
cloud of doubt on the rule of law laid down in the majority decision" in the above case
and the aforesaid decision required reconsideration. They slightly modified the
question and referred it to a larger Bench for consideration. The question as modified
by Uniyal and Capoor, JJ. has already been reproduced above.
43. At the very outset it may be observed that all the questions involved or which
can be said to be in issue pertaining go the scope and effect of Sec. 105 of the
Evidence Act in criminal trials are concluded by the decisions of the Supreme Court,
though in different circumstances. General Exceptions pleaded in those cases were
under Secs. 80 and 84, I.P.C., that is, accident and insanity. One case refers to the
Exception to Sec. 499, I.P.C. (Defamation). The other two cases relate to the statutory
presumption under the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1947. The main point for
consideration is whether the rule laid down in those Supreme Court decisions applies
with equal force to all the General Exceptions and the special Exception or proviso
contained in the Penal Code, 1860. The case of Prabhoo1 related to the right of private
defence (Sec. 96, I.P.C.) and a similar plea was raised in defence in the instant case.
We shall, therefore, confine ourselves chiefly to this General Exception though
reference shall be made to other Exceptions, if necessary. An attempt shall be made to
lay down the law which can be applied to all the cases in which the benefit of the
General Exception or special Exception or proviso is claimed.
44. Where there exist clear decisions of the Supreme Court, it is not necessary to
make comments on the English decisions, or the decisions of the High Courts in India,
for the simple reason that the law laid down by the Supreme Court is binding on all
within the territory of India. However, we shall make reference to the various reported
cases brought to our notice making comments wherever necessary.
45. K.M. Nanawati V. State of Maharasthra5 is the leading case on the scope and
effect of Sec. 105 of the Evidence Act. It will save time by reproducing in extenso the
observations made therein, which are as below:-
"The legal impact of the said provisions on the question of burden of proof may be
stated thus: In India, as it is in England, there is a presumption of innocence in
favour of the accused as a general rule, and it is the duty of the prosecution
to prove the guilt of the accused; to put it in other words the accused is presumed to
be innocent until his guilt is established by the prosecution. But when an accused
relies upon the General Exceptions in the Penal Code, 1860 or on any special exception
or proviso contained in any other part of the Penal Code, or in any law defining an
offence, Sec. 105 of the Evidence Act raises a presumption against the accused and
also throws a burden on him to rebut the said presumption. Under that section the
Court shall presume the absence of circumstances bringing the case within any of the
exceptions, that is, the Court shall regard the non-existence of such circumstances as
proved till they are disproved. An illustration based on the facts of the present case
may bring out the meaning of the said provision. The prosecution alleges that the
accused intentionally shot the deceased; but the accused pleads that, though the
shots emanated from his revolver and hit the deceased, it was by accident, that is, the
shots went off the revolver in the course of a struggle in the circumstances mentioned
in Sec. 80 of the Penal Code, 1860 and hit the deceased resulting in his death. The
Court then shall presume the absence of circumstances bringing the case within the
provisions of Sec. 80 of the Penal Code, 1860, that is, it shall presume that the
shooting was not by accident, and that the other circumstances bringing the case
within the exception did not exist; but this presumption may be rebutted by the
accused by adducing evidence to support his plea of accident in the circumstances
mentioned therein. This presumption may also be rebutted by admissions made or
circumstances elucidated by the evidence led by the prosecution or by the combined
effect of such circumstances and the evidence adduced by the accused. But the
section does not in any way affect the burden that lies on the prosecution to prove all
the ingredients of the offence with which the accused is charged: that burden never
shifts. The alleged conflict between the general burden which lies on the prosecution
and the special burden imposed on the accused under Sec. 105 of the Evidence Act is
more imaginary than real. Indeed, there is no conflict at all. There may arise three
different situations: (1) A statute may throw the burden of proof of all or some of the
ingredients of an offence on the accused: (see Secs. 4 and 5 of the Prevention of
Corruption Act). (2) The special burden may not touch the ingredients of the offence,
but only the protection given on the assumption of the proof of the said ingredients:
(see Secs. 77, 78, 79, 81 and 88 of the Penal Code, 1860). (3) It may relate to an
exception, some of the many circumstances required to attract the exception of proved
affecting the proof of all or some of the ingredients of the offence: (see Sec. 80 of the
Penal Code, 1860). In the first case burden of (the) proving the igredients or some of
the ingredients of the offence, as the case may be, lies on the accused. In the second
case, the burden of bringing the case under the exception lies on the accused. In the
third case, though the burden lies on the accused to bring his case within the
exception, the facts proved may not discharge the said burden, but may affect the
proof of the ingredients of the offence. An illustration may bring out the meaning. The
prosecution has to prove that the accused shot dead the deceased intentionally and
thereby committed the offence of murden within the meaning of Sec. 300 of the Penal
Code, 1860; the prosecution has to prove the ingredients of murder, and one of the
ingredients of that offence is that the accused intentionally shot the deceased; the
accused pleads that he shot at the deceased by accident without any intention or
knowledge in the doing of a lawful act in a lawful manner by lawful means with proper
care and caution: the accused against whom a presumption is drawn under Sec. 105
of the Evidence Act that the shooting was not by accident in the circumstances
mentioned in Sec. 80 of the Penal Code, 1860, may adduce evidence to rebut that
presumption. That evidence may not be sufficient to prove all the incredients of Sec.
80 of the Penal Code, 1860, but may prove that the shooting was by accident or
inadvertence, i.e., it was done without any intention or requisite state of mind, which
is the essence of the offence,
within the meaning of Sec. 300, Penal Code, 1860 on the essential ingredients of the
offence of murder. In that event, though the accused failed to establish to bring his
case within the terms of Sec. 80 of the Penal Code, 1860, the Court may hold that the
ingredients of the offence have not been established or that the prosecution has not
made out the case against the accused. In this view it might be said that the general
burden to prove, the ingredients of the offence, unless there is a specific statute to the
contrary, is always on the prosecution, but the burden to prove the circumstances
coming under the exceptions lies upon the accused. The failure on the part of the
accused to establish all the circumstances bringing his case under the exception does
not absolve the prosecution to prove the ingredients of the offence; indeed, the
evidence, though insufficient to establish the exception, may be sufficient to negative
one or more of the ingredients of the offence."
"As in England so in India, the prosecution must prove the guilt of the accused, i.e.,
it must establish all the ingredients of the offence with which he is charged. As in
England so also in India, the general burden of proof is upon the prosecution; and
if, on the basis of the evidence adduced by the prosecution or by the accused, there
is a reasonable doubt whether the accused committed the offence he is entitled to
the benefit of doubt. In India if an accused pleads an exception within the meaning
of Sec. 80 of the Penal Code, 1860, there is a presumption against him and the
burden to rebut that presumption lies on him. In England there is no provision
similar to Sec. 80 of the Penal Code, 1860, but Viscount Sankey, L.C., makes it
clear that such a burden lies upon the accused if his defence is one of insanity and
in a case where there is a statutory exception to the general rules of burden of
proof. Such an exception we find in Sec. 105 of the Indian Evidence Act."
Further citations are unnecessary as, in our view, the terms of Sec. 105 of the
Evidence Act are clear and unambiguous."
46. The defence plea raised in the above case was that the deceased was killed
accidentally and the death was not the result of any intentional act on the part of the
accused. Benefit was thus claimed of Sec. 80. I.P.C.
47. Dahyabhai Chhaganbhai Thakkar V. State of Gujarat- and Bhikari V. The State of
Uttar Pradesh are cases where the benefit of the General Exception detailed in Sec.
84, I.P.C. was claimed: plea of insanity was invoked by the accused to show that he
was incapable of understanding the nature of the Act done by him and hence was
entitled to acquittal. In Dahyabhai Chhaganbhai Thakkar V. State of Gujarat- the law
was laid down as below:-
"It is fundamental principle of criminal jurisprudence that an accused is presumed
to be innocent and, therefore, the burden lies on the prosecution to prove the guilt
of the accused beyond reasonable doubt. The prosecution, therefore, in a case of
homicide shall prove beyond reasonable doubt that the accused caused death with
the requisite intention described in Sec. 299 of the Penal Code, 1860. This general
burden never shifts and it always rests on the prosecution. But, Sec. 84 of the Penal
Code, 1860 provides that nothing is an offence if the accused at the time of doing
that act, by reason of unsoundness of mind was incapable of knowing the nature of
his act or what he was doing was either wrong or contrary to law. This being an
exception, under Sec. 105 of the Evidence Act the burden of proving the existence
of circumstances bringing the case within the said exception lies on the accused,
and the Court shall presume the absence of such circumstances. Under Sec. 105 of
the Evidence Act, read with the definition of "shall presume" in Sec. 4 thereof, the
court shall regard the absence of such circumstances as proved unless, after
considering the matters before it, it believes that the said circumstances existed or
their existence was so probable that a prudent man ought, under the circumstances
of the particular case, to act upon the supposition that they did exist. To put it in
other words, the accused will have to rebut the presumption that such
circumstances did not exist, by placing material before the court sufficient to make
it consider
the existence of the said circumstances so probable that a prudent man would act
upon them. The accused has to satisfy the standard of a "prudent man" If the
material placed before the court, such as, oral and documentary evidence,
presumptions, admissions or even the prosecution evidence satisfies the test of
"prudent man" the accused will have discharged his burden. The evidence so placed
may not be sufficient to discharge the burden under Sec. 105 of the Evidence Act, but
it may raise a reasonable doubt in the mind of a judge as regards one or other of the
necessary ingredients of the offence itself. It may, for instance, raise a reasonable
doubt in the mind of the judge whether the accused had the requisite intention laid
down in Sec. 299 of the Penal Code, 1860. If the judge has such reasonable doubt, he
has to acquit the accused, for in that event the prosecution would have failed to prove
conclusively the guilt of the accused. There is no conflict between the general burden,
which is always on the prosecution and which never shifts, and the special burden that
rests on the accused to make out his defence of insanity."
"The doctrine of burden of proof in the context of the plea of insanity may be stated
in the following propositions:
(1) The prosecution must prove beyond reasonable doubt that the accused had
committed the offence with the requisite mens rea: and the burden of proving
that always rests on the prosecution from the beginning to the end of the trial.
(2) There is a rebuttable presumption that the accused was not insane, when
he committed the crime, in the sense laid down by Sec. 84 of the Penal Code,
1860: the accused may rebut it by placing before the court all the relevant
evidence oral, documentary or circumstantial, but the burden of proof upon
him is no higher than that rests upon a party to civil proceedings. (3) Even if
the accused was not able to establish conclusively that he was insane at the
time he committed the offence, the evidence placed before the court by the
accused or by the prosecution may raise a reasonable doubt in the mind of the
court as regards one or more of the ingredients of the offence, including mens
rea of the accused and in that case the court would be entitled to acquit the
accused on the ground that the general burden of proof resting on the
prosecution was not discharged."
48. At another place after summarizing the law laid down in K.M. Nanavati V. State
of Maharashtra5, it was observed:
"A Division Bench of the Nagpur High Court in Ramhitram V. State of Madhya
Pradesh13 has struck a different note inasmuch as it held that the benefit of doubt
which the law gives on the presumption of innocence is available only where the
prosecution had not been able to connect the accused with the occurrence and that
it had nothing to do, with the mental state of the accused. With great respect, we
cannot agree with this view. If this view were correct, the Court would be helpless
and would be legally bound to convict an accused even though there was genuine
and reasonable doubt in its mind that the accused had not the requisite intention
when he did the act for which he was charged. This view is also inconsistent with
that expressed in Nanavati's5 case."
49. In Bhihari V. The State of Uttar Pradesh after quoting the passage from
Dahyabhai Chhaganbhai Thakkar V. State of Gujarat-, their Lordships of the Supreme
Court observed as below:-
"This passage does not say anything different from what was said earlier.
Undoubtedly it is for the prosecution to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the
accused had committed the offence with the requisite mens rea. Once that is done
a presumption that the accused was sane when he committed the offence would
arise. This presumption is rebuttable and he can rebut it either by leading evidence
or by relying upon the prosecution evidence itself. If upon the evidence adduced in
the case whether by the prosecution or by the accused a reasonable doubt is
created in the mind of the Court as regards one or
more of the ingredients of the offence including mens rea of the accused he would be
entitled to acquittal. This is very different from saying that the prosecution must also
establish the sanity of the accused at the time of commission of the offence despite
what has been expressly provided for in Sec. 105 of the Evidence Act."
50. In Harbhajan Singh V. State of Punjab only one point was considered in detail
namely, the nature and the extent of evidence which would discharge the onus of
proof placed on an accused person claiming the benefit of an Exception. Observations
on the other point are in consonance with the earlier decision. The relevant
observations made on the point are as below:-
"There is consensus of judicial opinion in favour of the view that where the burden
of an issue lies upon the accused, he is not required to discharge that burden by
leading evidence to prove his case beyond a reasonable doubt. That, no doubt, is
the test prescribed while deciding whether the prosecution has discharged its onus
to prove the guilt of the accused; but that is not a test which can be applied to an
accused person who seeks to prove substantially his claim that his case falls under
an Exception. Where an accused person is called upon to prove that his case falls
under an Exception, law treats the onus as discharged if the accused person
succeeds in proving a preponderance of probability. As soon as the preponderance
of probability is proved, the burden shifts to the prosecution which has still to
discharge its original onus. It must be remembered that basically, the original onus
never shifts and the prosecution has, at all stages of the case, to prove the guilt of
the accused beyond a reasonable doubt. As Phipson has observed, when the burden
of an issue is upon the accused, he is not, in general, called on to prove it beyond a
reasonable doubt or in default to incur a verdict of guilty; it is sufficient if he
succeeds in proving a preponderance of probability, for then the burden is shifted to
the prosecution which has still to discharge its original onus that never shifts, i.e.,
that of establishing, on the whole case, guilt beyond a reasonable doubt."
"It will be recalled that it was with a view to emphasising the fundamental doctrine
of criminal law that the onus to prove its case lies on the prosecution, that Viscount
Sankey in Woolmington V. Director of Public Prosecutions14, observed that "no
matter what the charge or where the trial, the principle that the prosecution must
prove the guilt of the prisoner is part of the common law of England and no attempt
to whittle it down can be entertained." This principle of common law is a part of the
criminal law in this country. That is not to say that if an Exception is pleaded by an
accused person, he is not required to justify his plea: but the degree and character
of proof which the accused is expected to furnish in support of his plea, cannot be
equated with the degree and character of proof expected from the prosecution
which is required to prove its case."
51. Thereafter, after quoting with approval the observations made by Duff, J., R.V.
Clark15 which had been approved by Lord Hailsham in Sodeman V. R.16 and making a
reference to the law laid down in R. V. Carr-Braint17, it was observed as below:-
"What the Court of Criminal Appeal held about the appellant in the said case before
it, is substantially true about the appellant before us. If it can be shown that the
appellant has led evidence to show that he acted in good faith, and by the test of
probabilities that evidence proves his case, he will be entitled to claim the benefit of
Exception Nine. In other words, the onus on an accused person may well be
compared to the onus on a party in civil proceedings, and just as in civil
proceedings the Court trying an issue makes its decision by adopting the test of
probabilities, so must a criminal Court hold that the plea made by the accused is
proved if a preponderance of probability is established by the evidence led by him."
52. Similar observations, though in brief, were made in Munshi Ram V. Delhi
Administration10, which are as below:
"The burden of establishing that plea is on the accused and that burden can be
discharged by showing preponderance of probabilities in favour of that plea of the
basis of the material on record."
53. This is a case where the accused had pleaded alibi; but a suggestion of self
defence was made in the cross-examination of the prosecution witnesses. Defence
evidence on this plea was also adduced. It was observed that it was open to the Court
to consider such a plea of the same arose from the material on record.
54. The other two cases brought to our notice relate to the statutory presumption
under the Prevention of Corruption Act. Such a presumption is also covered by Sec.
105 of Evidence Act. However, for purposes of this case reference need be made to
only one case, V.D. Jhingan V. State of Uttar Pradesh wherein the nature of the
burden of proof placed upon the accused person has been discussed. It was held:-
"The next question arising in this case is as to what is the burden of proof placed
upon the accused person against whom the presumption is drawn under Sec. 4(1)
of the Prevention of Corruption Act. It is well established that where the burden of
an issue lies upon the accused, he is not required to discharge that burden by
leading evidence to prove his case beyond a reasonable doubt. That is, of course,
the test prescribed in deciding whether the prosecution has discharged its onus to
prove the guilt of the accused; but the same test cannot be applied to an accused
person who seeks to discharge the burden placed upon him under Sec. (1) of the
Prevention of Corruption Act. It is sufficient if the accused person succeeds in
proving a preponderance of probability in favour of his case. It is not necessary for
the accused person to prove his case beyond a reasonable doubt or in default of to
incur a verdict of guilty. The onus of prooflying upon the accused person is to prove
his case by a preponderance of probability. As soon as he succeeds in doing so, the
burden is shifted to the prosecution which still has to discharge its original onus
that never shifts, i.e. that of establishing on the whole case the guilt of the accused
beyond a reasonable doubt."
"We are accordingly of the opinion that the burden of proof lying upon the accused
under Sec. (1) of the prevention of Corruption Act will be satisfied if the accused
person establishes his case by a preponderance of probability and it is not
necessary that he should establish his case by the test of proof beyond a reasonable
doubt. In other words, the onus on an accused person may well be compared to the
onus on a party in civil proceedings, and just as in civil proceedings, the Court
trying an issue makes its decision by adopting the test of probabilities, so must a
criminal Court hold that the plea made by the accused is proved if a preponderance
of probability is established by the evidence led by him.
55. In criminal trials where the accused puts forward a plan based on a General
Exception, or a special Exception or priviso in the Penal Code, 1860, three questions
often arise; firstly on whom the burden of proof to establish the existence of the
Exception or the proviso lies; secondly, the nature of evidence that shall justify the
Court to hold that the Exception or proviso has been established; and thirdly, if the
accused has not succeeded to rebut the presumption, how does his inability affect the
result of the case, that is how is the conflict between the general presumption and the
special presumption to be resolved? The rule on the first and third points has been laid
down in Detail in K.M. Nanavati V. State of Maharastras, and this rule was applied to a
case of alleged insanity in Dahyabhai Chhaganbhai Thakkar V. State of Gujrat- A
similar rule was also laid in Bhikari V. State of Uttar Pradesh and Harbhajan Singh V.
State of Punjab
56. For purposes of this reference, we can omit at least not make comments on that
category of cases where the burden of all or some of the ingredients of an offence is
placed on the accused. We are at present
more concerned with the General Exceptions, or special Exception or proviso,
contained in the Penal Code, 1860. Consequently, there can arise two different
situations: (1) where the special burden of proof does not touch the ingredients of the
offence, but only the protection given on the assumption of the proof of the said
ingredients; and (2) it relates to an Exception, some of the many circumstances
required to attract the Exception if proved, affecting the proof of all or some of the
ingredients of the offence. In K.M. Nanavati V. State of Maharashtra5 it was mentioned
that General Exceptions under five sections of the Penal Code, 1860, fall within the
first category. As it was contended before us that such observations were mere obiter
dicta, it shall be proper not to indicate in this order the provisions which would fall in
that category. That shall avoid unnecessary controversy in the future and it shall be for
the judge hearing a particular case to decide whether the case falls in the first or the
second category. If this course be not adopted, it may at occassions become necessary
to refer the matter to a larger Bench which would result in unnecessary waste of time
of this Court.
57. Where the plea raised in defence falls in the first category, the burden of
proving the case under the Exception shall lie on the accused and he shall naturally be
liable to conviction forthwith in case the prosecution has succeeded to establish the
charge beyond reasonable doubt, considering that the Courts of law invariably, first of
all, consider the prosecution case whether the ingredients of the offence of which the
accused is charged have or have not been established beyond reasonable doubt. It is
when the Court is of opinion that the charge has been established beyond reasonable
doubt that the defence plea is looked into. However, where the case falls in the second
category, the Court can acquit the accused if on consideration of the total material on
record and the defence plea, there exists a reasonable doubt in its mind as to all or
any of the ingredients of the offence charged.
58. In the first two reported cases it was also observed that the difference between
the general presumption and the special presumption was more imaginary than real.
In view of this observation it was contended by the learned Advocate for the
appellants that when the result was the same, this Court should refuse to modify the
dictum as such step may lead to utter confusion. It was also contended that a case
under Sec. 80, I.P.C. alone was before the Supreme Court and hence the observations
whereby Secs. 77, 78, 79, 81 and 88 of the Penal Code, 1860 were placed in the first
category were obiter dicta and not binding on this Court. Reliance was also placed
upon Sec. 6, I.P.C. and Sec. (5), Criminal Procedure Code in support of the
contention that all the cases under the Penal Code, 1860 shall fall in one group,
namely, the second group detailed above. In this connection it was mentioned that
when each and every case of the General Exception or the special Exception or proviso
contained in the Penal Code, 1860 shall fall in the same group, this Court should, in
the circumstances detailed above, not disturb the law as had been in existence for
more than 25 years.
59. Theoretically one can lay down how the matters in issue shall be decided: the
prosecution must, first of all, establish its case beyond reasonable doubt and
thereafter consider whether the accused has succeeded in discharging the burden of
proof. With regard to cases falling in the second category, the Court shall have to
consider against whether all or some of the ingredients of the offence charged had bee
a established beyond reasonable doubt. Where the offence has not been established
beyond reasonable doubt, the accused would be entitled to acquittal. While recording
finding on any of these points, the Courts of law have to consider the total evidence on
record, oral, documentary or circumstantial, whether adduced by the prosecution or by
the accused. When the total evidence has to be judged at the initial stage, it can be
said what occasion there is or should be for rejudging the same evidence for recording
a finding on the other two points. It is also contended that when as a result of
reasonable doubt created
in the mind of the Court as to the ingredients of the offence, the accused would be
acquitted, in substance, the acquittal is based upon the doubt created in the mind of
the Court as a result of the Exception pleaded by the accused; and in the
circumstances, it would be better to retain the old dictum, that as consequence of
reasonable doubt it be held that the accused is entitled to the benefit of the Exception.
60. In the administration of justice in India Law prevails over equity and good
conscience, and consequently the provisions of the statute must be given their full
effect unless the enactment is held to be unconstitutional or invalid and it is only in
the absence of an enactment that the matter can be decided on the principles of
equity. In other words, it would be possible for the courts of law to depart from the
provisions contained in Sec. 105 of the Evidence Act only if it can be held that the
Evidence Act is not a complete Code by itself. If it is a complete Code it shall not be
possible to depart from its provisions on the ground of injustice or inequity. Its
provisions must be given their full effect. It is now a settled law that the Evidence Act
is a complete Code, not for assessment of evidence but for evidence which can be
adduced in any suit or proceeding, the circumstances in which such evidence can be
adduced and also on whom the burden of proof lies. This shall be evident from the
preamble and also Sec. 5 thereof. Repeal of Sec. 2 of the Evidence Act shall make no
difference as the repeal of a provision does not revive the provisions which had been
repealed by the repealed provision. In other words, by the repeal of a provision there
is no re-enactment of the provisions which had earlier stood reprealed. See Maharaja
Sris Chandra Nandy V. Rakhalananda Thakur18, The Collector of Gorakhpur V.
Palakdhari Singh19 and Capt, T.W. King V. Mrs. F.E. King20
61. To put it differently if the dictum under reference is contrary to the provisions of
Sec. 105 of the Evidence Act, it must be suitably modified even though the practical
effect thereof in all or most of the cases shall be the same. Further, the law laid down
by High Courts must be expressed in such clear and unambiguous words that no one
may feel any difficulty in enforcing it. The Courts of law do not merely read the
Headnotes or the concluding or operating portion of the judgment. Consequently, if
the dictum is suitably modified, the Courts shall know not only what changes have
been made but why the changes were introduced. They shall thus know the correct
law and how to enforce it and I see no reason why there would exist any confusion in
the mind of anyone. I therefore have no hesitation in suitably modifying the dictum
even though the legality thereof has been challenged after a lapse of 25 years.
62. The prosecution is not, till the end of the trial, discharged of its burden to
establish beyond doubt the guilt of the accused, and it can consequently be said that
no case shall fall in the first category: they shall all be governed by the second group
detailed above; and further when the total evidence has to be re-assessed before
considering the defence plea and also thereafter, what importance does Sec. 105 of
the Evidence Act have which places the burden of proof on the accused person for
establishing the Exception pleaded by him.
Human mind does not like a machine move in only the prescribed manner.
Ordinarily the judge hearing the case shall take an over-all view of the evidence,
irrespective of the mode that may be laid down for assessment of the evidence and
independently of the question of the burden of proof, whether placed on the
prosecution or on the accused; and he shall decide beforehand whether the evidence
on record is sufficient for conviction or the accused is entitled to honourable acquittal
or to the benefit of doubt. But to remove any misapprehension about the two
categories, it would be desirable to lay down which matters must be decided before a
formal opinion is expressed on the defence plea.
64. Offences defined in the Penal Code, 1860 or in other enactments invariably
have more than one ingredient, some of which may not be connected with or CO-
related to the General Exceptions or special Exception or proviso pleaded by the
accused. The various ingredients are established by oral, documentary or
circumstantial evidence as may be adduced by the parties. Before entering into the
defence plea it shall be necessary to consider and to record a finding on the
ingredients of the offence other than those connected with or co-related to the defence
plea. If all such ingredients are established beyond doubt, the Court shall look into the
defence plea to find out whether the presumption contemplated by Sec. 105 of the
Evidence Act has been rebutted, that is, the absence of the circumstances benefit of
which has been sought for has or has not been disproved. If the accused succeeds in
rebutting the presumption, it is an end to the matter and he shall straight off be
acquitted of the offence or convicted of a lesser offence on the ground that some of the
ingredients of the main offence had not been established; but if the accused does not
succeed in rebutting the presumption, that is, in disproving the absence of the
circumstances, the Court shall consider the question from the point of view of general
presumption of the innocence of the accused, whether the ingredients connected with
or co-related to the defence plea have been established beyond doubt. Even though
the accused may not be able to establish his plea, that is, to rebut the presumption
under Sec. 105 of the Evidence Act, he may succeed in creating a reasonable doubt in
the mind of the Court, and what the Courts of law shall say is that because there
exists a reasonable doubt on some of the ingredients of the offence, the benefit
thereof shall go to the accused and he shall deserve acquittal or convicted of a lesser
offence.
65. In cases falling in the first category, where no ingredient of the offence is
connected with or co-related to the Exception pleaded in defence, the Court shall have
to consider, on the basis of the total evidence on record, whether the prosecution has
or has not succeeded to establish beyond doubt the guilt of the accused and then to
consider whether there has been mitigation of the offence, or the accused deserves
being exonerated thereof on account of the Exception pleaded by him. If it be found
that the defence plea has not been proved, that is, the presumption of the absence of
circumstances under Sec. 105 of the Evidence Act has not been disproved, the Courts
of law would straight off record a finding of conviction. There would then be no
question re-assessing the evidence as a whole to decide whether all the ingredients of
the offence had been proved and the guilt established beyond doubt; but in cases
falling in the second category, the Court shall have to record, in the first instance, a
clear finding as to whether the ingredients other than the ingredient or ingredients
covered by the denfence plea have or have not been established beyond doubt. Once
the finding is recorded in favour of the prosecution, the Exception pleaded by the
accused shall be looked into whether the accused has succeeded in rebutting the
presumption by disproving the absence of the circumstances pleaded by him. If he
succeeds to disprove the absence of circumstances that is, to prove the defence plea,
he shall deserve acquittal or conviction of a lesser offence as there would be absence
of some of the ingredients of the main offence. In case the accused does not succeed
to repel the presumption under Sec. 105 of the Evidence Act, but does create a
reasonable doubt, the Court shall say that there exists a reasonable doubt as to the
ingredients connected with the defence plea and hence the offence as defined has not
been established and on this ground would acquit the accused or convict him of the
lesser offence.
66. Without expressing any final opinion the above can be clarified by giving an
example. I shall naturally give an example which can be said to be beyond any
controvesy. Sec. 499, I.P.C. defines "Defamation", while 'defamation' is punishable
under Sec. 500, I.P.C. Sec. 500, I.P.C. lays down that-
"Whoever defames another shall be punished
A person is said to defame
another when "by words either spoken or intended to be read, or by
??? or by visible representations makes or publishes any imputation concerning any
person intending to harm, or knowing or having reason to believe that such imputation
will harm, the reputation of such person." This is subject to the Exceptions detailed
thereafter. The First Exception is that "it is not defamation to impute anything which is
true concerning any person, if it be for the public good that the imputation should be
made or published."
67. The ingredients of Sec. 499, I.P.C. are the making or publishing of the
imputation; intending to harm, or knowing or having reason to believe that such
imputation shall harm, the reputation of such person. Where the accused pleads the
benefit of the First Exception, what he suggests is that the allegation made is true and
the imputation was made for the public good. The accused then does not challenge the
two ingredients of Sec. 499, that is, the making and the publication of the imputation
with the intention to harm the reputation of the other person. When the two facts
raised in defence are in no way connected with the main ingredients of Sec. 499,
I.P.C., the Court shall, first of all, have to record a finding whether the alleged
defamation has or has not been established beyond doubt and thereafter to consider
the defence plea. Protection is given to the accused person by the First Exception only
if the imputation is true. No protection exists where the defamatory statements are
not true, but may be true. When the benefit of the First Exception can be availed of
only when the imputations are true, it cannot be open to the accused to say that he
should be given the benefit of this Exception even when he is merely able to show that
there is some possibility of the imputations being true; to put it differently, the
imputations may be true or may not be true. When no question of reasonable doubt as
to the truth of imputations arises, the charge of defamation shall be fully established
where the ingredients of Sec. 499, I.P.C. are established beyond doubt and the
accused fails to establish the truth of the imputations. See Lalmohan Singh V. The
King21. This case would clearly fall in the first category where none of the ingredients
of the offence are connected with or co-related to the Exception pleaded by the
accused.
68. The offence of murder is defined in Sec. 300, I.P.C. This section by itself says
that-
"Except in the cases hereinafter excepted culpable homicide is murder, if the act by
which the death is caused is done with the intention of causing death, or
69. Every homicide is not murder. It is only culpable homicide which can amount to
murder. The word 'culpable' means criminal or blame-worthy. Consequently, the
intention or knowledge contemplated by Sec. 300, I.P.C. must be a criminal or guilty
one. Where it appears that the intention or knowledge is not criminal or illegal, the
causing of death cannot be said to be culpable and it shall not be 'culpable homicide',
that is, murder. In the circumstances, it must be held that the intention or knowledge
contemplated by Sec. 300, I.P.C. is a criminal or guilty intention or knowledge, and
not mere intention or knowledge. To make this point more clear it must be mentioned
that it is a well established rule that "unless the statute, either clearly or by necessary
implication, rules out mens rea as a constituent part of a crime, a defendant should
not be found guilty of an offence against the criminal law unless he has got a guilty
mind." Such observations made in Brent V. Wood were quoted with approval by their
Lordships of the Privy Council Srinivas Mall Bairoliya V. Emperor23 Consequently, the
ingredients of the offence under Sec. 300, I.P.C. are the doing of an act by which the
death is caused, and the doing of the act with the intention, that is, criminal intention
to cause death. Where the accused seeks the benefit of the General Exceptions
contained in Secs. 80 and 84, I.P.C., what he implies to mean is that he did not have
the guilty intention at the time he caused the death. Consequently,
at the initial stage the Court shall have to consider whether the prosecution has
established beyond doubt that the death of the person was caused by or is the result
of the act done by the accused. If so satisfied, the defence plea shall be looked into
whether the accused has succeeded to rebut the presumption, that is, to disprove the
absence of the circumstances contemplated by the above sections. Once the accused
succeeds in establishing his plea, he would deserve acquittal on account of there being
on guilty intention; it is a different thing that he may be liable to conviction of the
lesser offence; but if the accused is not successful in disproving the absence of
circumstances, the Court of law shall still have to see whether the ingredient of
criminal intention, that is, mens rea has been established by the prosecution beyond
reasonable doubt. It is then that a reasonable doubt created in the mind of the Court
as to the defence plea shall lead to the inference that the guilty intention has not been
established beyond reasonable doubt and on this ground the guilt of the accused as to
the main offence shall be deemed not to have been established beyond doubt and he
shall be acquitted. From the practical point of view the accused is being given the
benefit of the Exception pleaded by him; but, in the eye of law, the benefit of
reasonable doubt is of the ingredients of the offence, and not of the Exception pleaded
by him. The above case admittedly falls in the second category mentioned above.
70. The contention of the learned Advocate for the appellants that in view of Sec. 6
of the Penal Code, 1860 and Sec. 221 (5) of the Criminal Procedure Code all the
Exceptions, whether "General" or special are parts of the offence, and hence
ingredients thereof and they must be established beyond doubt by the prosecution,
has, in my opinion, no force. Sec. 6 merely lays down that every definition of an
offence shall be understood subject to General Exception even though not repeated in
such definition. The effect of Sec. 6 is to incorporate the General Exceptions in every
definition of an offence. For example, while reading Sec. 300, I.P.C. we shall have to
include therein not only the Exceptions 1 to 5 detailed therein, but also the General
Exceptions contained in Secs. 76 to 106, I.P.C. The offence would still be as defined in
the main part of Sec. 300, I.P.C. and the rest shall be Exceptions. If the burden of
proving the Exception is placed on the accused, it shall be necessary for him to
discharge this burden. Sec. 6 cannot thus affect the application of Sec. 105 of the
Evidence Act. In other words, Sec. 6 can be of no help in considering the scope of Sec.
105 of the Evidence Act.
71. Similarly, Sec. 221 (5) of the Criminal Procedure Code provides that:-
"The fact that the charge is made is equivalent to a statement that every legal
condition required by law to constitute the offence charged was fulfilled in the
particular case."
72. Illustration thereof is as below:
(a) A is charged with the murder of B. This is equivalent to a statement that A's
act fell within the definition of murden given in Secs. 299 and 300 of the Penal
Code, 1860; that it did not fall within any of the general exceptions of the same
Code; and that it did not fall within any of the five exceptions to Sec. 300, or
that, if it did fall within Exception I, one or other of the three provisos to that
exception apply to it."
73. Sec. 221(5), Cr. P.C. is a procedural clause and cannot affect the rights and
liabilities of the parties, non can it affect the burden of proof, that is, which party must
establish a particular fact or matter in issue. Apparently, this provision was
incorporated to make it clear that it is for the accused to plead the benefit of the
Exception, and if no such plea is raised, the Court shall assume that the Exception did
not exist, and on the main ingredients being established the accused can be convicted
of such offence.
74. The above contention was evidently repelled in the Full Bench case of Prabhoo
V. Emperor- lqbal Ahmad, C.J., expressed his opinion clearly by laying down that
none of the above sections had the effect of reducing the scope of Sec. 105 of
the Evidence Act and the burden of proof did lie on the accused.
75. My attention was also drawn to the fact that the Evidence Act was passed after
the Penal Code, 1860 and before the commencement of the Code of Criminal
Procedure. Each is a distinct law: Penal Code, 1860 laying down the criminal offences;
the Code of Criminal Procedure, the procedure to be followed in criminal trials; while
the Evidence Act, the evidence which can be adduced in any suit or proceeding and on
whom the burden of proof lies. When each statute covers a particular branch of the
law, it cannot over-ride the provisions of the other laws.
76. The nature and extent of the evidence necessary to establish the Exception or
proviso raised in defence has been considered in Dahyabhai Chhaganbhai Thakkar V.
State of Gujarat-, Harbhajan Singh V. Stat of Punjab and V.D. Jhingan V. State of
Uttar Pradesh It is thus a settled law that the burden of proof which lies on the
accused by virtue of the provisions of Sec. 105 of the Evidence Act is not as heavy as
on the prosecution to establish the guilt of the accused. The prosecution has to prove
its case beyond reasonable doubt, while the accused has simply to disprove the
absence of circumstances contemplated by the Exception, that is, to prove facts which
would entitle him to the benefit of the Exception. The test of probabilities is to be
applied in judging the defence plea. The accused has to establish his plea in the
manner a plaintiff or defendant shall prove his case in a civil proceeding. It is thus the
preponderance of probabilities which shall determine whether the defence plea has
been established and the case falls or does not fall within one of the Exceptions
contained in the Penal Code, 1860. When the three expressions mentioned above are
read together, there can be no difficulty in understanding the meaning of the term
"preponderance of probability". However, in view of the fact that the this question had
been raised at the Bar, it is necessary to make a few observations.
77. Our attention was drawn to the definition of "preponderance of evidence" as in
vogue in America. In American Jurisprudence, 2nd Edition, Valume 30, the expression
has been defined in Article 1164. In America the term means "the weight, credit and
value of the aggregate evidence on either side, and is usually considered to be
synonymous with the term greater weight of the evidence", or "greater weight of the
credible evidence". It is a phrase which, in the last analysis, means probability of the
truth. To be satisfied, certain, or convinced is a much higher test than the test of
"preponderance of evidence".
78. The pharase of "preponderance of probability" appears to have taken from
Charles H. Copper V. Fredk. Wm. Cleds24. The observations made therein make it clear
that what "preponderance of probability" means is "more probable and rational view of
the case", not necessarily as certain as the pleading should be.
79. On the basis of the definition of the words "proved", "disproved" and "not
proved", as contained in Sec. 3 of the Evidence Act, a similar inference can be drawn.
The term "proved" is defined as below:-
"A fact is said to be proved when, after considering the matters before it, the Court
either believes it to exist, or considers its existence so probable that a prudent man
ought, under the circumstances of the particular case, to act upon the supposition
that it exists."
80. When the evidence is of a overwhelming nature and is conclusive, there shall
exist no dispute, non shall there be any doubt and the Court can say that the fact does
exist; but in criminal trials, where the accused claims the benefit of the Exception
there cannot be any evidence of such a nature. Very often there is oral evidence which
may be equally balance. In the circumstances, the case of the prosecution or of the
defence has to be accepted or rejected on the basis of probabilities. Sec. 3 of the
Evidence Act by itself lays down that a fact is said to be proved when, after
considering the matters before it, the Court
considers its existence so probable that a prudent man ought, under the
circumstances of the particular case, to act upon the supposition that it exists. This is
what is meant by the "test of probabilities" or the "preponderance of probabilities".
The decision is taken as in a civil proceeding.
81. To avoid repetition it can here be mentioned that the law with regard to the
discharge of burden of proof by the prosecution, or by the defence against whom a
presumption can be drawn under Sec. 105 of the Evidence Act, is as detailed in K.M.
Nanavati V. State of Maharashtra5, and whether the accused has been able to
discharge the burden of proof is to be judged on the basis of the "test of probabilities"
or the "preponderance of probabilities" in the same manner as the Court records a
finding in a civil proceeding. This rule applies to the accused. A more rigorous proof is
called for from the prosecution which must establish its case beyond reasonable doubt.
82. The next point for consideration is to what extent the above rule laid down by
the Supreme Court in case in which the benefit of Secs. 80 and 84, I.P.C. is claimed,
can be applied to cases in which the accused claims the benefit of other Exceptions, all
the more, where a plea of private defence has been raised. The Evidence Act is a
complete Code and its purpose is to consolidate, define and amend the law of
Evidence. Consequently, the provisions of this Act shall govern all the judicial
proceedings in or before any Court. The Evidence Act applies equally to civil and
criminal cases. It may, however, be mentioned that in the Evidence Act there are
certain provisions applicable exclusively to civil proceedings and a few others to
criminal trial only; but speaking broadly, it can be laid down that the Evidence Act
applies equally to both the civil and criminal proceedings. Further, there shall be no
justification to depart from the express provisions contained in the Evidence Act. Such
provisions shall govern the recording of evidence and also the question of the burden
of proof. We cannot look into the English practice or the law prevalent in our country in
the past on the ground of public policy or the interest of justice. To put it differently,
the provisions of the Evidence Act must be strictly construed even though such a step
may not conform with the ideas of the Court or may appear to be unjust or may cause
hardship to the accused. See The Governor and Company of the Bank of England V.
Vazlians Brothers25 and Norendra Nath Sircar V. Kamalbasini Dasi26
83. Sec. 105 of the Evidence Act has been worded in clear and unambiguous terms
and it shall apply to each and every case where the benefit of the General Exceptions,
or the special Exceptions or provisos contained in the Penal Code, 1860, or in any
other law is claimed. Sec. 105 reads as below:-
"when a person is accused of any offence, the burden of proving the existence of
circumstances bringing the case within any of the General Exceptions in the Penal
Code, 1860 or within any special exception or proviso contained in any other part of
the same Code, or in any law defining the offence, is upon him, and the Court shall
presume the absence of such circumstances."
84. The term "shall presume" has been defined in Sec. 4 of the Evidence Act and
means that the Court "shall regard the fact as proved unless and until it is disproved."
Reading Sec. 105 of the Evidence Act with the definition of the term "shall presume"
as contained in Sec. 4, it must be held that where the existence of circumstances
bringing the case within the Exception is pleaded or is raised, the Court shall presume
the absence of such circumstances unless and until it is disproved. "Disproved" is
different to "not proved". In Sec. 3 the meaning of the terms "proved" and "disproved"
have been given and the term "not proved" is defined "neither proved nor disproved".
Consequently, if the accused is unable to disprove the absence of circumstances, that
is, prove the existence of the circumstances, the case would fall in the category of "not
proved" and, in the eye of law, the burden imposed by Sec. 105 shall not stand
discharged. In other words, the accused has to prove the existence of the
circumstances bringing the case within the Exception and he shall be deemed to have
discharged the burden of proof only when the Court considers the existence so
probable that a prudent man ought, under the circumstances of the particular case, to
act upon the supposition that it exists. In other words, no question of the benefit of
doubt arises while the Court is considering the question of the existence of
circumstances bringing the case within the Exception. On the basis of doubt the
contention can be rejected or the case of the party not accepted; but to accept a case
not free from doubts, that is, to accept a doubtful case, is not warranted by the
Evidence Act. In this view of the matter the accused can be deemed to have
discharged the burden of proof only when he is in a position to disprove the absence of
circumstances, that is, is able to discharge the onus in the manner the plaintiff or the
defendant must in a civil proceeding. It would be a wrong proposition of law to say
that in criminal trials where there exists a reasonable doubt in the mind of the Court,
the Exception pleaded be deemed to have been proved. Sec. 105 of the Evidence Act
makes no difference between the Exceptions or provisos contained in one enactment
or the other. In the circumstances, the rule applicable to the General Exceptions under
Secs. 80 and 84, I.P.C. shall apply with equal force to the other General Exceptions
contained in the Penal Code, 1860 or the special exceptions or proviso contained in
this Code or in other enactments.
85. Two other points raised on behalf of the appellants may now be considered. It
was argued that the term "may presume" shall have the same meaning as "shall
presume" in case the Court decides to presume the existence of a fact. The suggestion
thus made is that it is discretionary with the Court to presume or not to presume and
once the Court decides to presume the existence of a fact, the same rule shall apply as
in a case where there is a statutory clause to presume the existence of the fact.
Reliance was placed upon the case of Otto George Ofeller V. The King where mere
giving of a reasonable or plausible explanation was held to be sufficient to discharge
the burden of proof. The definition of "may presume" and "shall presume", as
contained in Sec. 4 of the Evidence Act, makes it clear that the discretionary
presumption where the words "may presume" have been used is much weaker than in
a case where the provision directs the Court to presume the existence of a fact. In
case of a weaker presumption, mere explanation can be sufficient and such strong
evidence is not needed as in a case where the Court must presume the existence of a
fact. The above contention was raised in Dhanvantrai Balwantrai Desai V. State of
MaharashtraÂ¹2 and C.S.D. Swami V. The State4 but was repelled on the ground that the
burden resting on the accused in a case under the Prevention of Corruption Act where
the word "shall" had been used was not as light as it was where the presumption was
raised under Sec. 114 of the Evidence Act, and could be held to be discharged merely
by reason of the fact that the explanation offered by the accused was reasonable and
probable. It was held that the presumption under the Prevention of Corruption Act
must be rebutted by "proof" and not by a bare explanation which was merely
plausible.
86. The second point raized is that in criminal trials more convincing evidence is
expected from the prosecution before the accused can be held guilty of the charge,
and this is a departure from the ordinary meaning of "proved" as contained in Sec. 3
of the Evidence Act. It was thus contended that in criminal trials while judging the
defence plea similar leniency can be shown to the accused. The suggestion made is
that where the evidence is equally balanced and the Court thinks that the defence plea
may or may not be true, a prudent person contemplated by Sec. 3 of the Evidence Act
must act on the supposition that the fact exists. What is suggested is that the benefit
of the reasonable possibility of truth of the defence plea be utilized
to hold that the absence of circumstances contemplated by Sec. 105 of the Evidence
Act has been disproved. It is true that the maxim, applicable in India as in England,
that an accused shall be presumed to be innocent and the prosecution must establish
its case beyond reasonable doubt is a departure from the ordinary meaning of the
term "proved" as contained in Sec. 3 of the Evidence Act. It is, however, a rule of
caution and prudence laid down by the Courts of law how a prudent man must, in a
criminal case, assess the evidence adduced by the prosecution. In the words used in
Sec. 3 of the Evidence Act, the prosecution case is not deemed to have been 'proved',
that is, is deemed to be 'not proved', even though in a civil proceeding the fact could,
on the basis of such evidence, be deemed to have been 'proved'; and the effect of the
above maxim is to regard a fact "not proved", though in civil proceeding it could be
deemed to be "proved." The same can not, however, be laid down for a provision
where one has to consider whether the absence of circumstances had been disproved,
or the existence of the cirsumstances had been proved. On the application of a
rigorous rule, the Court can hold that the existence of circumstances had not been
proved, or the absence of circumstances had not been disproved; but to say that the
existence of circumstances shall be deemed to have been proved or the absence of
circumstances disproved shall not be correct, for the simple reason that on the basis of
doubt, the fact is to be disbelieved, and not believed. I am, therefore, not inclined to
agree with the proposition that on a reasonable doubt being created, a prudent man
should proceed with the assumption that the existence of circumstances had been
proved.
87. Sec. 105 of the Evidence Act, therefore, applies to each and every Exception or
proviso contained in any enactment and hence shall apply even when the accused
pleads the benefit of the "General Exception" contained in Sec. 96, I.P.C., that is,
pleads to have acted in the exercise of the right of private defence of his person or
property. In the circumstances, the rule laid down by the Supreme Court in cases
where the benefit of Secs. 80 and 84, I.P.C. had been claimed can be applied with
equal force to a case where the accused pleads the benefit of Sec. 96, I.P.C. The
application of this rule to a case where the accused person has pleaded the benefit of
Sec. 96, I.P.C. shall not cause any hardship to him, as in such a case the burden shall
lie on the prosecution till the end of the trial to prove all the ingredients of the offence
beyond any reasonable doubt. When the accused raises the plea contained in Secs. 80
and 84, I.P.C. what he contends is that he did not have the criminal intention or
knowledge contemplated by the definition of the "offence". The same can be said when
the plea of private defence is raised. Sec. 80, I.P.C. provides:
"Nothing is an offence which is done by accident or misfortune, and without any
criminal intention or knowledge in the doing of a lawful act in a lawful manner by
lawful means and with proper care and caution."
88. Criminal intention or knowledge is a material ingredient of Sec. 80 the other
ingredients being that the act should be lawful and was done in a lawful manner by
lawful means and with proper care and caution.
89. Similarly, Sec. 84, I.P.C. provides:-
"Nothing is an offence which is done by a person who, at the time of doing it by
reason of unsoundness of mind, is in capable of knowing the nature of the act or
that he is doing what is either wrong or contrary to law."
90. A person incapable of knowing the nature of the act is a person who cannot be
deemed to have guilty knowledge or intention.
91. The plea contemplated by Secs. 80 and 84, I.P.C. directly affects one of the
ingredients of the offence, namely, the mens rea. The same can be said of the plea
contemplated by Sec. 96, I.P.C.
92. Sec. 96, I.P.C. provides:
"Nothing is an offence which is done in the exercise of the right of private defence".
93. The subsequent sections detail such right. Sec. 97 provides that every person
has a right, subject to the restrictions contained in Sec. 99, to defend not only his
person and property but also the person or property of others.
94. When an accused person acts in the exercise of the right of private defence,
what is meant is that even though armed he had no prior intention to commit an
offence and whatever he did was in the exercise of the rights given to him under he
law. His act would thus not be illegal and, in the eye of law, the act cannot be deemed
to have been done with a criminal or guilty intention or knowledge which is invariably
the most important ingredient of a criminal offence.
95. At the very start of the argument the earned Advocate for the appellants had
cited three illustrations where injustice shall be done to the accused if the benefit of
the Exception, as contemplated by the dictum under reference, was not given to he
accused. It was said that where there was a dispute as to possession of property
between A and B, and such disputes were followed by a marpit in which both the
parties were injured, it shall be necessary to convict both the parties where the
possession of either was doubtful, considering that none of the parties shall be able to
discharge the burden of proof as contemplated by Sec. 105 of the Evidence Act. The
suggestion thus made is that one party or the other must have been in possession and
the conviction of the party in possession shall be against equity and conscience. Where
the possession is in dispute there can be two kinds of cases: the property belonged to
a third person and parties A and B start laying claim thereto, or that A is in possession
and B raises a claim to the property at the same time asserting that he was in
possession. In the first case both he parties can be deemed to have the guilty
intention and they can be convicted or the acts done by them. It would be a case of
free fight or in suitable circumstances a case of sudden fight. See Jumman. The State
of Punjab- In the other case, one party alone shall be convicted and the other given
the benefit of the General Exception contained in Sec. 96, I.P.C., that is, of private
defence, provided that the evidence adduced by the party in possession is acceptable;
but where the evidence is sufficient to hold that the possession had been proved, the
Courts of law shall hold that the burden of proof contemplated by Sec. 105 the
Evidence Act had not been discharged by both the parties. However, while deciding
whether mens rea, one of the important ingredients of the offence, has or has not
been established beyond doubt, the Courts of law can grant the benefit of doubt to
both the parties, or convict one party and give the benefit of doubt to the other. In
such a case what, according to the learned Advocate, should be done by assuming the
existence of circumstances shall be by holding that all the ingredients of the offence
had not been established beyond doubt.
96. The other two illustrations pertain to those cases where there is a dispute as to
where the marpit took place, or who started the marpit. The principles indicated above
while making comments on the first illustration shall apply with equal force to these
illustrations also. In other words, the accused person shall not be convicted simply
because the dictum under reference shall not be followed and instead the law as laid
down by the Supreme Court shall be made applicable.
97. Reference may now be made to the English decisions and the decisions of the
High Courts in India to which our attention has been drawn. Woolmington V. The
Director of Public Prosecutions14 has been the foundation of decisions not only by the
Courts in England but also in India. This case and also R. V. Carr. Braint1 were
considered by the Supreme Court in some of the decisions referred to above. The rule
of law laid down in Woolmington V. The Director of Public Prosecutions14 has been
reproduced in Halsbury's Laws of England. In the circumstances, it is not necessary to
make further comments on these three cases.
98. The rule enunciated by Viscount Sankey, L.C. in Woolmington V. The Director
of Public Prosecutions14 was relied upon in Mancini V. Director of Public Prosecutions.
The King V. Kekelo28 is a case where onus lay on the accused to prove that he was not
an alien, and not upon the prosecution to prove that he was. This case cannot be of
any help considering that therein the prosecution had itself adduced sufficient
evidence to prove that the accused was an alien.
99. It was strongly argued on behalf of the State that the majority decision in
Prabhoo V. Emperor1 was conrarty to the decisions of the Supreme Court and can no
longer be regarded as a good law. I have carefully gone through the judgments of
Iqbal Ahmad, C.J., and Collister, J., which can be regarded as the leading judgments
of the majority and minority Judges and find that Iqbal Ahmad, C.J., had laid down
the law correctly, though a mistake was committed while giving the answer to the
question referred to the Full Bench. The answer was given in the form of a dictum
which has been referred to us for consideration. If the dictum is not given unnecessary
weight, it shall be found that the majority view is in consonance with the recent
Supreme Court decisions. The minority view shall be contrary to the law laid down by
the Supreme Court.
100. QQAL AHMAD, C.J., has laid down not at one place but many that the
reasonable doubt is as to the guilt of the accused, and not to the existence of the
Exception. At page 407 he observed as below:-
"It would thus appear that there is formidable weight of authority in support of the
view that in cases falling within the purview of Sec. 105, Evidence Act, the evidence
produced by the accused person, even though falling short of proving affirmatively
the existence of circumstances bringing the case within the exception pleaded by
him, can be utilized as part of the entire evidence in the case for the purpose of
showing that a reasonable doubt exists as to his guilt."
101. Other observations made by Iqbal Ahmad, C.J., are as below:-
"It is on the basis of these principles that it is well settled in England that the
evidence against the accused must be such as to exclude, to a moral certainty,
every reasonable doubt about his guilt and if there be any reasonable doubt about
his guilt he is entitled to be acquitted.
What holds good in
England must hold good in India."
"The burden of proving the existence of circumstances bringing the case within the
"exception" or "proviso" is no doubt cast on the accused by Sec. 105, but this does
not in any way absolve the prosecution of the burden laid on it by Sec. 102. The
burden of proof, so far as the entire "proceeding" is concerned, remains on the
prosecution, even though the burden of the "fact in issue" pleaded by the accused
is cast upon him by Sec. 105.
There is, however, nothing in the Evidence Act to indicate that the failure of the
accused to discharge the burden lightens the burden placed on the prosecution by
Sec. 102
and "the onus never changes". It is,
therefore, manifest that even in cases to which Sec. 105 applies the prosecution
has to prove the guilt of the accused."
"Should it in the consideration of the question whether A is guilty of murden put
aside the evidence produced by A, ??? to say, in a watertight compartment and
exclude that evidence entirely from con sideration? or should it take that evidence
for what it is worth into consideration along with the other evidence in the case and
then make up its mind as to the guild or innocence of A? I cannot but hole that it is
only the latter alternative which is open to the Court and this is what follows from
the definition of "proved" in the Act. It is one thing to hold that the "exception" or
"proviso" pleaded has not been proved and it is quite another thing to say that it
has been disproved. If a reasonable
doubt as to the existence of the exception or proviso exists the Court cannot, while
considering the evidence as a whole, deny to the accused the benefit of that doubt."
102. COLLISTER, J. personally preferred the law as enunciated by Viscount Sankey
in Woolmington's case, and saw no reason why the law in India as regard this branch
of burden of proof should differ from the law in England, but he regarded it as his duty
to interpret the law as it was. He summed up the legal position in the following words:
"Upon a careful examination of the relevant sections of the Evidence Act I find
myself forced to the conclusion that at the termination of the trial the accused
person will not be entitled to the benefit of Sec. 96, Penal Code, unless upon a
review of all the evidence the Court is either satisfied as to the existence of the
circumstances pleaded or considers the fact of their existence to be probable that a
prudent man ought under the circumstances of the particular case to act upon the
supposition that they existed."
103. COLLISTER, J. repelled the contention that notwithstanding the specific
provisions of the Evidence Act relating to exceptions, the Court must acquit an
accused person if it entertained reasonable doubt as regards his guilt. At another place
he expressed a similar opinion by laying down the general onus on the prosecution
was subject by statute to the special onus which Sec. 105 imposed on the accused
person and that the Court would not be justified in falling back on the general
principle that the Crown must prove the prisoner's guilt in view of the specific
provisions contained in Sec. 105. In Prabhoo's1 case reference to the Full Bench was
made by Braund, J., and he expressed the question referred to the Full Bench in the
following words:-
"The question before this Full Bench is whether, in such a situation, the Court is
bound to reject the plea of the exception, or whether it still remains open to it, on
looking at the evidence as a whole (including the evidence of self defence) to give
to the accused the benefit of any reasonable doubt that remains whether the act
may not have been committed in self defence."
104. The judgment of Collister, J. all the more, when read with that of Braund, J.,
makes it clear that the minority Judges were of opinion that once the defence story of
self defence was rejected, that is, plea of the exception was not accepted, the Court
cannot, looking at the evidence as a whole, including the evidence of self defence, give
to the accused the benefit of any reasonable doubt as to the guilt on the ground that
the accused had acted in self defence.
105. The Supreme Court has clearly laid down that even after the rejection of the
defence plea the general onus remains on the prosecution and if there exists any
reasonable doubt as to the guilt, its benefit shall go to the accused and he shall be
entitled to acquittal even though he had failed to discharge the burden of proof placed
upon him under Sec. 105. It shall thus appear that the majority, judgment in
Prabhoo's1 case expresses the law correctly, though the reply to the question referred
to the Full Bench was not expressed in correct legal words.
106. TO avoid unnecessary repetition later it may be added that the minority
judgment in Prabhoo's1 stands over-ruled by the Supreme Court decision in Dahyabhai
Chhaganbhai Thakkar V. State of Gujarat- While discussing the case of Ram Hit Ram
V. The State of Madhya Pradesh13, their Lordships made it clear that they did not agree
with the view expressed therein, namely, that the benefit of doubt which the law gives
on the assumption of innocence is available only where the prosecution has not been
able to connect the accused with the occurrence and it has nothing to do with the
mental state of the accused. In other words, even if the accused is unable to
substantiate the defence plea, the Court has to see whether the guilty intention or
knowledge which is a material ingredient of the offence has or has not been proved
beyond reasonable doubt.
107. In Jadeja Danubha Vanubha V. State2 and State V. Bhima Devraj30 the view
expressed in the Full Bench case of Govt. of Bombay V. Sakur31 was adopted. Macklin,
J. observed in this Bombay case that "the practical difference between English and
Indian law as to the proof of exceptions is not very great; in the result it is often no
more than a matter of words" However certain observations made suggest that in a
case of murden the prosecution has merely to prove that the accused caused the death
and thereafter the burden lies upon the accused to prove the existence of
circumstances bringing his case within the exception relating to the right of private
defence and if he fails to discharge this onus, the Court shall presume the absence of
such circumstances and can convict the accused. At another place it was observed that
in the eye of law, the standard of "proof" required from both the prosecution and the
accused is the same, though in practice the standard of "proof" required to bring a
case within one of the exceptions is lower than the standard of proof required from the
prosecution to establish its own case. It was further observed that this was because a
"prudent man might well consider it his duty to act upon circumstances in the one
case which he might not consider to be a justification for action in the other case." It
was held that the jury should not be told that the accused should prove his case
beyond reasonable doubt or that the burden on him is necessarily less than the burden
on the prosecution. These observations are clearly against the Supreme Court
decisions and I may say with respect do not lay down the law correctly. It is true that
in view of the definition of "proof" as contained in Sec. 3 of the Evidence Act, the proof
expected from both the prosecution and the accused is the same which would be,
what a prudent man considers sufficient in the circumstances of the case; but in view
of the presumption of the innocence of the accused, it is necessary for the prosecution
to establish its case beyond reasonable doubt, while the accused has to establish his
case in the manner a plaintiff or defendant has to make out his case in a civil
proceeding. Further, there are not always two questions involved, "the proof of the
case for the prosecution and the proof of the exception put forward by the defence.
They are also not two separate questions to be decided separately," the second
question arising after the first has been decided. This rule can be applied to only those
cases which fall in the first category, and not those which fall in the second category
detailed above. The Bombay case is more or less on the lines of the minority judgment
in
Prabhoo's1 case and cannot be said to correctly express the law.
108. The above Full Bench case was followed by the same High Court in Har Prasad
Ghasi Ram Gupta V. State32. No further comments are therefore, necessary.
109. The observations of Mitter, J. in Yusuf Sk. V. The State33 that the "question of
an onus under Sec. 105 only arises after the prosecution has established the
commission of an offence" and that the "standard of proof under Sec. 105, Evidence
Act is the same as the standard which is required of the prosecution in a criminal
trial," are clearly against the Supreme Court decisions. The first observation may
however, apply to a case falling in the first category.
110. In Re. Gampla Subbigadu alias Damasagadu it was observed that in the
absence of proof of the plea of self defence it was not possible for the court to presume
the truth of the plea of self defence. It was further observed that it was not possible to
reject the prosecution evidence merely because the prosecution witnesses did not
explain how the accused himself came by his injuries. The Report suggests that the
accused cannot be acquitted after giving the benefit of reasonable doubt created as to
his guilt on the plea of private defence raised by him not being accepted.
This is clearly against the law laid down by the Supreme Court.
111. In Baswantrao Bajirao V. Emperor35, it was observed that:-
"the accused is not entitled to any benefit of the doubt as to his insanity because
the burden is on him to prove strictly that he committed the act in a moment of
insanity."
112. This can no longer be treated as a correct law, the Supreme Court having
decided to the contrary, namely, that if any reasonable doubt is created as to mens
rea, the benefit of doubt shall go to the accused by holding that the charge had not
been established beyond doubt.
113. In the State V. Chhotelal Gangadin Gadariaya3 the earlier decision of the
Court in Ramhit Ram V. The State of Madhya Pradesh13 was followed; but as already
mentioned above, the case of Ramhit Ram13 has been over-ruled by the Supreme
Court.
114. Though not so expressed Prabhoo's1 case appears to have been followed in
Bala Prasad Dhansukh V. State of Madhya PradeshÂ³7. I am drawing this inference from
the following observations made in Para. 21 of the Report.
"In all such cases, as soon as such evidence is introduced, which, if believed, would
establish the circumstances on which the defence may rely to bring his case under
any of the exceptions, etc., the burden of the accused is discharged. It is equally
discharged when on a consideration of the whole of the evidence the Court is left in
doubt as to whether the killing may have been under the circumstances disclosed in
the evidence on record."
115. Prabhoo's1 case was followed in Kamla Singh V. The State38 and it was
observed that the onus under Sec. 105 was discharged or could be taken as
discharged once "the Court is brought to a point where it becomes doubtful of the fact
of when it cannot positively hold that the prisoner was then not of unsound mind and
that he was capable of knowing the nature of the act alleged against him." For reasons
already indicated above, this is not a correct approach, though the accused, can be
given the benefit of reasonable doubt as to his guilt. In other words, the Court can
hold that the prosecution has not succeeded to establish its case beyond reasonable
doubt.
116. In Etwa Oraon V. The State39 the earlier case of Kamla Singh V. The State38
was not dissented from. It was observed that:-
"The burden is discharged if the defence establishes facts and circumstances which
might lead to a reasonable inference that at the time of the commission of the
offence the accused was of unsound mind, the unsoundness of his mind being of
the nature or extent mentioned in Sec. 84 Penal Code, 1860."
117. Reasonable infernece is not the same thing as reasonable doubt. It cannot
also amount to 'proof' as contemplated by Sec. 3 of the Evidence Act. The above
observations are to some extent against the view expressed by the Supreme Court.
118. Brindaban Prasad V. The State4 is based upon the Supreme Court decision in
the case of K.M. Nanawati V. State of Maharashtra5 and needs no further comments.
119. Prabhoo's case was not followed in V. Ambi V. State of Kerala41, and it was
held that the accused would be entitled to acquittal on the ground of insanity only
if
there was a probability of the accused being legally insane at the time of the
commission of the crime. In case it was meant to lay down that the accused could not
be given the benefit of reasonable doubt as to all or some of the ingredients of the
offence, it would not be a correct exposition of law
120. To sum up, the doctrine of the burden of proof and the nature of evidence
necessary to discharge this burden, in cases where the accused claims the benefit of
the
general Exceptions in the Penal Code, 1860 or of any special exception or proviso
contained in any other part of the same Code, or in any other law, can be stated as
below: -
1. The case shall fall in one of the three categories depending upon the wording of
the enactment: -
(i) The statute places the burden of proof of all or some of the ingredients of the
offence on the accused himself;
(ii) the special burden placed on the accused does not touch the ingredients of
the offence but only the protection given on the assumption of the proof of the
said ingredients; and
(iii) the special burden relates to an exception some of the many circumstances
required to attract the exception, if proved, affecting the proof of all or some
of the ingredients of the offence.
2. In the first two categories the onus lies upon the accused to discharge the
special burden. and on failure he can be convicted of the offence provided that
the prosecution has succeeded to discharge its general burden of proof, that is,
to establish the case beyond any reasonable doubt.
3. In cases falling under the third category inability to discharge the burden of proof
shall not, in each and every case, automatically result in the conviction of the
accused. The Court shall still have to see how the facts proved affect the proof of
the ingredients of the offence. In other words, if on consideration of the total
evidence on record a reasonable doubt exists in the mind of the Court as regards
one or more of the ingredients of the offence, including mens rea of the accused,
he shall be entitled to its benefit and hence to acquittal of the main offence even
though he had not been in a position to prove the circumstances to bring his
case within the exception. This shall be on the ground that the general burden of
proof resting on the prosecution was not discharged.
4. The burden of proof on the prosecution to establish its case rests from the
beginning to the end of the trial and it must prove beyond reasonable doubt that
the accused had committed the offence with the requisite mens rea.
5. The burden placed on the accused is not so onerous as on the prosecution. The
prosecution has to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt, but in determining
whether the accused has been successful in discharging the onus, the Court shall
look into the preponderance of probabilities in the same manner as in a civil
proceeding. In other words, the Court shall have to see whether a prudent man
would, in the circumstances of the case, act on the supposition that the case falls
within the exception or proviso as pleaded by the accused.
121. In this view of the matter the dictum laid down in Prabhoo V. Emperor1 is
partly erroenous and requires modification, though the decision, read as a whole is in
conformity with the law. The dictum can be modified as below:-
In a case in which any General Exception in the Penal Code, 1860, or any special
exception or proviso contained in another part of the same Code, or in any law
defining the offence, is pleaded or raised by an accused person and the evidence
led in support of such plea, judged by the test of the preponderance of probability,
as in a civil proceeding, fails to displace the presumption arising from Sec. 105 of
the Evidence Act, in other words, to disprove the absence of circumstances bringing
the case within the said exception; but upon a consideration of the evidence as a
whole, including the evidence given in support of the plea based on the said
exception or proviso, a reasonable doubt is created in the mind of the Court, as
regards one or more of the ingredients of the offence, the accused person shall be
entitled to the benefit of the reasonable doubt as to his guilt and hence to acquittal
of the said offence.
122. GYANENDRA KUMAR and YASHODA NANDAN, JJ.: - We have had the advantage
of reading the judgment jointly prepared by Broome, Gupta and Parekh, JJ. as well as
the separate judgments of Oak, C.J., Mathur, J. and Beg, J. Concurring with these
learned Judges, we find ourselves in
respectful disagreement with the view taken by Oak, C.J. that in a case where an
accused pleads that he had caused grievous hurt to the complainant in the exercise of
his right of private defence of property but succeeds only in creating a reasonable
doubt about his claim of being in possession over the field in question, he will be liable
to conviction. We also respectfully concur in the view taken by Broome, Gupta, Beg
and Parekh, JJ. that the dictum laid down by the majority of Judges in Prabhoo's1 case
is fundamentally correct and calls for a mere elucidation. In our opinion, there is no
conflict between the decisions of the Supreme Court and Prabhoo's case and we agree
that the question referred to this Full Bench should be answered in the affirmative.
123. We now proceed to give our own reasons for coming to this conclusion. The
question that has been engaging the attention of this Full Bench loses much of its
complexity, if it be clearly borne in mind that the task before a court administering
criminal justice is to determine whether a crime has been committed and, if so,
whether the responsibility for it can be fastened on the accused. Before the court
proceeds to consider the responsibility or otherwise of the accused, it has to determine
as to whether a crime has been committed at all. The burden of proving beyond
reasonable doubt that a crime has been committed and that the accused is responsible
for it rests upon the prosecution.
124. Crime may be described as an act or omission prohibited by law and made
punishable by it. In this sense not every act of killing is a crime. To cite some
examples of killing which are not forbidden by law but are in fact permitted by it, we
may take a case where the killing is by way of execution of a prisonen sentenced to
death by a court competest to do so by the executioner appointed by lawful authority
for that purpose. In cases of such homicides, which have sometime been described as
"justifiable homicide", no crime can be said to have been committed and consequently
no one can be found guilty for its commission. Likewise a case in which the accused
pleads having committed homicide in the exercise of right of his private defence of
person or property and also successfully establishes his claim, would, in our opinion,
fall in the same class. A person who kills another in order to save his own life cannot
be said to have committed an act prohibited by law or a crime. If an accused claims
protection of the Exception mentioned in Sec. 96 of the Penal Code, 1860 and fails to
establish affirmatively by preponderance of probabilities that he had acted in exercise
of the right claimed, but the evidence on record, taken as a whole, creates a doubt
that the claim made by the accused might reasonably be true, than the matter
becomes doubtful whether an unlawful homicide has taken place at all. In such a case
a corresponding doubt is created as to whether an act prohibited by law has been
committed and consequently the accused cannot be found guilty of a crime which
remains in the region of doubt. He will, in spite of his having failed to discharge the
burden placed on him by Sec. 105 of the Evidence Act, be entitled to the benefit of
doubt and acquittal.
125. In a case where the accused claims to have committed homicide in the
exercise his right of private defence either of person or of property and fails to satisfy
the Court affirmatively that he had such a right but only succeeds in creating a
reasonable doubt regarding the correctness of his claim, it is not, in our opinion, quite
accurate to say that one of the ingredients of the offence of culpable homicide, as
defined in Sec. 299 of the Penal Code, 1860, or the mens rea is wanting. The offence
of culpable homicide is fully defined in Sec. 299 and the mens rea necessary for the
offence are also expressly enumerated in the section itself. There are three species of
mens rea in Sec. 299 of the Penal Code, 1860: (1) An intention to cause death; (2) an
intention to cause bodily injury likely to cause death: (3) knowledge that death is
likely to be caused. When an accused has killed another to
protect his own life, he did have the intention to kill. In fact in most cases it is not
denied by him that he had the requisite intention or knowledge. He merely claims that
he was motivated by the desire to save his own life. To equate motive with mens rea
would result in a confusion of legal concepts. "Mens rea" has been defined by Glanville
Williams in his "Criminal Law, The General Part Second Edition" as follows:
"What, then, does the legal mens rea means. It refers to the mental element
necessary for particular crime and this mental element may be either intention to
do the immediate act or bring about the consequence or (in some crime)
recklessness as to such act or consequence."
126. In this sense of the expression, when a person commits homicide in exercise
of the right of private defence either of property or of person, the element of mens rea
contemplated by Sec. 299 of the Penal Code, 1860 is undoubtedly present. Thus
where a reasonable doubt is created with regard to the claim of an accused to the
protection of the Exception provided for by Sec. 96 of the Penal Code, 1860, the
accused becomes entitled, in our opinion, to the benefit of doubt and acquittal not
because an ingredient of the offence under Sec. 299 of the Penal Code, 1860 or its
mens rea become doubtful, but because a doubt is created as to whether the act
attributed to him amounts to a crime at all. We find support for the view we are taking
from the following passages from Russell on Crime, XI Edition:
"The new conception that merely to bring about a prohibited harm should not
involve a man in liability to punishment unless in addition he could be regarded as
morally blame-worthy came to be enshrined in the well known maxim actus non
facit reum nisi mens sit rea. This ancient maxim has remained unchallenged as a
declaration of principle at common law throughout the centuries up to the present
day. So long therefore as it remains unchallenged no man should be convicted of
crime at common law unless the two requirements which it envisages are satisfied,
namely, that there must be both a physical clement and a mental element in every
crime
A clear analysis of the requirements of law for the establishment of criminal liability
demands a term which indicates the physical element alone, entirely distinct from
that mental element which the old maxim so sharply set in opposition to it. For this
purpose lawyers have for some time been in the habit of employing the expression
actus reus thus using the adjective reus to qualify the noun actus in the same way
as the maxim used it (in the feminine form), to qualify the noun mens in both cases
then it means "legally prohibited" or "legally reprobated". Thus it is logically
possible and correct to advance the legal proposition that for criminal liability at
common law there must be not only an actus reus but also a mens rea, each
distinct from the other
On this footing the word actus carries only a factual significance, i.e. that a human
deed has been effected. The addition of the word reus carries the further
significance that in the factual circumstances of the deed there is a situation which
the law has forbidden to be brought about. To have killed a man is, without more,
an actus of no precise legal kind; it is a "homicide" and we do not yet know for
certain if the law has forbidden that particular killing. If however there is for
example evidence that the killing was the execution of a condemned prisoner by the
legally
appointed executioner, then it is an actus which the law, far from forbidding, has
indeed commanded, and therefore it is not an actus reus; and it is described as a
"justifiable homicide", a homicide in accordance with, and not against the law.. Again
if the death had been caused by a surgeon in the course of an operation which was
recognised by him and by the medical profession in general to be dangerous (in the
sense that it was medically advisable to risk the known chance that even when
conducted with the best of skill and care it might cause the patient's death), this will
be a risk which the law does not forbid to be taken but permits to be taken, and the
killing will not be an actus reus
However harmful or painful an event may be it is not an actus reus unless the law
in the particular circumstances of the case has forbidden it to be brought about. The
duly appointed executioner who has put to death a convicted criminal in accordance
with his sentence has killed a man with deliberate intent so to do, but he has
committed no crime because the deed was not prohibited, but was actually
commanded, by the law; again, the use in certain circumstances of even deadly
force by any citizen in the prevention of the commission of a crime by another
person, or in the arrest of one who has committed a felony, does not give rise to
criminal liability. Similarly the law does not prohibit a limited chastisement of a
child by a parent or schoolmaster, non the causing of hurt in the source of many
sports and games or in the performance of a surgical operation by one duly
qualified. That the deed was not prohibited by law is a complete defence for the
man who had done that deed, for although the actus was his, yet in the special
circumstances of his case it was not reus."
127. To our mind there is nothing in Sec. 105 of the Indian Evidence Act or Sec. 4
thereof which runs counter to the view expressed above.
128. The Supreme Court in K.M. Nanavati V. State of Maharashtra5 while
considering the question of burden of proof resting on the accused, has laid down
three different categories: (1) A statute may throw the burden of proof of all or some
of the ingredients of an offence on the accused: (2) The special burden may not touch
the ingredients of the offence but only the protection given on the assumption of the
proof of the said ingredients (see Secs. 77, 78, 79, 81 and 88 of the Penal Code,
1860). (3) It may relate to an exception, some of the many circumstances required to
attract the exception if proved affecting the proof of all or some of the ingredients of
the offence: (See Sec. 80 of the Penal Code, 1860)"
129. We are not concerned with the first category of cases. With regard to the third
category of cases, the Supreme Court has held that though the burden lies on the
accused to bring his case within the Exception, the facts proved may not discharge the
said burden, but may affect the proof of the ingredients of the offence. In this
category the Supreme Court has placed Secs. 80 and 84 of the Penal Code, 1860. Sec.
80 is concerned with an accident, where the consequences brought about are naturally
unintentional; while Sec. 84 deals with the unsoundness of mind of the accused i.e.
absence of capacity in the accused to form an intention.
130. In our view, the claim to an Exception under Sec. 96 of the Penal Code, 1860
does not fall in the third category of cases,
because if there is a reasonable doubt regarding the correctness or otherwise of the
claim of the accused, none of the ingredients of the offence defined in Sec. 299 of the
Penal Code, 1860 is effected.
131. To us it appears that Sec. 96 is more akin to Secs. 77, 78, 79, 81 and 88 of
the Penal Code, 1860 and falls in the second category of cases contemplated by the
Supreme Court. Though the Supreme Court has held that as far as the second
category of cases is concerned, the burden of bringing his case under the Exception
lies on the accused, it has not poroceded to consider as to what would be the result if
there is a reasonable doubt regarding the claim of the accused. The observation of the
Supreme Court that "the alleged conflict between the general burden which lies on the
prosecution and the special burden imposed on the accused under Sec. 105 of the
Evidence Act is more imaginary than real" applies, in our judgment, with equal force
to the second category of cases; and if a doubt is created in the mind of the Court that
the defence of the accused might reasonably be true, a resultant doubt would accrue
about the commission of the crime and hence the guilt of the accused. Thus from a
practical point of view there is no difference in the result whether the defence raised
by the accused falls within the second or third category of "Exceptions".
132. In the result we answer the question referred to the Full Bench as under:
The dictum of the majority of learned Judges of this Court in Prabhoo V. Emperor1 is
still good law. But, it may be elucidated that in a case in which any general
Exception in the Penal Code, 1860 is pleaded by an accused and evidence is
adduced to support such a plea, but such evidence fails to satisfy the Court
affirmatively that the accused has fully established his plea of the claimed
Exception, he will still be entitled to an acquittal, if, upon a consideration of the
evidence as a whole (including the evidence given in support of the plea of the said
general Exception), a reasonable consequential doubt is created in the mind of the
Court as to whether the accused is really guilty of the offence with which he is
charged.
133. M.H. BEG, J.: - The question we have to answer, the facts and circumstances
leading to its reference to a Full Bench of nine Judges, and the authorities cited by
both sides, have been very fully set out in the judgment of my learned brother D.S.
Mathur, J. I concur with the views expressed there on a number of points but
respectfully differ on others indicated below. I find myself in respectful disagreement
also with Oak, C.J., on the questions whether there is some conflict either between the
Indian law and English law on burden of proof when the plea of private defence is set
up or between the majority view in Prabhoo's1 case and the Supreme Court's
interpretation of Sec. 105 of the Indian Evidence Act (hereinafter referred to as the Act
also). I have endeavoured to show, in the course of this opinion, that Sec. 105 of the
Act does not depart from the principles of English law of Evidence on the plea of
private defence and that the majority views in Prabhoo's1 case were meant to answer
questions which only arise in a case of reasonable doubt on the ingredients of an
offence even where the exception pleaded is not established or completely proved.
These questions did not arise in Munshi Ram V. Delhi Administration10 and in other
cases of the Supreme Court which Lay down that an exception pleaded can be
completely proved only by a preponderance of probability. Application
of different principles due to differing degrees of proof given by each side in different
types of cases on facts does not involve a conflict of principles applied which have
been taken from English law. For this reason and others, explained below in detail, I
respectfully differ from the opinion expressed by my learned brethren who have
referred this case to a Full Bench on the ground that decisions of the Supreme Court
have "cast a cloud of doubt" on the correctness of the majority view in Prabhoo's1
case. I concur with the views ex pressed and conclusions recorded by my learned
brethren Broome, Gupta and Parekh, JJ., and also with the conclusions reached by my
learned brethren Gyanendra Kumar and Yashoda Nandan, JJ. My learned brother
Mukerjee, J., has also dissented from the majority view here which only reaffirms and
explains the majority view in Prabhoo's1 case. I share the majority view here
expressed, also by my learned brother D.S. Mathur, J., on this point, that the plea of
private defence falls in the category of cases in which proof of the exception affects
ingredients of the offence which the prosecution has to prove beyond reasonable
doubt. I entirely agree with D.S Mathur, J., that the majority view in Prabhoo's1 case
correctly states the law, but I am unable to go so far as to hold that the majority
actually committed an error of law in stating its conclusion in such a way that its
answer does not accord with the reasoning. I prefer to use the word "answer" in place
of the word "dictum" (which has a special significance attached to it), used in the
question referred to us. I do not, with great respect, find it possible to go beyond
saying that, if the answer has been misunderstood, it may be restated so as to bring
out its real meaning more clearly. Before I restate the answer, as I understand it, or,
proceed to elaborate my reasons to support the restatement, I will summarise the
main contentions of the WO sides.
134. The Advocate General of Uttar Pradesh assailed the correctness as well as the
validity today of the majority view in Prabhoo's1 case. He submitted that this view was
based on a misapprehension and misapplication of what was decided in
Woolmingtons14 case. According to learned counsel, the principle laid down in
Woolmington's14 case did not apply to cases of statutory exceptions, such as those
covered by Sec. 105 of the Act, because Lord Sankey said so clearly there. The
majority view in Prabhoo's1 case, according to the Advocate General, substitutes the
negative test of a doubtful plea for the positive statutory requirement of a proved
exception laid down by Sec. 105. It was submitted that a negative test, requiring
elimination of reasonable doubts, was to be satisfied only by the prosecution, but the
accused had to prove a positive case and could not succeed by merely raising doubts
that his plea may be true. It was contended that the two burdens, one of the
prosecution to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt, and the other of the accused,
to prove his plea by a "preponderance of probabilities" had to be kept distinct and
apart. It was urged that evidence tendered to discharge each burden had to be viewed
separately and not confused. The majority view, in Prabhoo's1 case had, according to
the Advocate General, wrongly treated the accused's burden as a "minor" one of
"bringing his case within an exception" and had then held it to be capable of discharge
by mere doubts instead of by credible or acceptable evidence. All proof, according to
the Advocate General, had to rest on "preponderance of probabilities" so as to appeal
to reason and prudence, but the test adopted by the majority, for judging the
accused's plea, was imprudent and unreasonable, and, therefore, illegal. Such a test,
it was submitted, was inconsistent with the test of what was "proved" propounded by
the Supreme Court in several recent cases: C.S.D. Swami V. The State4; Bhikari V. The
State of U.P.6. Harbhajan Singh V. State of Punjab V.D. Jhingan V. State of U.P.Â°-
Munshi Ram V. Delhi Administration10 The Advocate General went so far as to contend
that, if the majority view in Prabhoo's case was correct, the weaker the case of an
accused, and, therefore, the greater the doubt about it, the brighter
would be the prospect of an acquittal before the accused. This amounted, the learned
counsel urged, to a direction to acquit accused with doubtful defences instead of
acquitting them only on doubtful prosecution cases against them. It had, he informed
us, actually resulted in a number of unjustified acquittals and miscarriages of justice.
Doubt, the Advocate General argued, could only be an obstacle or impediment in the
way of the prosecution, but it could not be the foundation of or substitute for the
positive proof required by law. It could not, therefore, be converted into an aid given
to the accused to help them to surmount what Sec. 105 compels them to prove before
claiming acquittal. Considerable emphasis was laid on the duty of the court, under the
last part of Sec. 105, read with Sec. 4 of the Act, to presume absence of
circumstances entitling the accused to the benefit of an exception unless and until the
contrary was actually proved. It was contended that, at least so far as rules relating to
burden of proof were concerned, the Evidence Act, which was meant to provide a
complete and comprehensive code without invoking the aid of any external rules, was
exhaustive. It was, therefore, the duty of courts to enforce the provisions of the Act,
instead of making law which should be left to the legislature.
135. Mr. P.C. Chaturvedi, appearing for the accused, contended that the accused
could be presumed to discharge the positive burden of proving an exception pleaded if
he succeeds in creating a reasonable doubt by evidence, from whichever side it came,
that his plea may be true. According to him, the standard of proof required by a
prudent man, laid down by Sec. 3 of the Act, would be satisfied by a hypothesis.
Prudence, according to him, always bases its judgments on reasonable hypothesis and
not on certainties which are seldom possible in judging human affairs. And, Sec. 3 of
the Act, learned counsel pointed out, specifically enacts that the prudent man not only
could but "ought, under the circumstances of the particular case, to act upon the
supposition" that a state of facts exists. His contention was that the duty of the
prudent man to act upon a supposition, based no doubt on probabilities, obliges the
prudent man to equate reasonable doubt that the accused's case may be covered by
an exception with "proof" of the exception in a criminal case. Such an elastic and
variable concept of prudence and proof, which differs in its application from case to
case, was implicit, according to learned counsel, in Sec. 3 of the Act itself. In criminal
cases, involving deprivations of life and liberty, much depended on oral testimony
which may be defective or perjured. Therefore, in order to avoid the lurking risks of
grave injustice, it was necessary, according to learned counsel, not to unduly limit the
scope of the principle of Benefit of doubt. Learned counsel went to the extent of asking
us to countenance even a fiction, if need be, so as to meet or to repel the obligatory
presumption under Sec. 105 and thus to remove what the learned counsel tried to
depict as a possible impediment in the way of justice, equity, and prudence. The
learned counsel invited us to consider the consequences in cases where evidence was
so equibalanced, on a disputed question of possession of property or on the question
whether one or the other party was the aggressor in a fight, that the astutest judge
could not possibly determine which of two rival versions was correct. Learned counsel
urged that, on the State's interpretation, both sides will have to be convicted in such
cases as neither side could prove its defence case positively by a "preponderance of
probabilities." Lastly, the learned counsel argued that Sec. 6 of the Penal Code, 1860,
read with Sec. 21(5), Criminal Procedure Code, placed the burden upon the
prosecution of negativing the exceptions pleaded by the accused. This conclusion,
according to learned counsel, necessarily flows from the proposition that the absence
of an exception was an ingredient of each offence defined by the Penal Code, 1860.
The prosecutions primary and unalterable duty to dispel all reasonable doubt in a
criminal case must, it was contended, extend to removing such doubts arising from
anything whatsoever in the case which courts could properly and legally consider.
136. Much unnecessary confusion, which has gathered round the relevant
provisions of the Act, will vanish if we adopt the time honoured mode of construing
statutes formulated in the form of rules as far back as 1584 in Heydon's case (3 Co.
Hep. 8) so as to remove ambiguities by examining the mischief meant to be remedied.
These rules were adopted by the Supreme Court and cited with approval in Bengal
Immunity Co. V. State of Bihar42. In Craie's "Statute law" (5th Ed. p. 91), it was
observed: "These rules are still in full force and effect, with the addition that regard
must now be had not only to the common law, but also to prior legislation and to the
judicial interpretation thereof." Fletcher Moulton, L.J., observed in Machmillan V.
Dent43:
"In order properly to interpret any statute it is as necessary now as it was when
Lord Coke reported Heydon's case, to consider how the law stood when the statute
to be construed was passed, what the mischief was for which the old law did not
provide, and the remedy provided by the statute to cure that mischief."
137. Lindley, M.R., In Re. Mayfair Property Co.44 said:-
"In interpreting an act of Parliament you are entitled, and in many cases bound, to
look to the state of the law at the date of the passing of the Act; not only the
common law but the law as it then stood under previous statutes, in order properly
to interpret the statute in question."
138. In S. Kabra V. State of Madras4 also the Supreme Court referred to these
rules. It held that, in construing the section of an act and determining its true scope,
"it is permissible to have regard to all such factors as can legitimately be taken into
account in ascertaining the intention of the legislature, such as history of the statute,
the reason which led to its being passed, the mischief which it intended to suppress
and the remedy provided by the Statute for curing the mischief."
139. The concepts of "proved", "disproved", and "not proved", defined in alluringly
simple terms in the act, compress a great deal of judicial wisdom with history and
processes of evolution and development behind them which have not yet ended. The
term 'Burden of proof' is not defined in the Act and cannot be fully understood without
an exposition of its place and meaning in our procedural law as a whole. For an
adequate understanding of the import of these basic concepts, even when they are
incorporated in a comprehensive code, we have to necessarily examine their sources,
the context in which they were given statutory form, the purposes they were designed
to serve, and the functions they actually fulfil. Cut off from these moorings they may
become ugly caricatures of that justice which all law is meant to serve. It is obvious
that a mechanical interpretation with the help of a dictionary and rules of grammar,
found to be inadequate on several occasions by our Supreme Court e.g. Deputy
Custodian V. Official Receiver46; Kanwar Singh V. Delhi Administration47 R.L. Arora V.
State of U.P.48. State of U.P. V. C. Tobit49, may not suffice here also.
140. Our Evidence Act is the first of the three comprehensive codifications of our
adjectival or procedural laws introduced with the object of enabling courts to correctly
ascertain those facts which determine rights and liabilities defined by the substantive
laws. It provides for the adduction of evidence declared relevant and in a logical order
conformably with rules of natural justice and reason so that truth may be brought out
so far as possible and not obecured. Its purpose was "to consolidate, define, and
amend the law of Evidence" so that inadequacies and uncertainties in this branch of
our law may be removed. It is no secret that this was
sought to be accomplished by basing the Act on principles and rules evolved by the
judge made Anglo Saxon law of evidence with slight modifications but without
departing from its basic norms. Therefore, to these principles and rules we have to
turn to find out the meanings of ambiguous expressions.
141. We find that the term "Burden of Proof", as used in English law, both at the
time when Sin James Fitzjames Stephen drafted the Act and also today, carries within
it two meanings. I may quote from Phipson on Evidence (10th ed., at p. 43) to
indicate the two senses:-
"As applied to judicial proceedings the phrase 'burden of proof' has two distinct and
frequently confused meanings: (1) the burden of proof as a matter of law and
pleading-the burden, as it has been called, of establishing a case, whether by
preponderance of evidence, or beyond a reasonable doubt; and (2) the burden of
proof in the sense of introducing evidence." Again, we find here (p. 45):
"It is in the second sense that the term is more generally used, and must be
applied in the following pages; and while the burden of proof in the first sense is
always stable, the burden of proof in the second sense may shift constantly,
according as one scale of evidence or the other preponderates."
Whenever the law places a burden of proof upon a party a presumption operates
against it. Hence, burdens of proof and presumptions have to be considered
together. It has been said that a rebuttable presumption always covers a gap in
evidence, but the gap, and, together with it, the presumption will disappear as soon
as there is credible evidence to fill the gap. The extent of the gap, in the eye of law,
will vary with the nature of the presumption. The burden of establishing a plea
connotes a bigger gap requiring more acceptable evidence to fill it than the burden
of removing a presumption that no circumstances; whatsoever exist to support the
plea. As has been often pointed out, when there is ample evidence from both sides,
the fate of the case is no longer determined by presumptions or burdens of proof,
but by a careful selection of the correct version, based no doubt on preponderance
of probabilities which has to be so compulsive or overwhelming in the case of a
choice in favour of a conviction as to remove all reasonable doubt. In other words,
the importance of burdens of proof and presumptions vanishes in the face of
evidence given by both sides. They may, however, become decisive again in cases
where evidence is equi balanced. Thus, their function is decisive only in cases where
there is paucity of evidence on either side or the evidence given by the two sides is
equi balanced. Neither a burden of proof nor a rebuttable presumption can be used
for excluding any evidence. That is not their function at all but of other provisions of
law.
In Phipson's Evidence (10th ed. p. 838), it is pointed out: "The chief function of a
rebuttable presumption of law is to determine upon whom the burden of proof
rests, using that term in the sense of adducing evidence." Wigmore, the celebrated
American authority of the law of Evidence, dealing with the "Legal Effect of
a
presumption" (See 3rd ed., Vol: IX p. 289) explains: "
it must be kept in mind
that the peculiar effect of a presumption "of law" (that is, the real presumption) is
merely to invoke a rule of law compelling the jury to reach the conclusion 'in the
absence of evidence to the contrary' from the opponent. If the opponent does offer
evidence to the contrary (sufficient to satisfy the Judge's requirement of some
evidence), the presumption disappears as a rule of law, and the case is in the jury's
hands free from any rule." Again, he observed (3rd ed., Vol. IX, p. 290) : "It is,
therefore, a fallacy to attribute (as do some judges) an artificial probative force to a
presumption, increasing for the jury the weight of the facts, even when the
opponent has come forward with some evidence to the contrary. For example, if
death be the issue, and the fact of absence for seven years unheard from be
conceded, but the opponent offers evidence
that the absentee, before leaving, proclaimed his intention of staying away for ten
years, until a prosecution for crime was barred, this satisfies the opponent's duty of
producing evidence, removing the rule of law; and when the case goes to the jury,
they are at liberty to give any probative force they think fit to the fact of absence for
seven years unheard from. It is not weighed down with any artificial additional
probative effect; they may estimate it for just such intrinsic effect as it seems to have
under all the circumstances. This much is a plain consequence in our mode of jury
trial; and the fallacy has arisen through attempting to follow the ancient continental
phraseology, which grew up under the quantitative system of evidence, fixing artificial
rules for the judge's measurement of proof."
142. It is true that the rules of evidence indicated above were evolved in the course
of development of a mode of trial in which the judge gave guidance on questions of
law and the jury pronounced its verdicts on questions of fact. Neverthless, when these
every guiding principles were sought to be reduced to the form of a code, the basic
principles could not be deemed to be abandoned or departed from without clear words
to the contrary. In fact, it is not possible to appreciate the true meaning of a number
of provisions of the Act, including Sec. 105, without exploring the law contained in the
sources of the codification. If, however, the above mentioned expositions are kept in
view, it becomes quite easy to interpret Sec. 105 of the Act which covers the burden
of establishing as well as the duty of introducing evidence of exceptions set up by the
accused. It becomes clear that the obligation of the Court to presume absence of
circumstances supporting a plea is meant to operate only initially. The presumption
which the Court is obliged to make vanishes when any circumstances supporting the
exception are proved. On the other hand, the duty or the burden of the accused, dealt
with in the first part of Sec. 105, to establish the exception pleaded may remain even
after the initial presumption against him is removed as a result of evidence of either
side. The obligation of the Court to presume initially absence of circumstances to
support an exception cannot be used to eliminate or wipe out facts actually proved
from either side even though they are not sufficient to establish an exception. The
circumstances actually proved, even though falling short of proving the plea of the
accused by a preponderance of evidence will, nevertheless, free the case from the
initial presumption that no circumstances at all exist to support the exception pleaded.
The case will then be decided on the whole evidence. This is all that Sec. 105, read
with other provisions of the Act, clearly means.
143. If, for example, an accused "proves" infliction of injuries on him by the
complainant in the course of the occurrence which is the subject-matter of the charge,
he certainly proves some of the circumstances to support a plea of self-defence. The
obligatory initial presumption against him is removed. Nevertheless, he may be
convicted if the prosecution evidence proves that these injuries were indubitably
caused in the exercise of a right of private defence by the complainant. But, his
conviction would not be the result of any presumption under the last part of Sec. 105.
It would follow from the superior proof given by the prosecution either direct or
circumstantial or both. On the other hand, added to injuries on the person of the
accused, proved to have been caused by the complainant during the occurrence, the
accused may succeed in proving, even from such circumstances as an attempt of the
prosecution to conceal these injuries, that there is a doubt about the veracity of the
prosecution version itself and that his plea of self-defence, although not positively
established, may reasonably be true. In such a case, the prosecution could not use the
presumption contained in the last part of Sec. 105 to secure a conviction. No doubt,
the prosecution will fail, in such a case, because it has failed to prove its own case
beyond reasonable doubt. But, the doubt it has failed to eliminate would have been
introduced by proved facts relied upon by the accused to establish the
plea of an exception. The facts relied upon for proving an exception could not be
automatically be equated with facts disproved or disentitle the accused from getting
the benefit of an exception simply because he could not fully prove, by a
"preponderance of evidence," the exception pleaded. A plea taken but left in the
region of "not proved" by the evidence on record may be enough, on a criminal charge,
for a bare acquittal provided the doubt introduced by some proved facts and
circumstances, displacing the initial obligatory presumption, is strong enough to
reasonably shake the moral conviction of guilt of the accused on the charge level led
against him. This seems to me to be the line of reasoning underlying the majority view
in Prabhoo's1 case. It seems to be both practical and just. It accords with very firmly
established principles of proof and burden of proof applicable to criminal trials in this
country as well as with the provisions of the Act read as a whole. I confess that I fail
to see any flaw in it.
144. The contrary view would erect the initial presumption under Sec. 105 into an
artificial barrier against the entry of a reasonable doubt into the prosecution case even
when the accused, though failing to fully prove an exception, actually creates a
reasonable doubt. Not only is it humanly impossible for a judge to keep evidence
confined in two separate watertight compartments of his mind, but it would also be
illegal for him to do SO. Apart from being much too unrealistic a view, this would
restrict the powers of the Court to judge, on all the materials placed before it, whether
the prosecution has proved its case beyond reasonable doubt or not. It would equate
relevant and proved facts with what is either irrelevant and inadmissible or disproved.
Such a view would clearly infring Sec. 3, and, indirectly, also provisions relating to
relevancy by reducing even facts duly proved as relevant to the same position as those
which are irrelevant and excluded. Such a course seems warranted neither by law non
by any canon of justice or expediency.
145. In Prabhoo's1 case, Bajpai, J. held that the fixed or stable burden of proof is
found in Secs. 101 and 102 of the Evidence Act, whereas Secs. 103 and 105 of the Act
contain the unstable burden which shifts in the course of the trial "as one scale of
evidence preponderates over the other." In other words, preponderance of evidence
was the test to be used in criminal as well as in civil cases for judging the veracity of a
case, the only distinction being that such preponderance has to be great or
overwhelming enough to eliminate reasonable doubt to warrant conviction in a
criminal trial. Again, Mulla, J., who expressed the opinion, in Prabhoo's case, that the
principle of reasonable doubt may not be found incorporated "in its entirety" in Secs. 3
and 101 of the Act, relied on Sir John Woodroffe's work on Evidence to hold that the
test which the prosecution had to satisfy to secure conviction by proving its case
beyond reasonable doubt was higher than the ordinary criterion of "preponderance of
probality" contained in Sec. 3. Even this expression of an individual opinion by Mulla,
J. implied that all parties, other than prosecutors, were required to satisfy the test of
"preponderance of probability" for proving their pleas or cases. To hold that the special
burden of the prosecution to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt is higher than the
burden which lies upon a party in a civil proceeding or upon an accused under Sec.
105 of the Act does not mean that the accused could establish his own plea
completely by anything less than a "preponderance of probabilities." Whenever the
Supreme Court had held that the burden of the accused under Sec. 105 was
discharged on a balancing of probabilities, it had referred to a full discharge of the
burden; but, that was not the type of case under consideration in Prabhoo's1 case.
146. Again, to hold that, even if the accused failed to prove the plea fully, it was
possible that he may yet succeed in shaking the foundations of the prosecution case
and obtain an acquittal on a reasonable doubt is not to lesson the burden of what may
be called a "clean acquittal."
There is a difference between a complete exoneration, which is only possible when an
accused turns the balance of probability in his favour, and a bare benefit of doubt,
which is not entirely devoid of harmful consequences for the accused. The Supreme
Court had also held that Sec. 105 did not prevent the court from giving the benefit of
doubt altogether to an accused pleading an exception, or in other words, Sec. 105
makes possible both kinds of acquittal-one by proving his plea fully and another by
raising genuine doubt in the case. Ismail, J. observed in Prabhoo's1 case, that the
difficulty to be resolved arose only in those limited number of cases where evidence in
the case "falls short of proof but creates a reasonable doubt in the mind of the Court
whether the accused person is or is not entitled to the benefit of the exception." He
pointed out that the question before the Full Bench was whether in such a case, which
was before the Court, the court had no option except to convict. The majority of their
Lordships rightly held, just as the Supreme Court later held, that the Court could not
be expected to convict in such a case. It is not permissible, in my opinion, to extend
the ratio decidendi of Prabhoo's1 case beyond what was decided there.
147. In Parbhoo's1 case, the learned Chief Justice spoke of the accused's "minor
burden of bringing his case within the exception or proviso relied upon by him."
Ismail, J. considered that the decision on the question of self-defence would only be a
"decision upon one of the issues in the case." The Advocate General contended that
this approach to the plea of the accused was itself erroneous inasmuch as it gave the
impression that the accused had to prove something less than a preponderence of
probabilities to establish his case. All that seems to have meant, in describing the
burden of the accused as "minor" compared with that of the prosecution, was to
contrast it with the heavier burden of the prosecution to eliminate reasonable doubts
which may creep in about the veracity of the prosecution version. There seemed to be
no intention to reduce the burden of the accused below what the law required. On the
other hand, Bajpai, J. took some pains to explain that the nature of the doubt "as to
the plea of the right of private defence," which was before the court, in Prabhoo's1
case, was that a "doubt had been cast in connection with the entire case." He
emphasised that it had to be a reasonable doubt which "reacts on the whole case." He
made it clear that the doubt he had in mind was one which "pervades the whole case."
In fact, the learned Judge indicated that it would be wrong to assume that the doubt
before the court did not affect "the ingredients of the offence with which the accused
has been charged" (the words used by him are italicized). In other words, the nature
of the doubt contemplated or assumed to exist for the purposes of answering the
question before their lordships in that case was one which affected the ingredients of
the offence.
148. In fact, Prabhoo's1 case was not concerned with the quantum of credible
evidence in support of the plea of the accused which could "infect", if I may use that
word, the whole prosecution case and stamp it with doubt, even though it falls short of
fully establishing the plea of private defence. The question framed in Prabhoo's case
proceeded on the assumption that the evidence given by the accused was credible
with regard to some of the circumstances proved in support of the plea of private
defence and threw a resonable doubt on an Ingredient of an offence even if it did not
establish the plea of private defence by a preponderance of probabilities. The answers
given in Prabhoo's1 case were based upon that assumption. It may be mentioned here
that in each of the two Rangoon cases, which the majority purported to follow in
Prabhoo's1 case, the plea of accused was quite substantially supported on facts. In U.
Thampala V. Emperor50 the first question framed, which is relevant here, indicated that
the exception was so well supported that the court could be in doubt whether the
exception
itself was proved or not. In Nga Them V. The King51 the facts found against the victim
and in favour of the accused were quite substantial. It is in cases of this sort that
genuine doubts arise.
149. There is a difference between a flimsy or fantastic plea which is to be rejected
altogether and a reasonable but incompletely proved plea which casts a genuine doubt
on the prosecution version so that it indirectly succeeds. Praghoo's case was not
meant to afford any guidance on what reasonable doubt itself means. The doubt which
the law contemplates is certainly not that of a weak or unduly vacillating, capricious,
indolent, drowsy, or confused mind. It must be the doubt of the prudent man who is
assumed to possess the capacity to "separate the chaff from the grain". It is the doubt
of a reasonable, astute, and alert mind arrived at after due application of mind to
every relevant circumstances of the case appearing from the evidence.
150. I may mention here that in two reported cases I have tried to point out that
courts must reach, whenever possible, definite conclusions by a careful analysis of the
evidence and not take shelter behind a supposed uncertainty created by the facts
appraised from a preconceived angle. Those cases are: Bharose V. State52 which was a
case resulting in two deaths, one on each side, from a fight over a disputed possession
of a field, which ended in a conviction; and, Mangat V. State53 where there were
injuries on both sides, but the case ended in a conviction on the finding that the
aggression came from the side of the accused. I doubt whether what was laid down
quite correctly but in rather general terms by the majority in Prabhoo's1 case has been
really widely misunderstood. If any case of a real misundrestanding of the law by a
trial court occurs, it can be brought to the notice of this Court by appropriate
proceedings taken by the State or by the complainant.
151. Perhaps the most important aspect of Prabhoo's case, which learned counsel
for both sides seem to have assumed that we will see for ourselves, was stated by
Iqbal Ahmad, C.J., at the outset when it was indicated that the real question before
the Court in that case was whether "the evidence produced by the accused persons,
even though falling short of proving affirmatively the existence of the circumstances
bringing the case within the exception pleaded by him, can be utilized as part of the
entire evidence in the case for the purpose of showing that a reasonable doubt exists
as to his guilt." The learned Chief Justice thus stated the prosecutions submission on
this question. "The argument is that, unless the accused succeeds in proving that his
case comes within the 'exception' or proviso pleaded by him, the evidence led by him
must be totally discarded and the court must proceed on the definite supposition that
there was an entire absence of the exception or 'proviso' relied upon by the accused."
It seems to me that on this question, involving a correct interpretation of the
obligatory presumption at the end of Sec. 105, there is no escape from the answer
given by the majority in Prabhoo's1 case unless the accused is to be denied the benefit
of doubt altogether when he pleads an exception. Any answer other than the one given
by the majority in Prabhoo's1 case will involve a clear with propositions enunciated by
the Supreme Court in Nanavati's5 case and Dahyabhai's case and Bhikari's case,
discussed by me below, which necessarily mean that the whole evidence must
determine the result.
152. lqbal Ahmad, C.J., in Prabhoo's case also referred to the argument of Sin
Wazir Hasan that Sec. 6 of the I.P.C. provided a part of the definition of every offence.
This section reads as follows:
"Throughout this Code every definition of an offence, every penal provision every
illustration of every such definition or penal provision, shall be understood subject
to the exceptions contained in the chapter entitled 'General Exception', though
exceptions are not repeated in such
definition, penal provision, or illustration."
153. The learned Chief Justice held that, although this conception was correct, yet,
Sec. 105 of the Act would become ineffective if the further argument, built on it, was
accepted that Sec. 6, I.P.C., imposed automatically a burden of disproving the
existence of exceptions upon the prosecution. Thus, the prosecution was not required
to lead evidence to prove that an accused person was sane. Even in the absence of any
provision, such as Sec. 105 of the Act, this would be the position. The ordinary
presumption would be that every individual concerned in a case is sane, unless and
until the contrary is proved, or, at least, until the validity of the presumption is
shaken. Similarly, every person inflicting an injury on another would be presumed to
have done so with intent to cause it without any lawful excuse unless a justification,
such as the exercise of a right of private defence, was either fully proved or its
existence could be quite reasonably conceived on facts proved. Sec. 103 of the
Evidence Act was there to place the burden of proving special facts to sustain the plea
of an exception upon the accused. There seemed, therefore, no particular reason for
Sec. 105 in the Act unless the reasoning which appealed to the learned Chief Justice,
that it effectively meets an argument based on Sec. 6, I.P.C., was present in the
minds of the framers of Sec. 105 also.
154. Sec. 105 of the Act specifically refers to the provisions of the Penal Code,
1860 which were before the draftsman. It must be presumed that the Legislature was
fully aware of Sec. 6 I.P.C. Therefore, Sec. 105 of the Act seemed necessary in order to
meet a possible construction which was not intended. In other words, Sec. 105 serves
the purpose sometimes served by a proviso (See: Maxwell's "interpretation of
Statutes" 11th Edn., page 156). Of course, it could be looked upon as analogous to a
proviso only if we view Sec. 6, I.P.C. and Sec. 105 of the Act together. It is certainly
difficult to see the purpose of Sec. 105 of the Act unless it is viewed in the context of
Sec. 6, I.P.C.
155. The argument that some negative burden may rest upon the prosecution
seems to have been accepted by the Advocate General by implication when he
conceded that the prosecution's burden extends to eliminating doubts which may arise
from the evidence on the record. Sec. 105 of the Act could have been enacted to repel
the more embitious contention, which was actually advanced in Prabhoo's case by Sin
Wazir Hasan and before us by Mr. P.C. Chaturvedi, that the prosecution must actually
disprove, as a part of even its initial duty, all possible exceptions which may be set up
by the accused because Sec. 6 of the I.P.C. annexes absence of exceptions to every
definition of an offence. At least, its utility and effect do not seem to extend further
than repelling such contentions because all else it enacts seems already covered by
Sec. 103 of the Act. And, as we know, there is a presumption against redundancy.
156. The Advocate General repeated the argument accepted by the minority in
Prabhoo's1 case that English law of Evidence and English authorities could not be used
for interpreting the provisions of our Evidence Act. Learned counsel tried to invoke the
aid of Sec. 2 of the Act. He contended that its repeal in 1938 did not alter the position.
Here again, I think we must apply the Mischief Rule in order to appreciate the effect of
the repealed Sec. 2 of the Act. It appears to me that the repealed section was directed
only against rules of evidence which prevailed in this country independently of
statutory authority. It did not prevent an examination of the sources upon which the
codification contained in the Act is based when there is a doubt about the meaning of
any particular provision. It certainly did not bar the adoption of correct canons of
construction in interpreting the provisions of the Act.
157. The extent to which English authorities could be used in interpreting
provisions of those enactments which are largely based on English law has been
indicated on a number of occasions by courts in this country.
In State of Punjab V. S.S. Singh54, their Lordships of the Supreme Court who took the
majority as well as the minority views did refer quite extensively to the English
sources and authorities in order to determine the correct meaning and scope of some
of the provisions of the Evidence Act. It is true that the majority, after referring to an
argument of a learned counsel, based upon the supposed intention of Sir James
Fitzjames Stephen in drafting provisions of Secs. 123 and 162 of the Act, observed
that the learned counsel "fairly conceded that recourse to extrinsic aid in interpreting
the statutory provisions would be justified within well recognised limits; and that
primarily the effect of statutory provisions must be judged on a fair and reasonable
construction of the words used by the statute itself.' The majority did not, however,
expressly dissent from a somewhat different proposition stated by Subba Rao, J.,
when his lordship said: "The dictionary meanings do not help to decide the content of
the said words. The content of the said words, therefore, can be gathered only from
the history of the provisions. It has been acknowledged generally, with some
exceptions, that the Indian Evidence Act was intended to and did in fact consolidate
the English law of Evidence. It has been often stated with justification that Sir James
Stephen has attempted to crystalise the principles contained in Taylor's work into
substantive propositions. In case of doubt or ambiguity over the interpretation of any
of the sections of the Evidence Act we can with profit look to the relevant English
Common Law for ascertaining their true meaning." It is true that, where provisions of
the Act are clear and unambiguous, no recourse to extrinsic matter, even if it consists
of the sources of the codification, would be permissible. But, the position before us is,
as already indicated, that it is not possible to fully bring out the meaning of Sec. 105
of the Act itself without reference to the principle found in the sources of the Act
contained in English Law. At least, the aspect of Sec. 105 which was raised and
considered in Prabhoo's case made it necessary to go to those sources.
158. The majority of the judges deciding Prabhoo's case did attach considerable
importance to what was held by the House of Lords in Woolmington's case. But, they
also examined the meanings of the words used in the relevant provisions of the Act to
determine the scope of the burden of proof resting upon the accused under Sec. 105
of the Act. The mere fact that they sought support from the basic principles laid down
in Woolmington's case could not make their interpretation incorrect. It only added
weight to the view taken by their lordships. Perhaps, it would have been better to refer
to Woolmington's case after interpreting the language used in the relevant provisions
of the Act. This, however, does not affect the correctness of the view taken by the
majority. Even Collister, J., expressing the minority view, in Prabhoo's1 case, turned to
the statement of the law in Foster's "Crown Laws", for discovering a possible source or
basis for Sec. 105 of our Act. Allsop, J., seems to have held the view that Sec. 2 of the
Evidence Act (no one seems to have pointed out that it was repealed then) prohibited
even use of English authorities. Braund, J., took the view: "The law of England is one
thing and the law of India another." If one may say so, with very great respect, the
erroneous assumption which seemed to underline the minority view in Prabhaoo's1
case was that the law in India must be different from that in England on questions of
burdens of proof of the prosecution and the accused and that the twain did not meet
here. This assumption seems to have stirred the judicial instinct of that great Judge of
this Court on the Criminal side, Tej Narain Mulla, J., so much that he declared it to be
"fundamentally wrong."
159. The English law on burdens of establishing cases in criminal trials is thus
stated in Phipson's Evidence (10th Edn., paragraph 101, page 49): "Generally in
criminal cases (unless otherwise directed by statute) the presumption of innocence
casts
on the prosecutor the burden of proving every ingredient of an offence, even though
negative averments be involved therein. Thus, in cases of murder the burden of
proving death as a result of the voluntary act of the accused and malice on his part is
on the prosecution
And the prosecution is bound to negative any
exception favourable to the defendant which is engrafted in the statutory description
of the offence though not one contained in a separate clause." Vide: Robert: V.

160. If this was the state of law in England, round about 1872, as it appears from
Roberts V. Humphereys55, decided in 1873, it will be evident why Sec. 105 of our
Evidence Act, passed in 1872, became necessary. Although, the exceptions contained
in the Penal Code, 1860, to which Sec. 105 of the Act refers, are contained in separate
sections, yet, the result of Sec. 6 of the Penal Code, 1860 could well be said to be that
the exceptions were engrafted in every definition of an offence as though they formed
parts of each section defining an offence. The language of Sec. 6 Penal Code, 1860 is
quite explicit. Therefore, Sec. 105 of the Act became necessary so as to make it clear
that, notwithstanding such a statutory provision, the ordinary rule of English law of
Evidence, that an exception found in a spearate clause or section has to be established
by the party claiming its benefit, will apply in this country also. In other words, as
I
see it, Sec. 105 of the Act was introduced not in order to depart from but to make our
law conform to the norms of English law of evidence on the subject.
161. The basic or primary burden of the prosecution is stated and explained again
in
Phipson's Evidence (10th Ed. paragraph 101, page 49) as follows:
"The prosecution must prove the guilt of the accused and he is under no obligation
to prove his innocence.
It is sufficient for him to raise a reasonable doubt as to his guilt. Thus, where an act
is criminal or the offence is more serious, if it is done with a particular intent, the
burden of proving that intent, in the absence of statutory provision, rests
throughout on the prosecution. If the evidence proves that the accused did an act
the natural consequence of which is a certain result, the jury is entitled to find that
the act was done with the intention of bringing about that result. If on a review of
all the evidence, they are left in doubt, then the prosecution have not discharged
that burden. But generally facts in confession and avoidance are upon him, e.g.,
insanity or diminished responsibility, and the prosecution ought not to assume that
burden."
162. This statement of the law in England seems to me to be applicable with equal
force in this country with this difference that, instead of the jury, courts generally
decide questions of fact also here, and the plea of insanity and other exceptions seem
to stand on the same footing when the ingredients of an offence overlap and conflict
with those of the exception.
1 The burdens of the prosecution and of the accused were thus contrasted in
Phipson's Evidence (10th Ed., paragraph 102 at page 50):
"When the burden of the issue is on the prosecution, the case must, as we have
seen, be proved beyond a reasonable doubt; though a prima facie case made by the
prosecution and not rebutted by the accused may often amount to this, and suffice
for conviction. When, however, the burden of an issue is upon the accused, he is
not, in general, called on to prove it beyond a reasonable doubt or in default to
incur a verdict of guilty; it is sufficient if he succeeds in proving a preponderance of
probability, for then the burden is shifted to the prosecution, which has still to
discharge its original onus that never shifts, i.e., that of establishing on the whole
case, guilt beyond a reasonable doubt."
164. The cases relied upon for this statement of English law were: Mancini V.
D.P.P.Z.
Woolmington V. D.P.P.14. R. V. Stoddard58 R. V. Schama59 R. V. Carr-Briant17; R. V.
Cohen60. R. V. Dunbar1
165. The cases cited above in Phipson's Evidence, to support the statement of the
English law on the subject, include those which deal principally with the discharge of
his full burden by an accused e.g. R. V. Carr-Briant17 and R. V. Dunbar establishing a
"preponderance of probability" in his favour as well as those (e.g. Woolmington V.
D.P.P.14) which revolve round the prosecution's failure to discharge its burden of
proving beyond reasonable doubt. To avoid confusion, it is necessary to bring out the
difference clearly not only between the prosecution's higher onus of proving its case
beyond reasonable doubt and the lower burden of the accused to prove an exception
by a "preponderance of probability" only, but also between a complete proof and a
reasonable doubt as different conclusions. Again, the process of balancing probabilities
prudently, which is common to all cases, and the results of that process, which may
differ from case to case, must also be clearly differentiated.
166. While the process of balancing probabilities is common for all cases, the
burdens of the parties to establish their respective cases in a criminal trial are really
only two in kind; the higher one of the prosecution to establish its case beyond
reasonable doubt and the lower one of the accused to prove his plea by a mere
preponderance of probability. As, however, the conclusions which can emerge from the
process of assessing evidence include a state of reasonable doubt about the existence
of an exception pleaded by the accused, which necessarily involves the failure of the
prosecution to discharge its burden of eliminating reasonable doubt when an
ingredient of an offence becomes involved, the result, viewed from the point of view of
the practical or actual, as distinguished from the legally imposed, burden of the
accused, is sometimes put as it is in Phipson's Evidence where it is stated that it is
"enough" for the accused to raise a reasonable doubt as to his guilt. This mode of
describing the result of the prosecutions higher burden to eliminate reasonable doubt
about the guilt of the accused has led to an attempt to reduce the legally imposed
burden of proving an exception to the lower level of a burden of creating reasonable
doubt only and to equate reasonable doubt with complete proof of an exception. On
the other hand, the duty imposed by law upon the accused to prove the exception
pleaded by him, by a "preponderance of probability", is sought to be used to reduce so
much the prosecution's undeniable burden to eliminate reasonable doubt as to
eliminate the accused's right to the benefit of doubt itself. In my opinion, neither
should "preponderance of probability" be confounded with and reduced to the level of
a reasonable doubt only, nor can the principle of reasonable doubt be eliminated
altogether in a criminal trial. Each of the two kinds of conclusion-proof of an
exception by a preponderance of probability and reasonable doubt about guilt-reflects
a different situation. As soon as a court finds one of these two types of conclusion to
be the correct one to reach in a case the other is necessarily excluded.
167. The legal position of a state of reasonable doubt may be viewed and stated
from two opposite angles. One may recognise, in a realistic fashion, that, although the
law prescribes only the higher burden of the prosecution to prove its case beyond
reasonable doubt and the accused's lower burden of proving his plea by a
preponderance of probability only, yet, there is, in practice, a still lower burden of
creating reasonable doubt about the accused's guilt and that an accused can obtain an
acquittal by statisfying this lower burden too in practice. The objection to stating the
law in this fashion is that it looks like introducing a new type of burden of proof,
although, it may be said, in defence of such a statement of the law, that it only
recognises what is true. Alternatively, one may say that the right of the accused to
obtain the benefit of a reasonable doubt is the necessary outcome and counterpart of
the prosecution's undeniable duty to establish its case beyond reasonable doubt and
that this right is available to the accused even if he fails to discharge his own duty to
prove fully the exception pleaded. This technically more correct way of stating the law
was indicated by Woolmington's1 case and adopted by the majority in Prabhoo's1
case, and, after that, by the Supreme Court. It seems to me that so long as the
accused's legal duty to prove his plea fully as well as his equally clear legal right to
obtain the benefit of reasonable doubt, upon a consideration of the whole evidence, on
an ingredient of an offence, are recognised, a mere difference of mode in describing
the position, from two different angles, is an immaterial matter of form only. Even if
the latter form appears somewhat artificial, it must be preferred after its adoption by
the Supreme Court.
168. The phrase "preponderance of probability" used in Phipson's evidence to
describe the lower burden of the accused for proving his plea and to contrast it with
the higher onus of the prosecution to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt, has
been employed for this very purpose by their lordships of the Supreme Court, as
indicated below. A passage was also cited by Mulla, J., in Prabhoo's1 case, from Wood-
roffe and Amir Ali's Law of Evidence, where the term 'proved', as used in Sec. 3 of the
Act, was explained as implying "a mere preponderance of probability", when applied to
civil cases. My learned brother Gupta has informed me that, in the separate judgment
of my learned brethren Broome, Gupta and Parekh, JJ., the use of this expression was
deliberately avoided as it is liable to be misunderstood. While I respectfully agree that
such an expression can be misunderstood, I prefer to explain it, as I understand it,
rather than avoid using it. I find that this expression is too well established and
recognized, after its repeated use by their lordships of the Supreme Court, for Courts
in this country to be able to eschew it now. As Oak, C.J., has pointed out, the
expression contains, according to the Advocate General, the only test of proof when an
accused pleads, an exception. The use of this expression by the Supreme Court, in
circumstances indicated below, could be said to be the main reason for this reference
to a Full Bench. This expression has also given rise to some differences of opinion
between learned judges of this Court. Therefore, it seems to me to be very necessary
to explain its meaning.
"Preponderance", literally interpreted, means nothing more than an outweighing in
the process of balancing however slight may be the tilt of the balance or the
preponderance. I do not find sufficient grounds for holding that the word has been
used in any other sense whenever it has been used either by our Supreme Court or
by English Courts or by commentators such as Phipson or Sir John Woodroffe. It
covers every tilt or preponderance of the balance of probability whether slight or
overwhelming. In fact, the dividing line between a case of mere "preponderance of
probability" by a slight tilt only of the balance of probability and a case of
reasonable doubt is very thin indeed although it is there. A case of reasonable
doubt must necessarily be one in which, on a balancing of probabilities, two views
are possible. What may appear to one reasonable individual to be a case not fully
proved may appear to another to be so proved on a balancing of probabilities. Such
a case and only such a case would in my opinion, be one of reasonable doubt. A
mere preponderance of probability in favour of the exception pleaded by an accused
would, however, constitute a "complete" proof of the exception for the accused but
a state of reasonable doubt would not. "Complete" proof for the prosecution cannot
fall short of elimination of reasonable doubt about the ingredients, of an offence. If
one is clear about the meanings of the terms Used no misapprehensions need arise.
169. It was contended by the Advocate General that the English Law had been
misunderstood by the majority in Prabhoo's case inasmuch as Lord Sankey laid down
in
Woolmington's case that the principle of benefit of doubt was subjected to
statutory exceptions. It is true that in Woolmington's14 case, the House of Lords was
not interpreting any statutory exception to the principle, described as "a golden
thread" always to be seen "throughout the web of English criminal law", that "it is the
duty of the prosecution to prove the prisioner's guilt." But, their lordships were dealing
with a general statement of the law, found in Sir Michael Foster's "Crown Law", which
had been repeated in different forms in Stophen's "Digest of Criminal Law", in
Archbold's "Criminal Pleading, Evidence, and Practice", in Russel on "Crimes", and in
Halsbury's "Laws of England". This statement of the law resembled what is to be found
in Sec. 105 of our Evidence Act so much that Collister, J., in Prabhoo's1 case, almost
took the view that Sec. 105 of the Act was meant to reproduce it. With great respect, I
find some conflict between this view expressed by Collister, J., and a passage in an
earlier part of his judgment where the learned Judge said that he could find no rule of
English law "which exactly corresponds with the provisions of Sec. 105 and certain
other sections". The correspondence may not be exact, but it was close enough to
make Woolminaton's14 case relevant. Moreover, a glance at Roberts V. Humphrevs55
will indicate that, when offences were created by statute, the burden of proving
exceptions was placed on the accused even in England under statutory provisions
meant for clarifying the position. In Woolmington's case, however, the effect of
common Law rules of ordinary presumptions against the accused, arising from proof of
commission of conscious acts, on the principle of Benefit of Doubt was explained. This
was done in the context of the requirement to prove mens rea, still conventionally
spoken of as "malice aforethought", as an ingredient of the offence of murder in
England and of a charge to the jury which could be vitiated by a misplaced emphasis.
Nevertheless, the principles stated and explained there were general and basic.
170. Sec. 105 of the Act is really a part of a general statement of principles derived
from English Common Law rules such as those considered in Woolmington" case. It
does not contain a statutory exception to any general principle. It lays down general
rules for cases in which accused plead exceptions. It merely codifies, in careful and
concise language, certain general rules of presumptions and burdens of proof for such
cases, just as Sin Nichael Foster attempted to state them in a somewhat different
language, the view taken by Lord Sankey about such statements of the rules found in
English law was: "Rather do I think they simply refer to stages in the trial of a case."
In other words, they are more akin to rules of pleading than to rules determining
quantum of proof. Lord Sankey pointed out that rules of Evidence found in earlier
cases and statements of law are confused. He observed: "It was only later that courts
began to discuss such things as presumption and onus." He also said: "The word onus
is used indifferently throughout the books, sometimes meaning the next move or next
step in the process of proving and sometimes the conclusion." When Lord Sankey
referred to a "statutory exception", he did not mean such general propositions or
principles only, lying partly in the region of rules of pleading and partly of rules of
evidence, which were enacted in Sec. 105 of the Act. What was meant by Lord Sankey,
when he spoke of a "statutory exception", was a real exception to the general principle
of a full burden of proof upon the prosecution. Such an exception, which constitutes a
departure from the general principle, was considered in Rex. V. Carr-Briant17 where a
statutory presumption of corrupt motive arose, "unless the contrary is proved", from a
receipt by the accused of a gift or other consideration from a contractor. This
presumption relieved the prosecution of a part of its duty. But, Sec. 105 of the Act has
no such object or effect.
171. If there could be any doubt whether Sec. 105 conflicts with of subjects the
general
principle contained in Sec. 101 of the Act to an exception, so as to diminish the
prosecution's burden of proof, the very definite pronouncement of our Supreme Court
in K.M. Nanavati V. State of Maharashtra5 has cleared it completely. It was held there:
"The alleged conflict between the general burden which lies on the prosecution and the
special burden imposed on the accused under Sec. 105 of the Evidence Act is more
imaginary than real. Indeed, there is no conflict at all." Woolmington's case was used
here to show identity of principles applied, between our law and English law, in cases
in which exceptions are pleaded. Hence, the Supreme Court declared that the law in
India was the same as that in England on the general principles found in
Woolmington's14 case.
172. Cases dealing with a real statutory exception which does modify the operation
of the principle that the prosecution must prove all the ingredients of the offence with
which the accused is charged do not help us in interpreting Sec. 105 of the Act. For
example, in C.S.D. Swami V. The State4 the character of a presumption of guilt under
Sec. 5 of the Prevention of Corruption Act (1947) from proof of certain facts, "unless
the contrary is proved", was considered. It was held there that the exception laid down
by statute was "a complete departure from the established principle of criminal
jurisprudence that the burden always lies upon the prosecution to prove all the
ingredients of the offence charged and that the burden never shifts on to the accused
to disprove his guilt." V.D. Jhingan V. State of U.P.Â° is also case of a presumption
under Sec. 4 of Prevention of Corruption Act where the accused was obliged, after
proof by the prosecution of facts sufficient to raise the presumption, to disprove his
guilt by leading evidence which could, by a preponderance if probabilities, establish
the defence case. These are cases of presumptions of guilt or of true statutory
exceptions to the principle of a full burden of proof upon the prosecution.
173. In Bhikari V. The State of U.P.6 it was held that, even in a case where insanity
is pleaded, the accused would be entitled to an acquittal if a doubt is created by any
evidence in the case on the question whether the accused had the required mens rea
when he committed the offence. Such a doubt was held to capable of shaking the
prosecution case on an ingredient of the offence with which the accused is charged. It
was also pointed out that "this was very different from saying that the prosecution
must also establish the sanity of the accused" despite Sec. 105 of the Act. The last
mentioned observation could be reconciled with the principle stated first only by
adopting the majority view in Prabhoo's1 case which was that the prosecution was not
called upon to discharge initially any burden of eliminating the exception, although, in
order to satisfy its unshifting stable burden, it had to remove doubts introduced, in the
course of trial, about the ingredients of the offence. The whole, evidence was
examined, including the accused's previous acts and conduct, to overcome possible
doubts. Therefore, this case does not conflict with the majority view in Prabhoo's
case.
174. In Harbhajan Singh V. State of Punjab the Supreme Court, after citing
Woolmington's1 case, held: "The principle of common law is part of the criminal law of
the country. That is not to say that if an exception is pleaded by an accused person, he
is not required to justify his plea; but the degree and character of proof which the
accused is expected to support his plea, cannot be equated with the degree and
character of proof expected from the prosecution which is required to prove its case."
Here, the Supreme Court was really contrasting the lower degree of proof required
from the accused for fully establishing the exception pleaded, by a "preponderance of
probabilities" just like the burden of a party in civil litigation, with the heavier special
burden resting upon the prosecution in a criminal case to prove its case "beyond
reasonable doubt". This was a case in which the accused, having completely justified
his plea of protection, under the ninth exception contained in Sec. 499, in a
prosecution for defamation,
was acquitted. As I have already explained, the majority view in Prabhoo's1 case,
where quite a different problem was before this Court, also was that the accused could
fully establish the exception pleaded by a "preponderance of prebability". The
Supreme Court, in holding here that "as soon as the preponderance of probability is
proved, the burden shifts to the prosecution which has still to discharge its original
onus", evidently took the view, also expressed by the majority in Prabhoo's case, that
Sec. 105 deals with the shifting burden and Sec. 101 with the stable burden. This was
not a case of an equipoised balance of probabilities. Non was it a case, where the
prosecution version, although not improbable, was yet faced with a genuine or serious
doubt. In this, case, the Supreme Court did not really have the problem before it
which was before this Court in Prabhoo's1 case. I, therefore, find no conflict
whatsoever between what was held here by the Supreme Court and the majority view
in Prabhoo's1 case. On the other hand, in my estimation, the views expressed by the
Supreme Court in this case give considerable support, either directly or indirectly, to
the majority view in Prabhoo's1 case.
175. Munshi Ram V. Delhi Administration10 was another case in which the Supreme
Court held that a party which had pleaded an exception (this was a case of private
defence) must succeed due to a demonstration of "preponderance of probabilities" in
favour of its version that right to possession of property was being vindicated
legitmately by it. I find no statement of the law in this case also by their lordships of
the Supreme Court which either expressly or impliedly over-rules or conflicts with the
majority view of his Court in Prabhoo's1 case.
176. In Dahyabhai C. Thakkar V. State of Gujarat- where the plea of insanity of an
accused was rejected their lordships of the Supreme Court practically held what was
held by the majority in Prabhoo's1 case. Several of the very propositions laid down by
the majority in Prabhoo's1 case were expressed hereby the Supreme Court in a some
what different language. It was very explicitly held here that even if the accused does
not succeed in discharging the burden of proving the exception pleaded, he will be
entitled to an acquittal if he is able, with the help of all the material oil the record,
from whichever side it may have come, to show that there is a prudent man's
"reasonable doubt as regards one or other of the necessary ingredients of the offence
itself."
177. I may, however, observe that one question, which was raised and considered
both by the majority and minority of the judges of this Court, in Prabhoo's1 case, has
not engaged the attention of the Supreme Court so far because it does not appear to
have been raised in any case there. That question is whether the presumption under
the last part of Sec. 105, which is obligatory upon a Court, is not removed as soon as
any credible evidence in support of the plea comes on the record. This presumption
imposes a duty upon the court which differs very much from the burden of the
accused, contained in the first part of Sec. 105, to prove his plea. Unless the hands of
the court are freed from any supposed grip or hold of this presumption, by lifting it as
soon as any credible evidence comes on record in support of the exception pleaded by
the accused, the Court would not be in a position to view the evidence as a whole and
give the benefit of doubt to the accused. The presumption would then operate
practically as a rule of exclusion of evidence. It would, in that case, act as a genuine
statutory exception snapping the golden thread of Anglo-Saxon Jurisprudence which
we have adopted as our own.
178. The crux of the problem of construction of Sec. 105 before this Court in
Prabhoo's1 case lay in determining the true scope of the last few words of Sec. 105:
"the court shall presume the absence of such circumstances." That problem is again
before us. The decisions of the Supreme Court, particularly those in Nanavati's5 case
and in Dahyabhai's case1, go a long way in enabling us to resolve the difficulty in the
same way as the majority solved
it in Prabhoo's1 case. I say so because the Supreme Court has held: that, Sec. 105
does not limit or conflict with Sec. 101; that, the accused would get the benefit of
doubt even if he fails to prove his plea by a "preponderance of probability" but
succeeds in casting a doubt on the prosecution version relating to an ingredient of an
offence; that, the hands of the Court are not tied so that it is not legally bound to
convict, even if the accused fails to discharge his burden fully but succeeds in raising a
reasonable doubt (See: Dahyabhai's case, at p. 1568) about his intent in committing
the alleged offence; that, the general law on the question of the fixed or primary
burden of the prosecution, which lasts till the end of the trial and is not curtailed by
Sec. 105, is the same in India as it is in England. These propositions can only hold
good if the same meaning is given to the duty imposed by the obligatory presumption
upon the Court, as contrasted with the burden of the accused, which the majority of
learned Judges of this Court gave to it in Prabhoo's1 case.
179. These are, however, two passages, one in Nanavati's5 case (at pages 616 to
617) and the other in Dahyabhai's case (at p. 1567) which have been quoted fully by
my learned brother D.S. Mathur, J., and the first partly by my learned brother
Mukerjee, J. also, on the strength of which it could be urged that the significance of
the obligatory presumption, contained in the last part of Sec. 105, has also been
considered and pronounced upon by their lordships of the Supreme Court. After having
examined these passages very carefully in the context in which they occur, if seems to
me that the Supreme Court was not interpreting, in either of these two cases, the last
part of Sec. 105 separately and as contrasted or compared with then first part of it.
Although, the scope or the hold of the obligatory presumption on the court under the
last part of Sec. 105 or the situation in which it must be lifted by the court has not
been specifically or directly considered in these cases, yet, it is evident that the
Supreme Court clearly expressed views which necessarily mean that the obligatory
presumption is lifted when there is sufficient material on record to justify giving the
benefit of a reasonable doubt to an accused even if the accused has failed to discharge
his own burden of proving an exception by a preponderance of probabilities.
180. Another difficulty in the way of accepting the correctness of the majority view
in Prabhoo's1 case is said to arise from the threefold division of possible situations
made by the Supreme Court in Nanavati's5 case (at p. 617). We are not concerned
here at all with the first category of cases which do not really require the proof of a
statutory exception by the accused but demand from him a disproof of ingredients of
an offence which are deemed to be established on proof of certain facts justifying the
raising of a statutory presumption (e.g. Secs. 4 and 5 of the Prevention of Corruption
Act). In the second and third types of cases, the accused is required to bring his case
within the exception pleaded by him. The question arises whether, in these cases, the
accused becomes entitled to acquittal when he proves facts or circumstances raising
genuine doubts, or providing reasons to believe that the exception may exist even
though not fully proved. The Supreme Court was not considering the right of private
defence specifically here and did not put it in the second category of cases. But,
dealing with the plea of an accident in the doing of a lawful act in a lawful manner,
covered by the exception found in Sec. 80, I.P.C., it held that the accused could, by
proving only some of the facts necessary to establish the exception to the offence of
culpable homicide, negative the offence or throw a reasonable doubt about the
"intention or the requisite state of mind which is the essence of the offence." In other
words, whenever the facts proved throw the prosecution case into a state of doubt on
"intention or the requisite of state of mind" the ingredients of the offence are affected.
181. Every offence against which a plea of private defence can be taken requires a
state of mind or mens rea on the part of
the accused to be proved by the prosecution. This is usually gathered by
circumstances raising a presumption about the intention. The defence may give some
evidence pointing in another direction. This may actually negative mens rea as was the
case in Amjad Khan V. The State62 where the Supreme Court pointed out that a
resonnable apprehension of death or grievous hurt may justify killing in exercise of a
right of private defence even before an actual attack on a person had commenced. In
some cases, the defence may, while falling short of negativing mens rea, be only able
to show that its existence has become doubtful. In such cases, according to the view
of the majority in Prabhoo's case, the accused would be entitled to an acquittal
because the prosecution has failed to discharge its special burden of eliminating
doubts. The accused may have failed to prove his plea but he gets a benefit which,
whether it is called the benefit of the exception pleaded or of doubt on the whole case,
is available to him only because he has succeeded in throwing the existence of an
ingredient of the offence into the region of reasonable doubt. To constitute any offence
under the I.P.C. there is a mens rea which makes the action complained of criminal or
culpable. In Shiv Ram V. State63 | held, with regard to mens rea: "If the doctrine of
mens rea is, as it no doubt is, elaborately and carefully attempted to be incorporated
throughout the provisions of the Penal Code, 1860, I do not think that this truth is
expressed falicitously at all by saying that the doctrine does not apply to offences
against the Penal Code, 1860." I also held there (at page 201): "In applying this
fundamental doctrine of our criminal jurisprodence to an offence defined by a statute,
when it is applicable, as it is to all offences under the Penal Code, 1860, one has to
assume that there is a mens rea for the offence, and then to proceed, by scanning the
words of the statute, to discover it." To these views I still adhere.
182. The doctrine of mens rea is not abstruse. The principle is stated in the maxim:
"actus non facit reum, nisi mens sit rea" or "an act does not make one guilty unless
the mind is also guilty". In Srinivas V. Emperor23, the Privy Council adopted the rule,
with regard to an alleged violation of Rule 81(2) of Defence of India Rules, that
"unless the statute, either clearly or by necessary implication rules out mens rea as a
constituent part of a crime, a defendant should not be found guilty of an offence
against the criminal law unless he has got a guilty mind." In other words, it is
presumed to exist within or may be impliedly annexed to even a statutory definition of
an offence unless the definition is in terms which necessarily exclude it.
183. A guilty mind, standing by itself, is not punishable under the law although, as
Dr. Johnson's judgment on, the actor Garrick, who said that he felt like a murderer
when acting Richard III-that he should be hanged each time he acted Richard 111-
implied, it may be morally reprehensible. Mens rea as a "state of mind" becomes a
part of a legally punishable offence only when it produce harmful results. It is
manifested by intent, actual or presumed, gathered from acts or omissions which flow
from it. It includes more than an immediate intent to injure. It partly embraces what
falls under motive. As Paton points out ("Text book of jurisprudence" 3rd Ed. p. 275),
the distinction between intention and motive is not always so precise as may appear at
first sight. Even if the distinction made in Salmond's jurisprudence (12th Ed. p. 372),
between motive as the cause or the "ulterior object", which lies behind, and the
immediate intention, which accompanies an act, is accepted, it is clear from Salmond's
own explanation of mens rea as a basis of a criminal liability (See: Salmond's
jurisprudence 12th Ex. p. 366), that wrong motivation overlaps mens rea. "A man is
responsible", wrote Salmond, "not for his acts in themselves but for his acts coupled
with the mens rea or the guilty mind with which he does them.
The guilty mind is not only exhibited or proved by the immediate intent to injure but
also by what may be called an "ulterior intention" actuating the action.
184. Investigation into the nature of intent, both immediate and ulterior or
underlying, is carried out in cases of insanity as well as of accident. An insane person
may form the immediate intention to attack another person due to a delusion that he
was about to be attacked by that other person. If he had an immediate intention to kill
due to such a delusion his incapacity to see fasts as they actually are and to realise
that what he was doing was wrong can only appear, if at all, from evidence other than
that of his intention to injure. The pleas of accident as well as of grave and sudden
provocation were repelled in Nanavati's5 case by examining facts showing an ulterior
or prior intention proved by deliberate preparation. In Dahyabhai's case and Bhikari's
case the alleged incapacity of the accused for mens rea was disbelieved by
investigation "all circumstances which preceded, attended, and followed the crime",
including previous acts and conduct of the accused, indicating a deliberately formed
legally punishable intention.
185. If the ingredients of an offence can be affected in cases of alleged insanity and
accident by reasonable doubts entertained about the motivation or about the totality
of facts affecting intention at the time of commission of the alleged crime, I do not see
why they cannot be similarly affected by findings of reasonable doubt on the question
of the real intent in causing injuries in the course of an alleged exercise of a right of
private defence. The ingredients of each of these pleas will necessarily overlap and
collide with the ingredients of the offence. Mens rea cannot simultaneously be present
and absent. Initially, the prosecution can rely on proof of the actus coupled with the
obligatory presumption at the end of Sec. 105. But, an incompletely established plea
will remove the initial presumption and can not must cast a reasonable doubt on the
existence of mens rea which the prosecution must dispel to succeed. In most cases of
alleged exercise of a right of private defence it is not difficult to arrive at a definite
finding whether the right existed or not. In a genuine case of an exercise of the right
of private defence, the primary intention is to protect from injury and the intent to
injure the aggressor is as much secondary and consequential as the injuries
themselves. Presence or absence of mens rea will be determined in such cases by the
real or ulterior or primary intent. If that intent is to protect and defend, the
consequential intention to injure will not make the act criminal. We cannot confine our
attention to the immediate or consequential intent and forget the real intent for
determining mens rea.
186. There seems to me to be no need to distinguish between the wrongfulness or
guilt of the mind and of the act in a case where a right of private defence is pleaded
because the two must go together in such a case. It is true that causing of injury
during the lawful exercise of a right of private defence is authorised by law just as an
executioner is permitted to hang a condemned man in the discharge of his duty. In
Kenny's "Outlines of Criminal Law" (16th ed. at p. 21) we find: "One who had duly
executed a condemned criminal had effected a homicide which was justifiable; his own
innocence of crime stood really on the basis that the actus was not forbidden (and
therefore not reus), but it could equally well be established by the plea that he had
done nothing wicked nor immoral and therefore had displayed no mens rea". The actus
stands on a separate footing only in exceptional cases. In cases of strict statutory
liability the actus is punishable without the need to prove any mens rea and the only
issue to be decided is whether the actus reus is proved. In a case where a right of
private defence is set up the actus cannot be wrongful or rightful independently of the
existence or absence of mens rea, as explained above. Both intention behind as well
voluntariness in the commission of acts cannot, I believe, be viewed apart from the
whole set of circumstances which produce them.
If injuries are shown to have been caused under the compulsion of events
necessitating acts of private defence, or, it is doubtful whether they were so caused, it
seems to me that belief in the existence of mens rea, which is an essential ingredient
of the offence, is bound to be shaken.
187. I may also observe that the Advocate General conceded that possession of
property may be an essential part of a particular prosecution case which the
prosecution will have to prove in establishing the ingredients of an offence. Here, the
prosecution case will presumably include a charge for criminal trespass under Sec.
441, I.P.C. which requires a very clearly specified intention. And, it is likely that there
will be counter-cases in which each side will claim a right to defend property and
person. A definite finding on possession, which is usually not difficult, decides the fate
of the case of each side in such situations. In very exceptional cases, however, it may
not be possible to determine which side was in possession and which meant to disturb
it. Similarly, there may be exceptional cases where, although no right to possess
property may be involved, it may not be reasonably possible to decide which side had
the primary aggressive intent and which side had the right and primary intent to
defend. I, therefore, hold that cases in which the plea of private defence is taken
would fall in the third category of cases classified by the Supreme Court in Nanavati's5
case so that the plea, even if not fully proved may, when supported by sufficient
evidence, make the prosecution case doubtful on an essential ingredient of the
offence.
188. The views expressed by the Supreme Court and the propositions stated by the
majority of judges of this Court in Prabhoo's1 case will not even appear to be
inconsistent in any way if the factual context and assumptions on which each view
rests are kept in mind. It has been rightly pointed out by Dr. A.L. Goodhart, in a very
elaborate essay on "Determining the Ratio Decidendi of a Case" (See: "Jurisprudence
in Action", 1953, Essays published by the Association of the Bar of New York), that the
principle of a case is determined by taking into account the facts treated by the Judge
as material and his decision "as based thereon". The only criticism of this method,
found in Selmond's Jurisprudence (12th ed. p. 181), is that courts, in their quest for
"the rule which the judge thought himself to be applying", tend to ignore it in practice.
But, it was stated there: "any such rule must be evaluated in the light of facts
considered by the Court to be material". Our Supreme Court certainly adopted the
method, in Andhra Sugars Ltd. V. State of A.P.64, when it held that a passage in a
previous decision, which appeared to lay down a rule, "must be read with the facts of
the case". If this method is followed, no conflict whatsoever between anything laid
down by the Supreme Court and what was held by the majority in Prabhoo's case will
even seem to arise.
189. I may now refer to an argument advanced by Mr. P.C. Chaturvedi, the learned
counsel for the accused, relying on Otto George Gfeller V. The King11. It was contended
that the optional presumption arising under Sec. 114, Illustration (a), which can be
rebutted by merely offering a reasonable explanation, such as the accused may give in
his statement under Sec. 342 of the Criminal Procedure Code, accounting for recent
possession of stolen goods, results in a situation which is exactly similar to that which
arises from the obligatory presumption under the last part of Sec. 105 of the Act after
the optional presumption has been raised. The submission was that the obligatory
presumption can also be similarly rebutted by a reasonable explanation. The flaw in
this argument is that the particular optional presumption under Sec. 114 of the Act is
a conditional presumption which will not arise at all if there is a reasonable
explanation, whereas the rebuttable obligatory presumption under Sec. 105 operates
always and invariably at the outset and is removed only by proof of some circumstance
or circumstances, and not by a plausible explanation
only. The conditional presumption under Sec. 114, when raised, goes the whole length
of proving the guilt of the accused. The gap it will cover, when raised, is either of proof
of intention in removing property or of proof of knowledge of the stolen character of
goods. Where the explanation is accepted, the optional presumption is not raised at all
and the prosecution will fail on the ground that an ingredient of the offence charged
has not been proved. On the other hand, the accused may be convicted even if the
obligatory presumption under the last part of Sec. 105 of the Act is removed. The
learned counsel for the accused also erroneously assumed, in putting forward this
argument, that the accused must be deemed to have discharged his onus of proving
an exception as soon as the initial obligatory presumption at the end of Sec. 105 is
lifted. However, the conditional optional presumption under Sec. 114 can be used to
illustrate how various presumptions differ in function and application.
190. The common factor which operates in using a presumption, whether optional
or obligatory, is the prudence and reasonableness which the Court is expected to
employ. This is not defined by any provision dealing with a burden of proof or a
presumption although the illustration given in Sec. 114 indicate what it requires. It is
only broadly defined by Sec. 3 of the Act. It covers a proof by preponderance of
probability, where this is enough, and, in a criminal trial, also the higher degree of
proof, by eliminating reasonable doubt, which the prosecution must provide.
191. Even a literal interpretation of the first part of Sec. 105 could indicate that
"the burden of proving the existence of circumstances bringing the case within" an
exception is meant to cover complete proof of the exception pleaded, by a
preponderance of probability, as well as proof of circumstances showing that the
exception may exist which will entitle the accused to the benefit of doubt on the
ingredients of an offence. If the intention was to confine the benefit of brining a case
within an exception to cases where the exception was established by a preponderance
of probability, more direct and definite language would have been employed by
providing that the accused must "prove the existence" of the exception pleaded. But,
the language used in the first part of Sec. 105 seems to be deliberately less precise so
that the accused, even if he fails to discharge his duty fully, by establishing the
existence of an exception, may get the benefit of the exception indirectly when the
prosecution fails in its duty to eliminate genuine doubt about his guilt introduced by
the accused. Again, the last part of Sec. 105, even if strictly and literally interpreted,
does not justify reading into it the meaning that the obligatory presumption must last
until the accused's plea is fully established and not just till circumstances (i.e. not
necessarily all) to support the plea are proved. Moreover, a restrictive interpretation of
Sec. 105, excluding an accused from the benefit of bringing his case within an
exception until he fully proves it, is ruled out by the declaration of law by the Supreme
Court that there is no conflict between Sec. 105 and the prosecution's duty to prove
its case beyond reasonable doubt. Hence, the obligatory presumption, at the end of
Sec. 105, cannot be held to last until the accused proves his exception fully by a
preponderance of probability. It is necessarily removed earlier or operates only initially
as held clearly by judges taking the majority view in Prabhoo's1 case.
192. My view, therefore, is that, in cases where the accused plead exceptions, the
obligatory presumption is lifted as soon as there is some evidence to support the plea.
The accused may carry his plea further and succeed in creating a reasonable doubt
about an ingredient of an offence. The prosecution will have to remove this doubt,
possibly in the course of argument, to succeed after this. In other cases, the accused
may have carried his case still further and established his plea by a preponderance of
probabilities. Although, there is no provision in our Criminal Procedure Code for
production of evidence in rebuttal by the prosecution, as of right, after the accused
has established: an exception by a
preponderance of probability, yet, it is conceivable that, in exceptional cases, the
prosecution may be able to demolish the defence case, even after it is fully proved, by
some rebutting evidence which the Court is persuaded to admit under Sec. 540,
Criminal Procedure Code, in exercise of the court's power to decide the case justly
after finding out the whole truth. For example, the prosecution may be able to prove
that a doctor, who had given evidence of the injuries on the accused, had undoubtedly
fabricated evidence. Ultimately, these stages become parts of a single psychological
process of appraisement of evidence as a whole which the judge goes through in his
mind when considering, sifting, weighing, comparing, and testing the prosecution and
defence versions and evidence, placed side by side, with a view to pronouncing his
judgment. At this stage, the obligatory presumption under Sec. 105 cannot stand in
the way of an acquittal if evidence in the case justifies giving the accused the benefit
of reasonable doubt on the charge.
193. The obligatory presumption thus fits into the whole procedural machinery
regulating a criminal trial in this country only as a sort of proviso, inserted almost
parenthetically by way of abundant caution, so as to prevent courts from imagining
circumstances in support of exceptions pleaded when they are unsupported by any
proved circumstances. Its function does not extend to obstructing courts performing
their duties to give effect to genuine doubts which may arise from facts proved. Its
purpose and meaning can only be fully understood in the context of the whole scheme
for the adduction of evidence in a criminal trial. Torn from this context it can operate
only as a stumbling block and not as the aid to justice which it was, I have no doubt
whatsoever, meant to be.
194. The duty and power of the court to find out the truth in a criminal case,
independently of the duties which devolve on the parties to adduce their evidence, are
exemplified by Sec. 540, Criminal Procedure Code. This additional duty of the court to
ascertain the truth more accurately when trying a criminal case as compared with the
duty in the trial of a civil case, could not be discharged satisfactorily unless it had the
power to give the benefit of a reasonable doubt to the accused. Our Evidence Act has
clearly provided for three kinds of conclusions a court may arrive at. The negative
conclusion, falling under "not proved", reminds one of the verdict "not proven" which a
jury may return in Scotland as an alternative to either of the two other verdicts,
"guilty" or "not guilty", which are the only ones open to a jury in England. In England,
however, the verdict of "not guilty" covers a case in which the prosecution has failed to
prove its case "beyond reasonable doubt" as well as a case where an accused pleading
an exception establishes it fully so that the prosecution case is disproved.
195. The Advocate General also raised the question whether the principle of benefit
of doubt, accepted in England as a matter of public policy the ground upon which it
was placed by Lord Hailsham in Sodeman V. R.16-was available to the accused on the
same grounds or to the same extent in this country. The learned counsel for the
accused answered this argument by pointing out that, irrespective of the ground on
which this principle should be accepted, it must have the same force in India as in
England after the final pronouncement of the Supreme Court on this matter. I may
observe that Sodeman's case, citing observations of Duff, J., has been mentioned
with approval by their lordships of the Supreme Court in Harbhajan Singh's case. (at
p. 102). Speaking for myself, I do not see why principles of public policy or
consideration of consequences of taking a particular view should not affect the
interpretation to be given to statutory provisions dealing with basic norms when two
interpretations of a statutory provision are open. Acting in this manner would not be
legislation but an operation within the "interstices of the Statute". I do not see why
the principle of benefit of doubt deserves, either on grounds of public policy, or as a
part of the concept of fair trial in a criminal case, to be given less recognition or force
in this
country. Methods of investigation of crime available to the prosecuting authorities in
this country are still rudimentary and have not reached the level of scientific precision
which they have attained in other countries. Powerful motives and factors come into
play to conceal the actual offenders and to mislead prosecuting authorities in criminal
cases every where. The adoption of short cuts by producing perjured evidence in
support of hastily arrived at conclusions of prosecuting authorities are not less
common in this country than elsewhere. However, I am content to base my opinion on
this question on the strength of the declaration of law by the Supreme Court that the
principle of benefit of doubt has the same force in this country as it has in England.
Accused persons in this country are not entitled to a lesser protection than the
accused in England when the Constitution itself protects life and liberty here against
deprivation except one in accordance with the procedure prescribed by law. The
meaning of our procedural or adjectival laws must, therefore, be determined in
conformity with firmly established notions of a fair trial unless some statutory
provision clearly sanctions a departure from these.
196. As the answer given by the majority of the learned judges in Prabhoo's1 case
accords with the basic principles, embodied in Secs. 3 and 101 and 103 and 105 of
the Act, as explained by their lordships of the Supreme Court, it is not necessary for
me to discuss authorities of other High Courts cited before us which have been
referred to fully by my learned brother D.S. Mathur, J.
197. I may also mention that although Prabhoo's1 case does not appear to have
been specifically referred to by the Supreme Court so far and this, according to the
Advocate General, was also significant their lordships did cite with approval, in
Dahyabhai's case a decision of a Division Bench of the Patna High Court in Kamla
Singh V. State38 where reliance was placed on the majority decision in Prabhoo's case.
Kamla Singh's3 case was mentioned by the Supreme Court because, just as in
Dahyabhai's case, the plea of insanity as an exception was raised there. The precise
problem considered in Prabhoo's1 case and the answer given there have not, so far as I
am aware, come up for consideration before the Supreme Court in relation to the right
of private defence.
198. After a close scrutiny of every part of each of the seven opinions in Prabhoo's1
case I have come to the conclusion that the majority of their lordships did not lay
down anything beyond three important propositions which, if not either directly or
indirectly supported by decisions of their lordships of the Supreme Court, have not
been affected in the slightest degree by these decisions. These propositions are:
firstly, that no evidence appearing in the case to support the exception pleaded by the
accused can be excluded altogether from consideration on the ground that the accused
has not proved his plea fully; secondly, that the obligatory presumption at the end of
Sec. 105 is necessarily lifted atleast when there is enough evidence on record to
justify giving the benefit of doubt to the accused on the question whether he is guilty
of the offence with which he is charged; and, thirdly, if the doubt, though raised due
to
evidence in support of the exception pleaded, is reasonable and affects an
ingredient of the offence with which the accused is charged, the accused would be
entitled to an acquittal. As I read the answer of the majority in Prabhoo's1 case, I find
it based on these three propositions-which provide the ratio decidendi-and this is all
that needs "to be clarified.
199. The practical result of the three propositions stated above is that an accused's
plea of an exception may reach one of three not sharply demarcated stages, one
succeeding the other, depending upon the effect of the whole evidence in the case
judged by the standard of a prudent man weighing or balancing probabilities carefully.
These stages are: firstly, a lifting of the initial obligatory presumption given at the end
of Sec. 105 of the Act; secondly, the creation of a reasonable doubt about the
existence of an ingredient of the offence;
and, thirdly, a complete proof of the exception by "a preponderance of probability",
which covers even a slight tilt of the balance of probability in favour of the accused's
plea. The accused is not entitled to an acquittal if his plea does not get beyond the
first stage. At the second stage, he becomes entitled to acquittal by obtaining a bare
benefit of doubt. At the third stage, he is undoubtedly entitled to an acquittal. This, in
my opinion, is the effect of the majority view in Prabhoo's case which directly relates
to first two stages only. The Supreme Court decisions have considered, the last two
stages so far, but the first stage has not yet been dealt with directly or separately
there in any case brought to our notice.
200. The last two preceding paragraphs, which summarise my opinion, would have
been enough to answer the question before us if it had not been urged so
emphatically, on behalf of the State, that the majority view in Prabhoo's1 case
overlooks important aspects of the question, which were more fully argued before us
with the help of Supreme Court decisions, and that trial courts need detailed guidance
on the application of the principle of Benefit of Doubt when exceptions are pleaded.
After having anxiously examined every aspect of the question referred to us, I answer
the question framed, in complete agreement with the conclusions of my learned
brethren Broome, Gupta, Gyanendra Kumar, Yashoda Nandan and Parekh, JJ., as
follows: -
The answer of the majority of learned Judges who decided Prabhoo V. Emperor1 is
still good law. It means that in a case in which, in answer to a prima facie
prosecution case, any general exception in the Penal Code, 1860 is pleaded by an
accused and evidence is adduced to support such a plea, but such evidence fails to
satisfy the Court affirmatively that the accused has fully established his plea, he will
still be entitled to an acquittal, provided that, after weighing the evidence as a
whole prudently (including the evidence given in support of the plea of the said
general exception), the Court reaches the conclusion that, as a consequence of the
doubt arising about the existence of the exception. the prosecution has failed to
discharge its onus of proving the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt.
201. MUKERJEE, J.: I am in respectful agreement with the views expressed by my
Lord the Chief Justice that the statement of law in Prabhoo's case is not accurate. I
would like to add a short few words.
202. The answer to the question referred to this Full Bench should follow from a
correct interpretation of Sec. 105, Sec. 4 and Sec. 3 of the Indian Evidence Act. The
terms of these Sections have been quoted in the judgment of my Lord the Chief
Justice and I do not reproduce them here to avoid repetition.
203. The effect of Sec. 105, read with Secs. 3 and 4 of the Indian Evidence Act,
was considered by the Supreme Court in the case of K.M. Nanavati V. State of
Maharashtra. (At page 616) Subba Rao, J., (as he then was) observed as follows: -
"The legal inpact of the said provisions on the question of burden of proof may be
stated thus: In India, as it is in England there is a presumption of innocence in
favour of the accused as a general rule and it is the duty of the prosecution to prove
the guilt of the accused; to put it in other words, the accused is presumed to be
innocent until his guilt is established by the prosecution. But when an accused
relies upon the General Exceptions in the Penal Code, 1860 or on any special
exception or proviso contained in any other part of the Penal Code, or in any law
defining an offence, Sec. 105 of the Evidence Act raises a presumption against the
accused and also throws a burden on him to rebut the said presumption. Under that
section the Court shall presume the absence of circumstances bringing the case
within any of the exceptions, that is, the Court shall regard the non-existence of
such circumstances as proved till they are disproved."
204. Clearly, the incidence of the burden of proving an exception under Sec. 105 of
the Indian Evidence Act is on the accused person
and this was conceded by Mr. Chaturvedi. The crucial question for determination is, as
pointed out by my Lord the Chief Justice, how the burden may be rebutted by the
accused. Sec. 105 says that the Court shall presume the non-existence of
circumstances bringing the case within the exception proved until "disproved". In view
of the catagorical terms of the definition of the word "disproved" as given in Sec. 3 of
the Indian Evidence Act, it is manifest that the accused person cannot succeed by
merely creating a reasonable doubt in the mind of the Court as to whether he is or is
not entitled to the benefit of the said exception. A presumption of law cannot be
succesefully rebutted by merely raising a doubt, however reasonable. Something more
than raising a reasonable doubt is required for rebutting a presumption of law and it is
necessary for the accused to show that his explanation is so probable that a prudent
man ought, in the circumstances, to accept it.
205. The Advocate General frankly conceded that the burden on the accused of
proving an exception is lighter than the burden which lies on the prosecution of
establishing the guilt of the accused. In Harbhajan Singh V. State of Punjab the
Supreme Court observed;
"Where an accused person is called to prove that his case falls under an exception,
law treats that onus as discharged if the accused succeeds in proving a
preponderance of probability. The onus on an accused person may well be
compared to the onus on a party in civil proceedings
206. In a criminal proceeding the prosecution has to prove the guilt of an accused
person beyond reasonable doubt but in a civil proceeding a party succeeds on the
balance of probabilities. The distinction in the standard of proof in the two classes of
cases cannot, I think, be better expressed than by quoting from the judgment of
Denning, J., in Hiller V. Minister of Pensions65 (Not cited at the bar). Speaking of the
degree of proof required in a criminal case before an accused person is found guilty,
Denning, J., stated:-
"That degree is well settled. It need not reach certainty but it must reach a high
degree of probability. Proof beyond reasonable doubt does not mean proof beyond
the shadow of a doubt. The law would fail to protect the community if it admitted
fanciful possibilities to deflect the course of justice. If the evidence is so strong
against a man as to leave only a remote possibility in his favour which can be
dismissed with the sentence "Of course, it is possible but not in the least probable,
the case is proved beyond reasonable doubt..
"
207. As regards the degree of cogency required to discharge a burden in a civil
case, his Lordship stated:
"That degree is well-settled. It must carry a reasonable degree of probability, but
not so high as is required in a criminal case. If the evidence is such that the
tribunal can say: 'We think it more probable than not", the burden is discharged
but if the probabilities are equal, it is not". (Italicised by me).
208. The burden on an accused person being the same as the burden on a party in
a civil proceeding, it follows that if the balance of probabilities supports the plea of
exception the burden on the accused person is discharged but if the court is left in a
state of reasonable doubt as to whether the accused person is or is not entitled to the
benefit of the said exception, it would be a case where the probabilities are equal and,
having regard to what Denning, J. has laid down, the plea would fail.
209. However, as pointed out by my Lord the Chief Justice, the nature of the case
is such that, on the totality of evidence, a reasonable doubt arises as regards some
ingredient of the offence, the accused person is entitled to an acquittal; in other cases,
a reasonable doubt as regards the exception claimed will not entitle him to an
acquittal.
210. By The Court-In accordance with the majority opinion, our answer to the
question
referred to this Full Bench is as follows:-
The majority decision in 'Prabhoo V. Emperor1 is still good law. The accused person
is entitled to be acquitted if upon a consideration of the evidence as a whole
(including the evidence given in support of the plea of the general exception) a
reasonable doubt is created in the mind of the Court about the guilt of the accused.
