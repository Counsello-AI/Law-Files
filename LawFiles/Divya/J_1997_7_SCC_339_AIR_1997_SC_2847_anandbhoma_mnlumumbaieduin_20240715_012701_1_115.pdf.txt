A. Constitution of India - Arts. 289, 246(4), 245(1) and 1(2), (3)(b) -
'Union taxation' - Immunity of instrumentalities - Property of States
situated in Union Territory viz. National Capital Territory of Delhi - Whether
exempt from Union taxation - Whether Union Territories are State or part
of the Union - Held, per curiam, Union Territories, such as NCT, are part of
the Union and not part of any State - Definition of State under S. 3(58) of
General Clauses Act not applicable - Hence property tax levied by
municipalities within NCT under the Punjab Municipal Act, 1911 (as
extended and applied by Part 'C' State Laws Act, 1950), the New Delhi
Municipal Council Act, 1994 and the Delhi Municipal Corporation Act, 1957
constitute "Union taxation" within the meaning of clause (1) of Article 289
of the Constitution of India - Held, per Jeevan Reddy, Anand, Sen,
Paripoornan and Kirpal, JJ., levy of property tax on such lands/buildings
which are not used or occupied for the purposes of any trade or business
carried on by State Govt. with profit motive invalid and incompetent by
virtue of Art. 289(1) - But if levy is on lands/buildings used or occupied for
any trade or business carried on by or on behalf of the State Govts., then by
virtue of Art. 289(2), levy would be valid - It is for the authorities under
the said enactments to determine with notice to the affected State
Governments, which land or building is used or occupied for the purposes of
any trade or business carried on by or on behalf of that State Government
- Per Ahmadi, C.J. and Verma, Agrawal and Hansaria, JJ., (contra) States
entitled to exemption from levy of property tax on their lands/buildings
situated within NCT including those occupied for trade or business purposes
- Municipalities - Punjab Municipal Act, 1911 (3 of 1911) - Delhi Municipal
Corporation Act, 1957 (66 of 1957) - New Delhi Municipal Council Act,
1994 (44 of 1994) - General Clauses Act, 1897, S. 3(58)
B. Constitution of India - Art. 289 - Interrelation between cls. (1), (2)
and (3) - Exemption from Union taxation of property and income of State
under cl. (1) - Per curiam, is not absolute - CI. (1) has to be read in the
context of cls. (2) and (3) - While cl. (2) is an exception to cl. (1), cl. (3) is an
exception to cl. (2)
C. Constitution of India - Art. 289(2) - Per curiam, by virtue of cl. (2)
trading and business activities of State Governments, which are carried on
with the profit motive, will be liable to tax and they cannot avail of the
exemptions in cl. (1) - If a parliamentary law within the meaning of cl. (2)
of Art. 289 is made, the area covered by that law would be removed from
the field occupied in cl. (1) - However, such a removal is not automatic and
is dependent upon the enactment of a parliamentary law which imposes
taxes on specified trading and business activities of State Governments -
Expressions 'trade' and 'business' - Meaning and scope - Compared with
`governmental activity' - Words and phrases
D. Constitution of India - Art. 289(2) - Whether Parliament in exercise
of powers under cl. (2) imposed tax on trading and business activities of
State Govts. within National Capital Territory of Delhi - Nature and effect of
Delhi Municipal Corporation Act, Punjab Municipal Act as extended and
applied by Part 'C' State Laws Act and New Delhi Municipal Council Act -
While these enactments contain specific exemptions in favour of properties
of the Union and also exempt properties used for "charitable purposes" and
"public worship", they do not exempt properties of State Governments -
Held, per Jeevan Reddy, Anand, Sen, Paripoornan & Kirpal, JJ., omission to
exempt properties of State Govt. must be deemed to be deliberate - In
this situation doctrine of presumption of constitutionality of legislations
points in favour of holding that the Punjab Municipal Act and NDMC Act and
the Delhi Municipal Corporation Act are laws made by Parliament under
Article 289(2), and taxes imposed by them upon the properties occupied for
trading and business activities by State Governments would be valid and
effective - Held, per Ahmadi, C.J., Verma, Agrawal & Hansaria, JJ., Punjab
Municipal Act, 1911 and Delhi Municipal Corporation Act are not
parliamentary laws in the sense envisaged by Art. 289(2) - They do not
expressly purport to have been made under cl. (2) - Power to tax is not
automatic and responsibility of specifying the trading and business activities
of State Govts. which would be liable to Union taxation is expressly vested
in Parliament - Punjab Municipal Act, 1911 which is a pre-constitutional
colonial legislation and Delhi Municipal Corporation Act are ordinary municipal
legislations - Therefore, these enactments are incapable of levying tax on
property, whether occupied for governmental or trading purposes of State
Govt. - Municipalities - Punjab Municipal Act, 1911 (3 of 1911) - Delhi
Municipal Corporation Act, 1957 (66 of 1957) - New Delhi Municipal Council
Act, 1994 (44 of 1994)
E. Constitution of India - Arts. 285(1) & 289(1) - Compared - Inter-
governmental immunity envisaged under, explained
F. Constitution of India - Art. 246(4) - Parliament can make laws in
respect of Union Territories under - Definition in S. 3(58), General Clauses
Act, inapplicable - General Clauses Act, 1897, S. (58)
G. Interpretation of Statutes - Presumption - Doctrine of presumption
of constitutionality of legislation - Applicability - Limitation - Where
the
enactment can be related to and upheld with reference to some
constitutional provision, its validity should be upheld (Per Jeevan Reddy,
Anand, Sen, Paripoornan and Kirpal, JJ.) - In order to save a statutory
provision by applying the doctrine, unnatural and forced meaning should not
be ascribed (Ahmadi, C.J., Verma, Agrawal & Hansaria, JJ.)
H. Practice and Procedure - Pleadings - Fact that a party or Govt. does
not choose to raise an argument cannot be a ground for the court not to
declare
the correct position of law (Per Jeevan Reddy, Anand, Sen, Paripoornan and Kirpal,
JJ.) - Where a contention has not been advanced, either in written pleadings or in
oral submissions, it should not be dealt with because the opposite side had no
opportunity to answer the line of reasoning adopted in that behalf (Per Ahmadi,
C.J., Verma, Agarwal & Hansaria, JJ.)
I. Constitution of India - Arts. 265, 245 and 246 - Power to tax is an
incident of sovereignty
J. Constitution of India - Arts. 239-AA and 1(2) & (3)(b) and Sch. I -
National Capital Territory of Delhi (NCT) is yet a Union Territory
K. Statute Law - Extension of an Act - Held, has the same effect as if
that Act has been made by the extending legislature for that area - Punjab
Municipal Act, 1911 as extended to Delhi by Part 'C' State (Laws) Act, 1950
would amount to a parliamentary enactment - Constitution of India, Arts.
245 and 246
L. Constitution of India - Art. 289(1) - Expression "property" in, covers
not only lands and buildings but all forms of property - Both property and
income derived form it of the States are exempt under Art. 289(1) subject
to Art. 289(2) (Per Jeevan Reddy, Anand, Sen, Paripoornan and Kirpal, JJ.)
M. Municipalities - Municipal taxes - Generally - Municipalities do not
have plenary power to tax and depend upon their parent legislatures for
bestowing such power - Constitution of India, Arts. 245, 246 and 265
Held :
Per Jeevan Reddy, Anand, Sen, Paripoornan and Kirpal, JJ.
(1) A Federation presupposes two coalescing units : the Federal
Government/Centre and the States/Provinces. Each is supposed to be supreme in
the sphere allotted to it/them. Power to tax is an incident of sovereignty. Basic
premise is that one sovereign cannot tax the other sovereign. Articles 285 and 289
manifest this mutual regard and immunity but in a manner peculiar to our
constitutional scheme. While the immunity created in favour of the Union is
absolute, the immunity created in favour of the States is a qualified one.
(Para 147)
The crucial question arising in this batch of appeals pertains to the meaning of
the expression "Union taxation" occurring in Article 289(1). The States put together
do not exhaust the territory of India. There are certain territories which do not form
part of any State and yet are the territories of the Union. That the States and
Union Territories are different entities, is evident from clause (2) of Article 1 -
indeed from the entire scheme of the Constitution. Article 1(2) read with Article 245
(1) shows that so far as the Union Territories are concerned, the only law-making
body is Parliament. The legislature of a State cannot make any law for a Union
Territory; it can make laws only for that State. Clauses (1), (2) and (3) of Article
246 speak of division of legislative powers between Parliament and State
legislatures. This division is only between Parliament and the State legislatures, i.e.,
between the Union and the States. There is no division of legislative powers
between the Union and Union Territories. Similarly, there is no division of powers
between States and Union Territories. So far as the Union Territories are concerned,
it is clause (4) of Article 246 that is relevant. A reference to Article 239-B read with
clause (8) of Article 239-AA shows how the Union Territory of Delhi is in a class by
itself but is certainly not a State within the meaning of Article 246 or Part VI of the
Constitution. In sum, it is also a territory governed by clause (4) of Article 246.
Article 246(4) says that Parliament has the power to make laws with respect to
any matter for any part of the territory of India not included in a State
notwithstanding that such matter is a matter enumerated in the State List. Since,
the Union Territory is not included in the territory of any State, Parliament is the
only law-making body available for such Union Territories. So far as the Union
Territories are concerned, there is no such thing as List I, List II or List III. The only
legislative body is Parliament - or a legislative body created by it. Parliament can
make any law in respect of the said territories - subject, of course, to
constitutional limitations other than those specified in Chapter I of Part XI of the
Constitution. Above all. the Union Territories are not "States" as contemplated bv
Chapter I of Part XI; they are the territories of the Union falling outside the
territories of the States. Once the Union Territory is a part of the Union and not part
of any State, it follows that any tax levied by its legislative body is Union taxation.
Admittedly, it cannot be called "State taxation" - and under the constitutional
scheme, there is no third kind of taxation. Either it is Union taxation or State
taxation.

Various Union Territories are in different stages of evolution. Some have already
acquired Statehood and some may be on the way to it. The fact, however, remains
that those surviving as Union Territories are governed by Article 246(4)
notwithstanding the differences in their respective set-ups - and Delhi, now called
the "National Capital Territory of Delhi", is yet a Union Territory.
(Para 155)
Articles 249, 250 and 357 are exceptional situations which call for Parliament to
step in and make laws in respect of matters enumerated in List II and which laws
have effect for a limited period. Article 252 is a case where the State Legislatures
themselves invite Parliament to make a law on their behalf. These are all situations
of what may be called "substitute legislation" - either because of a particular
situation or because there is no legislature at a given moment to enact laws. As
against these provisions, clause (4) of Article 246 is a permanent feature and laws
made thereunder are laws made in the regular course.
(Para 154)
It is not necessary to refer to or discuss the propositions laid down in Advance
Insurance Co. Ltd. V. Gurudasmal holding that the amended definition of "State" in
clause (58) of Section 3 of the General Clauses Act applies to interpretation of
Constitution by virtue of Article 372-A nor with the contrary proposition in the
659 : SCR at p. 313). It is enough to say that context of Article 246 - indeed of
Chapter I in Part XI - excludes the application of the said amended definition.

The Delhi Municipal Corporation Act, 1957 was enacted by Parliament. Hence, so
far as the Delhi Municipal Corporation area is concerned, the taxes are levied under

and by virtue of a parliamentary enactment. So far as the New Delhi Municipal
Council area is concerned, the taxes were levied till 1994 under the Punjab Municipal
Act, 1911 as extended and applied by the Part 'C' State (Laws) Act, 1950 enacted
by Parliament. Extension of an Act to an area has the same effect as if that Act has
been made by the extending legislature for the area. It must accordingly be held
that with effect from 1950, it is as if the property taxes are levied by a
parliamentary enactment. In 1994, of course, Parliament itself enacted the New
Delhi Municipal Council Act (with effect from 25-5-1994) repealing the Punjab
Municipal Act. Taxes levied under these enactments cannot but be Union taxation -
Union taxation in a Union Territory. Thus the levy of taxes on property by the
Punjab Municipal Act, 1911 [as extended to Part 'C' State of Delhi by Part 'C' States
(Laws) Act, 1950], the Delhi Municipal Corporation Act, 1957 and the
New Delhi Municipal Council Act, 1994 (both parliamentary enactments) constitutes
"Union taxation" within the meaning of Article 289(1).

(2) Clause (1) of Article 289 cannot be looked at in isolation; it must be read
subject to clause (2). All the three clauses of Article 289 are parts of one single
scheme. Clause (2) is an exception to clause (1) and clause (3) is an exception to
clause (2). When a claim for exemption is made under clause (1) of Article 289, the
Court has to examine and determine the field occupied by clause (1) by reading
clauses (1) and (2) together. If there is a law made by Parliament within the
meaning of clause (2), the area covered by that law will be removed from the field
occupied by clause (1). The exemption provided by Article 289(1) is a qualified one
- qualified by clause (2). It is not an absolute exemption like the one provided by
Article 285(1). If there is a law within the meaning of clause (2), the field occupied
by clause (1) gets curtailed to the extent specified in clause (2) and the law made
thereunder. Under clause (2) of Article 289 removal of exemption is not automatic;
it comes about only when Parliament makes a law imposing taxes in respect of any
trade or business carried on by a State Government and all activities connected
therewith or any property used or occupied for the purposes of such business as
also the income derived therefrom. If any property - whether moveable or
immovable - is used or occupied for the purpose of any such trade or business, it
can be denied the exemption provided by clause (1) but this denial can be only by
way of a law made by Parliament. Also the exception contemplated by clause (2) is
not confined to trade and business carried on by a State outside its territory. Even
the trade or business carried on by a State within its own territory can also be
brought within the purview of the enactment made (by Parliament) in terms of the
said clause.
(Paras 175, 166 and 174)
In the light of the language of the proviso to Section 155 of the Government of
India Act, 1935 and clause (2) of Article 289, it is not possible to say that every
activity carried on by the Government is governmental activity. A distinction has to
be made between governmental activity and trade and business carried on by the
Government, at least for the purposes of this clause. Unless an activity in the
nature of trade and business is carried on with a profit motive, it would not be a
trade or business contemplated by clause (2). Where there is no profit motive
involved in any activity carried on by the State Government, it cannot be said to be
carrying on a trade or business within the meaning of the proviso/clause (2),
merely because some profit results from the activity. Both the words 'trade' and
'business' import substantially the same idea though, ordinarily speaking, the
expression "business" appears to be wider in its content. The expression, however,
has no definite meaning; its meaning varies with the context and several other
factors. Having regard to the context in which the words "trade or business" occur
- whether in the proviso to Section 155 of the Government of India Act, 1935 or
in clause (2) of Article 289 of our Constitution - they must be given, a restricted
meaning, the context being levy of tax by one unit of federation upon the income of
the other unit, the manifold activities carried on by Governments under our
constitutional scheme, the necessity to maintain a balance between the Centre and
the States and so on.

As against the words "lands and buildings" belonging to a Provincial Government
in Section 155 of the Government of India Act, 1935, Article 289(1) uses a single
expression "property" and says that property of a State shall be exempt from
Union taxation. The expression "property" is indubitably much wider. It takes in not
only lands and buildings but all forms of property. Both Section 155(1) and Article
289(1) exempt the income as well derived by a Provincial Government/State
Government from Union taxation. Both the property and income of the States are
thus exempt under clause (1) of Article 289 subject, of course, to clause (2)
thereof.
(Paras 171 and 172)
Question is whether the Punjab Municipal Act, the Delhi Municipal Corporation Act
and the NDMC Act are or can be deemed to be enactments within the meaning of
clause (2) of Article 289. These enactments - and certainly the Delhi Municipal
Corporation Act and the NDMC Act - are post-constitutional enactments. These
enactments while specifically exempting the Union properties in terms of Article
285, do not exempt the properties of the States in terms of Article 289. The
omission cannot be said to be unintentional - particularly in the case of Delhi
Municipal Corporation Act and the NDMC Act. The intention is clear and obvious :
the enactments do not wish to provide for any exemption in favour of properties of
the States situated within their respective jurisdictions. Taxes are levied on all
properties within their jurisdiction (except the properties specifically exempted),
irrespective of who owns them and to what use they are put.
(Paras 175, 164 and 166)
Therefore, the levy of property taxes under the aforesaid enactments on lands
and/or buildings belonging to the State Governments is invalid and incompetent by
virtue of the mandate contained in clause (1) of Article 289. In such a situation, the
question is, how should they be understood? Two views can be taken : one that
since the said enactments do not expressly purport to have been made under and
as contemplated by clause (2) of Article 289, they should not be read and
understood as laws contemplated by or within the meaning of the said clause (2).
The effect of this view would be that the properties of the State in the Union
Territory of Delhi will be totally exempt irrespective of the manner of their use and
occupation. In other words, the consequence would be that the relevant provisions
of the said enactments would be ineffective and unenforceable against all the
properties held by the States in the Union Territory/National Capital Territory of
Delhi, irrespective of the nature of their user or occupation. The second view is that
since there is always a presumption of constitutionality in favour of the statutes and
also because the declaration of invalidity or inapplicability of a statute should be only
to the extent the enactment is clearly outside the legislative competence of the
legislative body making it or is squarely covered by the ban or prohibition in
question, the declaration of invalidity should not extend to the extent the
enactments can be related to and upheld with reference to some constitutional
provision, even though not cited by or recited in the enactment. Similarly, the
declaration of inapplicability should only be to the extent the law is plainly covered
by the ban or prohibition, as the case may be. What is not covered by the
constitutional bar should be held to be applicable and effective. The latter view is
consistent with the well-known principles of constitutional interpretation and should
be preferred. If the law had expressly stated that it is a law made under and with
reference to clause (2) of Article 289, no further question would have arisen. The
only question is where it does not say so, can its validity or applicability be
sustained with reference to clause (2). It must be
held that it should be so sustained, even though it may be that the appellant-
corporations have not chosen to argue this point specifically. The fact that a party
or a Government does not choose to put forward an argument cannot be a ground
for the court not to declare the correct position in law. The taxes levied by the
aforesaid enactments do constitute "Union taxation" within the meaning of clause
(1) of Article 289 and by virtue of the exemption provided by clause (1), taxes are
not leviable on State properties. In view of the fact that clauses (1) and (2) of
Article 289 go together, form part of one scheme and have to be read together,
the operation and applicability of clause (2) cannot be ignored.

Therefore, it must be held that the levy of property taxes by the said
enactments is valid to the extent it relates to lands and buildings owned by State
Governments and used or occupied for the purposes of any trade or business
carried on by such State Government. In other words, the levy must be held to be
invalid and inapplicable only to the extent of those lands and buildings which are not
used or occupied for the purposes of any trade or business carried on by the State
Government, as explained hereinbefore.
[Paras 177 and 179(b)]
It is for the appropriate assessing authorities to determine after notice to the
affected State Government which land/building falls within which category in
accordance with law and in the light of this judgment and take appropriate further
action. In this connection, the assessing authorities under the applicable Act have to
decide several questions under it including the questions whether any land or
building is being used for "charitable purpose" or "public worship". They also have to
decide whether a land is an "agricultural land". These are difficult questions as would
be evident from a reference to the plethora of decisions under the Income Tax Act
where these expressions occur. For this reason, neither the exemption can be held
to be ineffective nor the authorities can be said to have no jurisdiction to decide
these questions. Appeals are provided to civil courts against the orders of the
assessing authorities.
[Paras 177 and 179(c)]
It is therefore directed that this judgment shall operate only prospectively. It will
govern the Financial Year 1996-97 (commencing on 1-4-1996) and onwards. For
this purpose, we invoke our power under Article 142 of the Constitution. The
reasons are the following:
(a) according to the judgment under appeal, the properties of the State were
exempt in toto whereas according to the present judgment, some of the
properties of the State situated within the Union Territory of Delhi may become
liable to tax. The assessees are the State Governments and the taxes are being
levied under a parliamentary enactment. This inter-State character of the dispute
is a relevant factor;
(b) from the year 1975 up to now, there have been no assessments
because of the judgment of the High Court; and
(c) retrospective assessment of properties under the above enactments
appears to be a doubtful proposition - at any rate, not an advisable thing to do
in all the facts and circumstances of this case.
Per Ahmadi, C.J., Verma, Agrawal and Hansaria, JJ.*
(1) Unlike other Federations, the Union of India has a sizeable territory of its
own comprising the Union Territories which have been specified in the First Schedule
to the Constitution. Therefore, the limited reciprocal inter-governmental immunity
bestowed by the Constitution in Articles 285 and 289 is given fuller meaning by
virtue of the adoption of the wider meaning of "Union taxation"; this would mean
that, just as the properties of the Union are exempt from taxes on property leviable
by the States, the properties of the States will also be exempt from taxes on
property leviable by the Union in areas falling within its territorial jurisdiction.
(Para 90)
Despite the fact that, of late, Union Territories have been granted greater
powers, they continue to be very much under the control and supervision of the
Union Government for their governance. Under the scheme of the Indian
Constitution, the position of the Union Territories cannot be equated with that of
the States. Though they do have a separate identity within the constitutional
framework, this will not enable them to avail of the privileges available to the
States. The definition of "State" provided in Section 3(58) of the General Clauses
Act, which declares that the word "State" would include "Union Territory", is
inapplicable to Article 246(4). The definition in Section 3(58) of the General Clauses
Act is repugnant to the subject and context of Article 246.

The phrase "Union taxation" appears in only two places in the entire Constitution
in the marginal heading of Article 289 and in the main text of Article 289(1). The
definition of "taxation" provided in Article 366(28) will not apply for the purpose of
interpreting Article 289(1). The term 'Union taxation' can and should be given the
widest amplitude, allowing it to encompass all taxes that are levied by the authority
of parliamentary laws. As clause (4) of Article 246 itself envisages situations where
Parliament is to make laws in respect of matters in the State List, it cannot be said
that this is a rare or an unusual circumstance. The Constitution does not contain
any provision which would indicate that the definition of "Union taxation" should be
restrictively interpreted so as to be within the confines of Article 246(1). The
specific situations envisaged in Articles 249, 250, 252, 253 and the Emergency
Provisions in Part XVIII of the Constitution do not make for the creation of any
anomalous situations. These articles, which provide for unusual exercises of
parliamentary power involving the matters enumerated in the State List, can be
regarded as exceptions to the general rule. Therefore, unless the context requires
otherwise - as in the case of Articles 249, 250, 252, 253 and the Emergency
Provisions in Part XVIII of the Constitution - the broad definition of "Union
taxation" embracing all taxes leviable by Parliament ought to be accepted for the
purpose of interpreting Article 289(1). The levy of taxes under Article 246(4) is
covered by the phrase "Union taxation" in Article 289(1).

referred to
Under the framework of the Constitution there are two principal bodies which
have been vested with plenary powers to make laws, these being the Union
Legislature, which is described by Article 79 as "Parliament for the Union" and the
State Legislatures, which are described by Article 168 in the singular as "Legislature
of a State". While certain other bodies have been vested with legislative power,
including the power of levying taxes, by the Constitution for specific purposes, as in
the case of District Committees and Regional Councils constituted under the aegis
of the Sixth Schedule to the Constitution, the plenary power to legislate, especially
in matters relating to revenue, still vests with the Union and the State Legislatures.
Even if the submission that Municipalities now possess, under Part IX-A of the
Constitution, a higher juridical status is correct, the extension of that logic to the
proposition that they have plenary powers to levy taxes is not, as is clear from a
perusal of the relevant part of Article 243-X of the Constitution. Thus even under
the new scheme, Municipalities do not have an independent power to levy taxes.
Although they can now be granted more substantial powers than ever before, they
continue to be dependent upon their parent legislatures for the bestowal of such
privileges. In the case of Municipalities within States, they have to be specifically
delegated the power to tax by the State Legislature concerned. In Union Territories
which do not have Legislative Assemblies of their own, such a power would have to
be delegated by Parliament. Of the rest, those which have Legislative Assemblies of
their own would have to specifically empower Municipalities within them with the
power to levy taxes.
(Paras 97 and 99)
Despite the fact that certain Union Territories have Legislative Assemblies of their
own, they are very much under the supervision of the Union Government and
cannot be said to have an independent status. Under our constitutional scheme, all
taxation must fall within either of two categories : State taxation or Union taxation.
Since it is axiomatic that taxes levied by authorities within a State would amount to
State taxation, it would appear that the words "or by any authority within a State"
have been added in Article 285(1) by way of abundant caution. It could also be that
these words owe their presence in the provision to historical reasons; Section 154
of the Government of India Act, 1935 was similarly worded. The fact that Article
289(1), which in its phraseology is different from Section 155 of the 1935 Act
having been drafted by the Drafting Committee to meet specific objections, does
not contain words similar to those in Article 285(1), will not in any way further the
case of the appellant, because the phrase "Union taxation" will encompass
municipal taxes levied by Municipalities in Union Territories.
(Para 100)
(2) As regards the judgment of Jeevan Reddy, J. where clause (2) of Article 289
has been invoked to validate the levy of taxes under the Punjab Municipal Act and
the Delhi Municipal Corporation Act upon those properties of State Governments
which are being occupied for commercial or trade purposes, we must express our
great reluctance to deal with this proposition, for it is not based on any contention
advanced by any of the counsel who appeared before the Court, either in their
written pleadings or in their oral submissions. This is not because we feel
constrained to restrict ourselves to the parameters prescribed by the submissions
of counsel, but because we feel that the opposite side did not have a fair
opportunity to answer the line of reasoning adopted in that behalf. The view taken
by Jeevan
The surest way legal research!
Reddy, J. has the effect of imposing considerable tax liabilities upon the properties
of the State Governments and, therefore, it would only be proper that their views in
this behalf be obtained before visiting them with such liability. The rule of caution
warns that ordinarily, courts should, particularly in constitutional matters, refrain
from expressing opinions on points not raised or not fully and effectively argued by
counsel on either side. Comparing Articles 285 and 289 it becomes evident that the
Constitution does envisage some form of inter-governmental immunity. Article 285
(1), while exempting the property of the Union from all taxes, does not attempt to
provide an exemption in respect of income as the States do not possess legislative
competence to levy taxes on income as such; however, taxes relating to income
that have a bearing on property such as the taxes on agricultural income levied by
using Entry 46 of the State List will also be exempt in view of the wide-ranging, all-
embracing nature of the exemption. Article 285(2) saves, until Parliament by law
decides otherwise, all pre-constitutional taxes applicable to Union property.
(Paras 101, 102 and 81)
As regards Article 289 its three clauses are interlinked, in that, clause (3) is an
exception to clause (2) which in turn is an exception to clause (1). The Framers of
the Constitution had consciously conferred Parliament with the option of deciding
which of the trading and business activities of the States would be subject to the
levy of Union taxes. So, while Article 289(1) generally exempts the property and
income of the States from Union taxation, clauses (2) and (3) grant to Parliament
the aforementioned prerogatives.
(Para 82)
Clause (2) of Article 289 was a well-considered compromise which was arrived
at after balancing the demands of those who sought complete exemption of
commercial activities of State Governments from Union taxation and those who
were in favour of levying such Union taxes. The Framers desired that the issue
whether the trading and business activities of State Governments should be subject
to Union taxation, be left to the wisdom of Parliament. Under the present scheme,
the power to tax is not automatic and the responsibility of specifying the trading
and business activities of State Governments which would be liable to Union
taxation is expressly vested in Parliament.
(Para 116)
New York V. United States, 90 L Ed 326 : 326 US 572 (1946); South Australia V.
Commonwealth, (1942) 65 CLR 373, referred to
Neither the Punjab Municipal Act, which is a 1911 enactment, nor the Delhi
Municipal Corporation Act, can qualify as laws under Article 289. They do not specify
which of the trading activities of State Governments are liable to taxation; indeed,
by their very nature, they cannot purport to do so. The Punjab Municipal Act and
the Delhi Municipal Corporation Act are not parliamentary laws in the sense
envisaged by Article 289(2). Though the Punjab Municipal Act is sought to be
construed as a post-constitutional, parliamentary enactment, the fact remains that
it is a pre-constitutional, colonial legislation. As for the Delhi Municipal Corporation
Act, it is, in essence, an ordinary municipal legislation. What makes it special is the
fact, occasioned in its case by geographical and historical factors, that it was
enacted by Parliament instead of by a State Legislature. It would be quite
dangerous to assume that when Parliament enacted the Delhi Municipal Corporation
Act, it had intended that the enactment should secure the purpose enshrined in
Article 289(2). If any safe assumption is to be drawn, it is this : in all probability,
while enacting the Delhi Municipal Corporation Act, Parliament must have
"transplanted" a municipal legislation existing in a certain State, made the necessary
changes and completed the procedural formalities. That would explain why the Delhi
Municipal Corporation Act (as also the New Delhi Municipal Council Act) contains an
exemption on the
lines of the one prescribed by Article 285 - this is a typical feature of ordinary
municipal legislations, which are enacted by State Legislatures who are conscious of
the mandate of Article 285. Moreover, such legislations do not contain exemptions
in favour of properties of State Governments because, within the territory of a
State, the properties of other State Governments are liable to taxation. So, when
such a legislation is "transplanted" almost verbatim into a Union Territory, it will
obviously not contain an exemption in favour of properties of State Governments.
In the face of the actual conditions which govern the enactment of laws for Union
Territories by Parliament, (these conditions have been statutorily provided;
moreover the Supreme Court has already taken notice of them) it is difficult to
assume that the omission of an exemption in the Delhi Municipal Corporation Act in
favour of State Governments, is deliberate. The Punjab Municipal Act and the Delhi
Municipal Corporation Act cannot, therefore, be said to meet the special
requirements which have been expressed by the Framers to be necessary for
complying with the spirit of Article 289(2).
(Paras 117 and 118)
cited
Jeevan Reddy, J. has taken the view that the doctrine of presumption of
constitutionality of legislations requires the saving of the taxes which these Acts
impose upon the commercial activities of State Governments. The Punjab Municipal
Act is a pre-constitutional enactment. The basis of this doctrine is the assumed
intention of the legislators not to transgress constitutional boundaries. It is difficult
to appreciate how that intention can be assumed when, at the time that the law
was passed, there was no such barrier and the limitation was brought in by a
Constitution long after the enactment of the law. The Framers obviously wanted
the law under Article 289(2) to be of a very high standard.
(Para 119)
Gulabbhai Vallabbhai Desai V. Union of India, AIR 1967 SC 1110 : (1967) 1 SCR
602, referred to
The doctrine of presumption of constitutionality of legislations is not one of
infinite application; it has recognised limitations. It is settled law that if any
interpretation is possible which will save an Act from the attack of
unconstitutionality, that interpretation should always be accepted in preference to
an alternative interpretation that might also be possible, under which the statute
would be void. However, the Supreme Court has consistently followed a policy of
not putting an unnatural and forced meaning on the words that have been used by
the legislature in the search for an interpretation which would save the statutory
provisions. Court is not "free to stretch or pervert the language of the enactment in
the interests of any legal or constitutional theory".

Diamond Sugar Mills Ltd. V. State of U.P., (1961) 3 SCR 242 : AIR 1961 SC 652,
relied on
The Punjab Municipal Act and the Delhi Municipal Corporation Act are ordinary
municipal legislations. They do not, and cannot, purport to be laws made by
Parliament under Article 289(2). There is no reason why such a strained reasoning
should be employed to save some of the taxes that may be capable of being
imposed on certain properties of State Governments. There seems to be no
pressing reason for invoking the doctrine. Jeevan Reddy, J. has, in the earlier part of
his opinion, held that a large number of properties of State Governments would be
exempt from taxes leviable under these Acts due to the operation of Article 39(1).
To employ such reasoning to construe Article 289(2) in a bid to save what would
only be a reduced amount, does not seem justified.
(Para 121)
Therefore, as regards the question whether Parliament has, in exercise of
powers under Article 289(2), imposed taxes on the trading and business activities
of State Governments, the view that since neither of these enactments are
purported to have been made under Article 289(2), they should not be treated as
having been enacted for that purpose and, consequently, should be held to be
incapable of levying taxes on any property, whether occupied for governmental or
trading purposes, of the State Governments is preferable. The second view
preferred by Jeevan Reddy, J. is fraught with several difficulties. Such a
construction, while being violative of the scheme envisaged by the Framers of the
Constitution, may well result in a situation that was sought to be avoided by them.
The directions given by Jeevan Reddy, J. may also lead to grave practical difficulties;
moreover, since the effect of the directions would be to vest the executive
authorities with substantial policy-making powers, their issuance might well be
offensive to established principles of delegation of powers.
(Paras 106 and 107)
The practical effect of the directions recommended by Jeevan Reddy, J. is also
worth noticing. The task of determining which of the activities of Governments are
governmental and which are commercial, is an extremely difficult one. Jeevan
Reddy, J. entrusts this assignment to the "assessing authorities under the Acts"
who can only be municipal authorities. This is an issue which has confounded courts
in the U.S. and in Australia for several years. This issue was considered to be so
troublesome by the Framers that they entrusted it to Parliament in the hope that it
would fully deliberate the matter before enacting a comprehensive legislation.
(Para 122)
The legislature can delegate some of its legislative functions provided it lays
down the policy in clear terms. The legislature is required to declare the policy of law
in unambiguous terms, lay down elaborate legal principles and provide illuminating
standards for the guidance of the delegate. Even though the Supreme Court has,
on occasions, sanctioned very broad delegations of taxing power to municipal
bodies, to delegate the task of carving out the distinction between governmental
and business functions of State Governments to municipal authorities would clearly
be against the interdiction in the Delhi Laws Act case as the assignment requires not
only the making of policy, but indeed, the making of very difficult and challenging
policy choices. There is no provision in the Delhi Municipal Corporation Act which
states that the trading and business operations of State Governments would be
subject to property taxes. The Punjab Municipal Act is equally silent on this aspect.
Consequently, no guidelines in this behalf are to be found within the parameters of
these legislations. Under these circumstances, in the complete absence of any
statutory policy or any guidelines for the delegation of such a policy. It would be
impermissible and hazardous to directly assign such a function, nay power, to
executive municipal authorities.
(Para 123)
referred to
The decision whether the properties of State Governments occupied for
commercial purposes should be subject to the levy of Union taxes is one that is
required by Article 289(2) to be made by a legislation which specifies the activities
which would be liable to tax. This decision cannot be entrusted to municipal
functionaries. For these reasons, we find ourselves unable to agree with Jeevan
Reddy, J. in his finding that the properties of State Governments occupied by them
for trade or business purposes are subject to the levy of taxes under the Punjab
Municipal Act and the Delhi Municipal Corporation Act.

The Judgments of the Court were delivered by
AHMADI, C.J. (on behalf of himself, Verma, Agrawal and Hansaria,
JJ.) - These civil appeals and special leave petitions have been filed
against the judgment and order of the Delhi High Court dated 14-3-
1975 in Civil Writ Petition No. 342 of 1969 and other orders which
follow this judgment. The appellant in all these matters is the New
Delhi Municipal Committee (sic Council) (hereinafter called "the
NDMC"). The respondents are the Union of India and the States of
Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat, Haryana, Jammu and Kashmir, Kerala,
Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Orissa, Punjab, Rajasthan, Tripura and
West Bengal. The Municipal Corporation of Delhi (hereinafter called "the
MCD") appears as an intervenor.
The Case History
2. The developments that occasioned the setting up of the
Constitution Bench may now be briefly set out. The Punjab Municipal
Act, 1911 (hereinafter called "the Act") is applicable to the Union
Territory of Delhi and under the provisions of this Act, the NDMC had
been levying property tax on the immovable properties of the
respondent States situated within Delhi. The respondents challenged
the imposition of such a tax on their properties before the Delhi High
Court by contending that it would fall within the exemption provided for
in Article 289(1) of the Constitution. In the impugned judgment, the
Delhi High Court, while accepting this contention, relied upon the
relevant observations of the nine-Judge Constitution Bench of this
Court in Sea Customs Act, 1878, S. 20(2), Re1 (hereinafter called "the
Sea Customs case"), to quash the assessment and demands of house
tax in respect of the properties of the States and restrained the NDMC
from levying such a tax in future. The NDMC filed an application under
Article 133(1)(c) of the Constitution seeking the grant of a
certificate for leave to appeal to the Supreme Court; while granting the
certificate, the High Court observed that the principal question before it
had grave constitutional implications which required an authoritative
decision by this Court.
3. On 1-1-1976, a Division Bench of this Court directed that the
NDMC could continue to make assessments but it was not to issue
demand notices or make any attempts towards realisation of the taxes.
On 29-10-1987, another Division Bench of this Court directed that the
matter be listed before a Constitution Bench. On 14-1-1993, a five-
Judge Constitution Bench of this Court began hearing arguments and
after considering the rival submissions, on 4-10-1994, passed an order
referring the matter to a nine-Judge Bench. In the said order, the
Bench observed that it had considered the decision in the Sea Customs
case¹ and was of the opinion that the point at issue in these matters
was covered therein. The decision in the Sea Customs case 1 having
been reaffirmed by the decision of this Court in A.P. SRTC V. ITO2
(hereinafter called "the AP SRTC case"), the Bench considered itself
bound by the decision; however, it was of the view that the arguments
advanced before it, which were not considered by the earlier decisions,
were plausible and required consideration which necessitated the
setting up of a nine-Judge Bench to hear the matter.
The Impugned Judgment
4. An analysis of the impugned judgment may now be resorted to in
order to gain an insight into the various constitutional questions that
will require our consideration. Before the High Court, the various States
contended the following : By virtue of Article 289(1) of the
Constitution, the property of the States is exempt from Union taxation;
the undefined phrase "Union taxation" in Article 289(1) would mean all
taxes which the Union is empowered to impose; under the
constitutional scheme and, specifically under Part VIII of the
Constitution, Union Territories are to be administered by the President
of India through the laws of Parliament; Parliament is the law-making
body for all Union Territories and by virtue of Article 246(4), while
legislating for Union Territories, the power of Parliament to make laws
extends to all the three lists in Schedule VII of the Constitution
pertaining to legislative competence; insofar as the Act and its
application to the Union Territory of Delhi is concerned, though it
relates to a matter in the State List, it would still amount to "Union
taxation" because, by virtue of its application to the Union Territory of
Delhi, it would be deemed to have been incorporated in law made by
Parliament and would therefore be a Union law imposing tax; since the
tax imposed by the Act amounts to Union taxation, the exemption in
Article 289(1) of the Constitution which makes the property of the
States immune from Union taxation would be attracted, and the
properties of the States situated in Delhi would be exempt from all
taxes on property.
5. For the NDMC, it was contended : the phrase "Union taxation"
would not extend to legislations in Union Territories and its
interpretation should be restricted to laws made by Parliament in
respect of the entries in List I; the Union had no power to impose taxes
on entries relating to property as they fall under List II; the Act being a
State legislation could not be treated as a Central Legislation for the
purpose of attracting Article 289(1); the test to determine whether a
tax forms part of "Union taxation" is to check if the proceeds thereof
form part of the Consolidated Fund of India; since the proceeds of taxes
on property under the Act did not form part of the Consolidated Fund of
India but were retained by the Municipality for its own purposes, such a
tax would not form part of "Union taxation" and the States were
therefore not entitled to be exempted from paying it under Article 289
(1); the scheme of the Constitution indicates that Part C States, which
later came to be called Union Territories, were carved out as separate
entities and were not to be regarded as part and parcel of the Union
Government; when the Union Government legislates for Union
Territories, it does so in a special and different capacity, and not as the
Union Legislature; it would therefore be erroneous to treat such laws
made by the Union Government for the Union Territories as part of
Union laws that would account for "Union taxation" under Article 289
(1).
6. To reach its conclusion, the High Court conducted an examination
of the legislative history of the Act and its extension to the Union
Territory of Delhi; studied the scheme of the Constitution with regard to
the distribution of legislative powers between the States and the Union;
considered the historical constitutional position of Union Territories;
scrutinised the series of decisions of this Court on the issue whether a
Union Territory is to be regarded as a State, and analysed the decision
in the Sea Customs case1 to appreciate the true import of Article 289
(1). In arriving at its conclusion, the High Court rejected the test of the
proceeds of taxes being part of the Consolidated Fund of India as being
determinative of the nature of Union taxation. It accepted the
contention that all laws applicable in a Union Territory would be
deemed to be laws made by Parliament and would therefore be part of
"Union taxation" and relied upon the following observation in the Sea
Customs case¹ for support : (SCR p. 812)
"If a State has any property in any Union Territory that property
would be exempt from Union Taxation on property under Article 289
(1).
The High Court rejected the contention that the Act was a State
enactment and stated that under the scheme of the Constitution, the
term "Union Territory" was distinct from "State" and therefore, the
Union Territories could not claim to be States for the purpose of
attracting the exemption in Article 289(1).
7. Faced with such a vast gamut of issues of constitutional import,
we are of the view that before we analyse the submissions put forth
before us by
the learned counsel for the various parties, it would be convenient if the
historical background of certain aspects of the matter could be set out
so as to provide a setting where the rival contentions can be better
understood.
Constitutional history of the areas that are now called "Union
Territories"
8. In the pre-constitutional era, these territories were called Chief
Commissioner's Provinces. The Government of India Act of 1919
contained specific provisions for the governance of these areas. Under
the scheme of the Government of India Act, 1935 (hereinafter referred
to as "the 1935 Act"), the Federation of India comprised : (a) the
Provinces called Governor's Provinces; (b) the Indian States which had
acceded to or were expected to accede to the Federation; and (c) the
Chief Commissioner's Provinces. Part IV of the 1935 Act dealt with the
Chief Commissioner's Provinces and Section 94 listed them as : (i)
British Baluchistan, (ii) Delhi, (iii) Ajmer-Marwara, (iv) Coorg, (v)
Andaman and Nicobar Islands, and (vi) the area known as Panth
Piploda : and provided that these areas were to be administered by the
Governor General, acting through a Chief Commissioner.
9. On 31-7-1947, during the incipient stages of the framing of the
Constitution, a Committee under the Chairmanship of Dr B. Pattabhi
Sitaramayya was established to study and report on the constitutional
changes required in the administrative structure existing in the Chief
Commissioner's provinces to give to the people of these provinces a
due place in the democratic governance of free India. After the
recommendations of this Committee were sanctioned by the Drafting
Committee, they were placed before the Constituent Assembly for its
consideration.
10. The Constituent Assembly considered all aspects of the issue
with a view to providing an appropriate administration for what were
called Part C States, which included three former Chief Commissioner's
Provinces - Delhi, Ajmer and Coorg - and some erstwhile Indian
States which were retained as Centrally-administered areas after their
merger with India; the latter group consisted of the following areas :
Himachal Pradesh, Bhopal, Bilaspur, Cooch-Behar, Kutch, Tripura,
Manipur and Vindhya Pradesh. It was decided that the decision whether
these territories should have legislatures and Councils of Ministers
ought to be left to Parliament and, for this purpose, an enabling
provision should be incorporated within the Constitution. It was also
provided that these Part C States would be administered by the
President, acting to such extent as he thought fit, through a Chief
Commissioner or a Lieutenant Governor to be appointed by him, or
through the Governor of a neighbouring State, subject to certain
procedural requirements. Accordingly, Articles 239 and 240 were
inserted in the final draft of the Constitution.
11. Under the Constitution of India, as initially enacted, the States
were divided into Part A States, Part B States, Part C States and the
territories in Part D. The First Schedule to the Constitution provided
details of the States falling within each of these categories. The Part C
States comprised : (i)
Ajmer; (ii) Bhopal; (iii) Bilaspur; (iv) Cooch-Behar; (v) Coorg; (vi)
Delhi; (vii) Himachal Pradesh; (viii) Manipur; and (ix) Tripura. The only
territory under Part D was Andaman and Nicobar. Part VIII of the
Constitution, comprising Articles 239-242, dealt with Part C States.
Article 239 provided that Part C States were to be administered by the
President acting through a Chief Commissioner or a Lieutenant
Governor. Article 240 provided that Parliament could, by law, create a
local legislature or a Council of Ministers or both for a Part C State and
such a law would not be construed as a law amending the Constitution.
Article 241 allowed Parliament to constitute High Courts for the States
in Part C States. Article 242 was a special provision for Coorg. Article
243, which also constituted Part IX of the Constitution, stated that
territories in Part D would be administered by the President through a
Chief Commissioner or other authority to be appointed by him.
12. In exercise of its powers under Article 240 (as it then stood),
Parliament enacted the Government of Part C States Act, 1951
whereunder provisions were made in certain Part C States for a Council
of Ministers to aid and advise the Chief Commissioner and also for a
legislature comprising elected representatives. Section 22 of this
legislation made it clear that the legislative powers of such Part C
States would be without prejudice to the plenary powers of Parliament
to legislate upon any subject.
13. The States Reorganisation Commission which was set up in
December 1953, while studying the working of the units of the Union,
took up the functioning of the Part C States for examination as an
independent topic. In its Report, submitted in 1955, the Commission
expressed the view that Part C States were neither financially viable nor
functionally efficient, and recommended that each of them should
either be amalgamated with the neighbouring States or made a
Centrally-administered territory.
14. Substantial changes were made by the Constitution (Seventh
Amendment) Act, 1956 (hereinafter called "the Seventh Amendment
Act"), which incorporated the recommendations of the States
Reorganisation Commission and was to have effect in concert with the
States Reorganisation Act, 1956. The four categories of States that
existed prior to these Acts were reduced to two categories. The first of
these categories comprised one class, called "States", and there were
14 such "States". The second category comprised the areas which had
earlier been included in Part C and Part D States; these areas were
called "Union Territories" and were six in number. Some additions and
deletions were made to the existing lists. While Ajmer, Bhopal, Coorg,
Bilaspur and Cooch-Behar became parts of other States, the Laccadive,
Minicoy and Amindivi Islands became a Union Territory. The six Union
Territories, therefore, were : (1) Delhi; (2) Himachal Pradesh; (3)
Manipur; (4) Tripura; (5) Andaman and Nicobar Islands; (6) the
Laccadive, Minicoy and Amindivi Islands.
15. The Seventh Amendment Act also replaced Articles 239 and 240
by new provisions; the new Article 240 allowed the President to make
regulations for certain Union Territories and this provision continues to
this day. It also repealed Articles 242 and 243 of the Constitution.
16. Subsequently, Dadra and Nagar Haveli became a Union Territory
by the Constitution (Tenth Amendment) Act, 1961; Goa, Daman and
Diu and Pondicherry became Union Territories by the Constitution
(Twelfth Amendment) Act, 1962; Chandigarh became a Union Territory
by the Punjab (Reorganisation) Act, 1966.
17. The Constitution (Fourteenth Amendment) Act, 1962 replaced
the old Article 240 as Article 239-A, enabling Parliament to create a
legislature and/or a Council of Ministers for Himachal Pradesh, Manipur,
Tripura, Goa, Daman and Diu and Pondicherry. Thereafter, by the
Government of Union Territories Act, 1963, Parliament did create
Legislative Assemblies, comprising three nominated persons, for these
territories.
18. Himachal Pradesh ceased to be a Union Territory by virtue of the
State of Himachal Pradesh Act, 1970. Manipur and Tripura became
States by virtue of the North-Eastern Areas (Reorganisation) Act, 1971.
Arunachal Pradesh, Mizoram and Goa, Daman and Diu ceased to be
Union Territories by virtue of the State of Arunachal Act, 1986, the
State of Mizoram Act, 1986 and the Goa, Daman and Diu
(Reorganisation) Act, 1987 respectively. The Laccadive, Minicoy and
Amindivi Islands (Alteration of Names) Act, 1973 changed the name of
these Islands to "Lakshadweep" but it continued to remain a Union
Territory.
19. The present list of Union Territories is as follows : (i) Delhi; (ii)
Andaman and Nicobar; (iii) Lakshadweep; (iv) Dadra and Nagar Haveli;
(v) Daman and Diu; (vi) Pondicherry; and (vii) Chandigarh. However, it
is to be noted that all the Union Territories do not have the same
status. By the Constitution (Sixty-Ninth Amendment) Act, 1991,
Articles 239-AA and 239-AB, which are special provisions in relation to
Delhi, were added. They provide that Delhi, which is to be called the
National Capital Territory of Delhi, is to have a Legislative Assembly
which will be competent to enact laws for matters falling in Lists II and
III barring a few specific entries. As the position stands at the present
moment, the Union Territories can be divided into three categories:
(i) Union Territories without legislatures - comprising Andaman
and Nicobar, Lakshadweep, Dadra and Nagar Haveli, Daman and Diu
and Chandigarh.
(ii) Union Territories for which legislatures have been established
by Acts of Parliament under Article 239-A - Pondicherry is the sole
occupant of this category.
(iii) Union Territories which have legislatures created by the
Constitution (Articles 239-AA and 239-AB) - The National Capital
Territory of Delhi is the sole occupant of this category.
The Constitutional History of the National Capital Territory of Delhi and
the application of the Act to it
20. The area that is now known as the National Capital Territory of
Delhi was, until 1911, classified as a District of the State of Punjab.
Following the announcement of the decision to transfer the capital of
British India from Calcutta to Delhi, Government Notification No. 911
dated 17-9-1912 was issued authorising the Governor General to take
under his authority the territory comprising the Tehsil of Delhi and
adjoining areas. The notification provided for the administration of
these areas as a separate province under the Chief Commissioner. The
Delhi Laws Act, 1912 and the Delhi Laws Act, 1915 made provisions for
the continuance of laws in force in the territories comprising the Chief
Commissioner's Province in Delhi and for the extension of other
enactments in force in any part of British India to Delhi by the Governor
General-in-Council. Under the Government of India Act, 1919, the
Indian Legislature had the power to enact laws for the province of
Delhi. However, legislation for Delhi was made by extension of laws in
force in Punjab and other States by notifications issued under the Delhi
Laws Acts, 1912 and 1915. This enabled the Governor General-in-
Council to ensure, as far as possible, uniformity of laws with Punjab,
since a substantial part of Delhi had originally formed an administrative
district of that province. After Independence, Delhi continued to be
administered directly by the Government of India and the different
Departments of that Government began to deal directly with
corresponding Departments in the Chief Commissioner's Office. This
arrangement continued till shortly after the commencement of the
Constitution.
21. In the period immediately after the commencement of the
Constitution, the Part C States Act, 1951 contained a specific provision,
Section 21, in respect of Delhi which enabled it to have a Legislative
Assembly and a Council of Ministers with restrictive powers to make
laws. As a result of this provision, Delhi continued to have a Legislative
Assembly and a Council of Ministers till 1956.
22. The States Reorganisation Commission devoted special attention
to the needs of the National Capital. It noted that the dual control
arising from the division of responsibility between the Union
Government and the State Government of Delhi had not only hampered
the development of the capital, but had also resulted in a "marked
deterioration of administrative standards in Delhi". The Commission
came to the conclusion that the National Capital must remain under the
effective control of the Union Government. With reference to the plea
for a popular Government, it observed:
"We are definitely of the view that municipal autonomy in the
form of the Corporation which will provide greater local autonomy
than is the case in some of the important federal capitals, is the
right, in fact, the only solution of the problem of Delhi State."
23. After the Seventh Amendment Act came into force, following the
recommendations of the States Reorganisation Commission, the
Legislative Assembly and the Council of Ministers for Delhi ceased to
exist with effect
from 1-11-1956. Furthermore, the Delhi Municipal Act, 1957 was
enacted constituting a Municipal Corporation for the whole of Delhi with
members elected on the basis of adult franchise. The jurisdiction of the
MCD covered almost the entire Union Territory of Delhi, including both
urban and rural areas. The areas within the limits of NDMC and Delhi
Cantonment Board were kept outside the jurisdiction of the MCD, but
the territorial jurisdiction of the NDMC was reduced. As already
mentioned, the Constitution (Sixty-Ninth Amendment) Act, 1991
introduced Articles 239-AA and 239-AB into the Constitution which
provided for a Legislative Assembly and a Council of Ministers for Delhi.
Subsequently, the Government of National Capital Territory of Delhi
Act, 1991 was enacted to supplement these constitutional provisions.
24. The Act, which was enacted in 1911, was directly applicable to
Delhi since at that point of time, it was a district of the State of Punjab.
In 1912, when Delhi became a Chief Commissioner's Province, the
provisions of the Act and various other Punjab enactments were made
to continue in force in the territory of Delhi by virtue of the Delhi Laws
Act of 1912 and the Delhi Laws Act of 1915. After the Constitution
came into being, the Act was made to continue by virtue of the
provisions of the Part C States Laws Act of 1950 and the Union
Territories Laws Act of 1950.
25. Therefore, at the time when the present dispute arose, the Act
was still in force. However, in 1994, the Legislative Assembly of the
National Capital Territory of Delhi++ enacted the New Delhi Municipal
Committee (sic Council) Act, 1994 which is the law in force today. The
MCD levied property tax on properties situated within the local limits of
its jurisdiction by virtue of the provisions of the Delhi Municipal
Corporation Act, 1957. However, for the purposes of deciding the case,
we are concerned only with the provisions of the Act.
26. Before this Court, a number of parties have advanced arguments
on the various issues involved in the case. Mr B. Sen, counsel for the
appellants, NDMC, as also the intervenor, MCD, began by challenging
the essential premises of the impugned judgment and advanced
elaborate arguments on the manner in which the various constitutional
provisions that are germane to the case, ought to be interpreted. The
learned Attorney General for India, appearing for the Union of India,
supported the stance adopted by the NDMC. These submissions were
strenuously opposed by Mr P.P. Rao, learned counsel for the State of
Punjab and in this endeavour, he was assisted by Mr A.K. Ganguli,
learned counsel for the State of Tripura who buttressed the position of
the States with his own submissions. The learned counsel appearing for
the State of Rajasthan lent support to the same.
The Central Issues
27. As before the High Court, so before us, the controversy between
the parties has, in the main, centred around the question whether the
properties owned and occupied by the various States within the
National Capital Territory of Delhi are entitled to be exempted from the
levy of taxes under the Act by virtue of the provisions of Article 289(1).
The larger question involved, which will consequently require our
consideration, is whether by virtue of Article 289(1), the States are
entitled to exemption from the levy of taxes imposed by laws made by
Parliament under Article 246(4) upon their properties situated within
Union Territories.
28. At this stage, we may set out the provisions that are central to
the adjudication of the present matter. In the following table, for the
purposes of clarity and convenience, Articles 285 and 289 of the
present Constitution have been contrasted against their immediate
predecessors, viz., Sections 154 and 155 of the 1935 Act.

Submissions of Counsel
29. Mr Sen prefaced his submissions for the NDMC and the MCD by
pointing out that the phrase "Union taxation" used in Article 289(1) of
the Constitution has not been defined either in the text of the
Constitution or in any of the decisions rendered by this Court. Pointing
out the differences between Articles 285 and 289, Mr Sen stated that
(i) the former exempts "all taxes" whereas the latter limits its
exemption to taxes relating to "property and income"; and (ii) the
former uses the words "imposed by a State or by any authority within a
State" whereas the latter uses the phrase "Union taxation". Thereafter,
Mr Sen contrasted Article 289(1) and Section 155 of the 1935 Act by
pointing out that while Section 155(1) uses the words "lands and
buildings", Article 289(1) uses the word "property". This, he explained,
was on account of the strong position adopted by representatives of the
States in the Constituent Assembly who had insisted that the ambit of
the exemptions be cast wider.
30. At this juncture, we may refer to Article 246 which reads as
follows:
"246. Subject-matter of laws made by Parliament and by the
Legislatures of States.-(1) Notwithstanding anything in clauses (2)
and (3), Parliament has exclusive power to make laws with respect
to any of the matters enumerated in List I in the Seventh Schedule
(in this Constitution referred to as the 'Union List').
(2) Notwithstanding anything in clause (3), Parliament, and,
subject to clause (1), the Legislature of any State also, have power
to make laws with respect to any of the matters enumerated in List
III in the Seventh Schedule (in this Constitution referred to as the
'Concurrent List').
(3) Subject to clauses (1) and (2), the Legislature of any State
has exclusive power to make laws for such State or any part thereof
with respect to any of the matters enumerated in List II in the
Seventh Schedule (in this Constitution referred to as the 'State
List').
(4) Parliament has power to make laws with respect to any matter
for any part of the territory of India not included in a State
notwithstanding that such matter is a matter enumerated in the
State List."
31. Mr Sen then submitted that two possible meanings could be
ascribed to the phrase "Union taxation" : (i) Taxes that are levied by
Parliament in exercise of its powers under Article 246(1) and pertain
only to entries in List I of the Seventh Schedule; (ii) any tax that is
levied as a result of a law passed by Parliament including those that are
relatable to entries in List II and List III of the Seventh Schedule. Mr
Sen vehemently urged that the former interpretation be adopted by
this Court. According to him, acceptance of the latter would lead to
anomalous results. He submitted that when Parliament makes laws in
exercise of its powers under Article 246(4) and in doing so, legislates
on entries in List II, it is doing so in a different capacity and the
character of these laws is different from ordinary Union legislations. To
drive home the argument, Mr Sen led us through certain other
provisions of the Constitution, such as, Articles 249, 250, 252 and the
Emergency Provisions in Part XVIII of the Constitution which empower
Parliament to make laws on entries in List II, but the nature and effect
of these legislations requires that they be not treated as ordinary Union
legislations.
32. Thereafter, he took us through various provisions in Part XII of
the Constitution with a view to analysing the distribution of revenues
between the Union and the States. Having done so, he invited our
attention to the provisions of Part VIII of the Constitution to support his
stand that a Union Territory is an independent constitutional entity akin
to a State and that it has an identity separate from that of the Union
Government. To this end, he drew our attention towards several
decisions of this Court on the question whether a Union Territory is a
State and sought to convince us that, in the present context, the
answer to this query must be in the affirmative.
33. Referring to the two decisions of this Court on the interpretation
of Article 289(1) rendered in the Sea Customs case¹ and the AP SRTC
case², Mr Sen contended that the issue arising before this Court in the
present matter had not arisen for adjudication in either of these two
cases. He submitted that the observation made by Sinha, C.J. in the
former case would, therefore, have to be regarded as obiter dicta since
the issue of laws relating to Union Territories was not before the Court.
He explained that such an observation was made in the context of
situations where Parliament can directly impose a tax on property to
counter the argument that only States could levy taxes directly on
property under the Constitution. Mr Sen stated that the observation
was founded on misconceived premises and that there were other,
more appropriate situations where Parliament could impose taxes
directly on property, such as, in the case of Entry 3, List I which deals
with
cantonments and the Cantonments Act, 1924 which allows Parliament
to levy taxes for cantonments. Mr Sen then contended that such a
power would be available to Parliament even when it enacts a
legislation by using Entry 49, List I which relates to patents, inventions
and designs, and also in the case of a few other entries in List I.
34. Thereafter, Mr Sen contended that, in any event, the taxes levied
by NDMC would not amount to Union taxation because they are in the
nature of a municipal tax. Our attention was drawn towards the
Constitution (Seventy-Fourth) Amendment Act, 1992 which
incorporated Part IX-A, dealing with municipalities in our Constitution.
He argued that municipalities now have an elevated constitutional
status and that since they have their own machinery for collecting taxes
besides having control over the fixing and charging of the taxes, these
taxes cannot be regarded as part of "Union taxation". He then took us
through the relevant provisions of the Actthe New Delhi Municipal
Council Act, 1994 and the Delhi Municipal Corporation Act, 1957 to
indicate that each of these bodies has been vested with wide powers of
fixing the rates of taxes, collecting them and then using the proceeds,
which go to specially created municipal funds, towards securing their
objectives. Drawing sustenance from the language of Article 285, which
specifically exempts taxes imposed by local authorities, Mr Sen
submitted that since such an express exemption is not referred to in
Article 289(1), municipal taxes were not meant to be covered within its
exemption and, therefore, the States are bound to pay these taxes to
the NDMC and the MCD.
35. The learned Attorney General for India began by stating that it is
not the identification of the legislature that imposes the law which is
determinative of the issue of "Union taxation". According to him, to
determine the true character of Union taxation, the subject of the levy
must be analysed. He submitted that when Parliament makes use of its
power under Article 246(4), it does so in an unusual circumstance
where the "theme" of the legislation undergoes a change. He, therefore,
stressed that in determining the scope of "Union taxation", attention
must be paid to the 'theme", (i.e. the context and the specific
circumstances in which the tax is levied) rather than to the
"author" (i.e. the body which is levying the tax). He, therefore,
submitted that the interpretation of "Union taxation" should be
restricted to situations where Parliament makes laws imposing taxes
under Article 246(1).
36. His next submission was that Articles 285 and 289 do not
exhaust the entire area of taxation under the Constitution. Referring to
certain other provisions where Parliament is required to make laws for
subjects in List II, the learned Attorney General drew our attention
towards Articles 249, 250, 252, 253 and 357. He then submitted that
these provisions envisage unusual situations where, although
Parliament is the law-making body, the resulting laws are not Union
laws in the ordinary sense and the taxes imposed by these laws cannot
be said to form part of "Union taxation". He then contended that
similarly, laws made by Parliament under Article 246(4) are not the
norm
and cannot be said to form part of "Union taxation". Thereafter, the
learned Attorney General took us through the constitutional history of
Union Territories and more specifically, that of the National Capital
Territory of Delhi. Having done so, he stated that such an analysis
would reveal that though Union Territories are not States, they are akin
to States, being nascent States. He explained that the practice in this
regard shows that, in most cases, when a territory is acquired by the
Union and before it is admitted to the Indian Union as a full-fledged
State, it is groomed for Statehood by being nurtured as a Union
Territory. He then referred us to the decision of this Court in Ramesh
Parliament cannot be expected to draft legislations for Union Territories
on a regular basis and to explain how it meets with its obligations in
this regard.
37. Mr P.P. Rao, learned counsel for the States of Punjab and
Haryana, began his submissions by explaining the doctrine of immunity
of instrumentalities, which is said to be the legal basis for the
incorporation of Articles 285 and 289 into our Constitution, and also
mentioned the comparative positions in the American, Canadian and
Australian jurisdictions. He submitted that the doctrine postulates that
in a federal set-up, there should be inter-governmental tax immunities
between the federal and State wings. Such an immunity is a
constitutional limitation on the law-making power of the respective
legislatures in the field of taxation as a whole. After its genesis in the
U.S., the doctrine has come to be accepted in Canada and Australia. Mr
Rao conceded that though both the 1935 Act as well as the Constitution
had incorporated such reciprocal tax immunities, they were not adopted
to the same extent as in Canada and Australia. However, unlike in
these countries, the Union of India has a sizeable territory of its own
comprising all the Union Territories specified in the First Schedule. The
power to make laws including laws authorising levy or collection of
taxes of all kinds is conferred exclusively on the Union Parliament and
these territories would form an important part of the reciprocal tax
immunities.
38. He then drew our attention to Article 265 which incorporates an
important constitutional limitation on the power of taxation when it
states that "no tax shall be levied or collected except by authority of
law". In India, there are only two legislatures that are competent to
tax: "Parliament for the Union" and the "Legislature of a State".
Therefore, all taxation must fall within either of the categories - Union
taxation or State taxation. Municipalities and other local authorities
cannot have an independent power to tax and that is why there can be
no exemption for municipal taxes independent of the exemption for
State or Union taxation. To that extent, he submits, the contention of
Mr Sen, that Article 289 exempts only Union taxation without
mentioning municipal taxes which would imply that the States would
not be exempt from paying the latter, cannot be accepted.
39. Moving on to the definition of the term "Union taxation", Mr Rao
pointed out that in Article 285 the term "State taxation" has been
defined as "all taxes imposed by a State or by any authority within a
State". He urged us to adopt a similar interpretation for "Union
taxation" even though Article 289 does not contain any such definition
by pointing out that being corollaries of each other, these terms would
have been used to convey a similar meaning. If this definition were to
be accepted, "Union taxation" would mean "all taxes imposed by the
Union" and, therefore, the State would be entitled for exemption from
the taxes imposed by NDMC. To explain the language and ambit of
Articles 285 and 289, Mr Rao took us through a detailed examination of
the provisions of the 1935 Act with a view to appreciating the true
import of the predecessors of these two provisions, namely, Sections
154 and 155 of the said Act. To this end, we were taken through
Sections 5, 6, 94, 99, 100, 104, 154 and 155 and Lists I and II of the
Seventh Schedule to the 1935 Act. Mr Rao, thereafter, contended that
under the scheme of the 1935 Act, it was quite clear that by virtue of
Section 155, the Provinces (predecessors of "States") were entitled to
exemption from taxes on "lands and buildings" in the Chief
Commissioner's Provinces (predecessors of "Union Territories"). He
contends that that position continues in the present Article 289 and, in
fact, the immunity is much wider in scope since "property" is wider
than "lands and buildings". Mr Rao also led us through the relevant
passages of the Sea Customs case1 and stressed that both the minority
and the majority opinions in that case had taken the view that the
properties of States situated in Union Territories were exempt from
taxation. To sum up, Mr Rao put forth his submissions to counter those
put forth by Mr Sen and the learned Attorney General towards
establishing that, even while exercising its powers under Article 246(1),
Parliament can levy taxes directly on property.
40. Mr A.K. Ganguli, learned counsel for the State of Tripura, lent
support to the submissions of Mr Rao on the issue of parliamentary laws
being applicable to Union Territories; he emphasised that even after the
introduction of Articles 239-AA and 239-AB in the Constitution, the
Delhi Legislature could not be said to be a legislative body with plenary
powers. The legislative powers conferred on such a body are restricted
and limited to certain spheres and are subject to the powers of
Parliament to make laws with respect to any matter for the Union
Territories, which obviously refers to Article 246(4) of the Constitution.
By way of an analogy, he referred us to Article 244 and the Sixth
Schedule to the Constitution which contain provisions for the
administration of tribal areas in the States of Assam, Meghalaya,
Tripura and Mizoram and provide for bodies with legislative powers. He
led us through decisions of this Court on the point that the law-making
powers of these bodies, though conferred by the Constitution itself, are
not plenary powers as those of Parliament or of the State Legislatures.
41. The counsel submitted that the provisions contained in Part XII
of the Constitution relating to distribution of revenue between the
Union and the States are not determinative of the scope of the
expression "Union taxation" in Article 289(1) as they only indicate that
though a large number of taxes are levied by Parliament and collected
by the Union Government, eventually, a substantial portion thereof is
distributed amongst the States.
42. After submitting that the main controversy in this case is
squarely covered by the decision in the Sea Customs case1 Mr Ganguli
pointed out that the Government of India, while preparing its Receipt
Budget, has always treated taxes imposed by Parliament and collected
from the Union Territories as part of the total tax revenue of the Union
Government in which other taxes such as corporation tax, taxes on
income, customs duties and Union excise duties are also included. He
submitted that even in respect of non-tax revenue, the receipts from
the Union Territories are treated as receipts of the Union Government.
He, therefore, contended that even the Union Government was of the
view that "Union taxation" included taxes levied by Parliament in Union
Territories.
43. The learned counsel for the State of Rajasthan, Mr Gupta, sought
to bring to our notice a wider comparative position of the manner in
which countries around the world have adopted the American doctrine
of reciprocal immunity.
44. Having noticed the submissions of the counsel for the various
parties before us, we may now proceed to express our opinion on the
diverse points raised in the present case.
Analysis of the decisions rendered in the Sea Customs case1 and the AP
SRTC case
45. The decision in the Sea Customs case1 was occasioned by the
emanation of a proposal to introduce in Parliament a Bill to amend
Section 20 of the Sea Customs Act, 1878, and Section 3 of the Central
Excises and Salt Act, 1944. These amendments would have led to the
imposition of indirect taxes, namely, excise and customs duties upon
the properties of various States which were being used for purposes
other than those specified in Article 289(2), i.e., for purposes not
relating to trade or business. A number of State Governments objected
that such a law would fall foul of the interdiction in Article 289(1) and,
in view of the resulting controversy, the President referred, under
Article 143, the issue of the constitutionality of the proposed
amendments to this Court. The issue was decided by a majority of 5 :
4. It was held that the immunity granted to States in respect of Union
taxation under Article 289 extends only to those taxes that are directly
leviable upon the property and income of the States; since excise and
customs duties are indirect taxes, they would not fall within the ambit
of the exemption in Article 289 and Parliament could impose such
duties upon the property and income of the States. There were two
opinions outlining the
majority view and an equal number for the minority. Sinha, C.J.
delivered the first of the majority judgments on behalf of himself,
Gajendragadkar, Wanchoo and Shah, JJ. while Rajagopala Ayyangar, J.
delivered a separate. concurring opinion. S.K. Das. J. delivered the first
of the minority opinions on behalf of himself, Sarkar and Das Gupta, JJ.
while Hidayatullah, J. rendered a separate minority opinion. A number
of submissions were advanced before the Court with a view to
facilitating a true construction of Article 289(1). In this regard,
comparisons were drawn with its corollary, Article 285 and with the
provisions which inspired the adoption of these two provisions, namely,
Sections 154 and 155 of the 1935 Act. The Court was also required to
analyse the scheme of the Constitution relevant to the issue. For the
moment, it is not necessary for us to analyse those aspects of the
decision since, in any event, we will be required to give our
independent consideration to these matters. We can, therefore, confine
ourselves to those observations that have a direct bearing upon the
point at issue with which we are presently concerned; this aspect was,
however, not specifically adverted to in all the four opinions.
46. In his opinion for the majority, Sinha, C.J. has referred to the
essential contentions urged before the Court. The Union urged that the
exemption in clause (1) of Article 289 be interpreted restrictively,
limiting its applicability to direct taxes on the property and the income
of States; the States, on the other hand, canvassed for an expansive
interpretation which would exempt them from taxes having any relation
whatsoever to their property and income. The learned Chief Justice
noted that it was not disputed that the exemption in Article 289(1)
was, as far as taxes on income are concerned, restricted to "Taxes other
than on agricultural income", which is the only entry (Entry 82) in List I
of the Seventh Schedule which enables Parliament to legislate on taxes
relating to income. The learned Chief Justice considered this to be a
significant fact as it meant that if the income of State was exempt only
from taxes on income, the juxtaposition of the words "property and
income" in Article 289(1) would lead to the inference that property is
also exempt only from direct taxes on property. However, it was
pointed out by the States that List I does not contain any specific tax
on property which would enable Parliament to pass a law relating to
taxes on property and, that being so, the intention of the Framers of
the Constitution must have been to exempt the property of States from
all taxes, be they direct or indirect. To meet this argument, the learned
Solicitor General, appearing for the Union, put forth several arguments,
one of which came to be accepted by the learned Chief Justice as the
main plank upon which he based his rejection of the contention of the
States. Since these observations are directly relevant to the present
case, they may be extracted here : (SCR p. 812)
"It is true that List I contains no tax directly on property like List
II, but it does not follow from that that the Union has no power to
impose a tax directly on property under any circumstances. Article
246(4) gives power to Parliament to make laws with respect to any
matter for any part
of the territory of India not included in a State notwithstanding that
such matter is a matter enumerated in the State List. This means that
so far as Union Territories are concerned Parliament has power to
legislate not only with respect to items in List I but also with respect to
items in List II. Therefore, so far as Union Territories are concerned,
Parliament has power to impose a tax directly on property as such. It
cannot therefore be said that the exemption of States' property from
Union taxation directly on property under Article 289(1) would be
meaningless as Parliament has no power to impose any tax directly on
property. If a State has any property in any Union Territory that
property would be exempt from Union taxation on property under
Article 289(1). The argument therefore that Article 289(1) cannot be
confined to tax directly on property because there is no such tax
provided in List I cannot be accepted."
(emphasis added)
Thereafter, having referred to the language of Article 285 and the
intention of the Framers as perceived by him, the learned Chief Justice
came to the conclusion that the immunity granted by Articles 285 and
289 was of similar ambit and extended only to direct taxes without
exempting indirect taxes such as excise and customs duties.
47. Das, J., in his dissenting opinion, noted the objection of the
States that List I had no entry which would enable Parliament to levy a
tax directly on property. He took note of the counter-arguments
advanced by the learned Solicitor General in relation to this aspect but
could not bring himself to agree with the correctness of those
propositions. While referring to the argument on Article 246(4), he
noted : (SCR pp. 846-47)
"
It would be a case of much ado about nothing if the
Constitution solemnly provided for an exemption against 'property
tax' on State property only for such rare cases as are contemplated
in Article 246(4), the situation of State property in territory not
included in a State. Such situation would be very rare, and could
have hardly necessitated a solemn safeguard at the inception of the
Constitution when the States were classed under Part A or Part B of
the First Schedule. If the wider interpretation of clause (1) of Article
289 is accepted, such property would also be exempted from Union
taxation except in cases covered by clause (2) of the article. We find
it difficult to accept the contention that clause (1) of Article 289 was
meant only for cases covered by Article 246(4)
"
(emphasis added)
At this juncture, we may note that both Mr Rao and Mr Ganguli were at
pains to point out that though Das, J. rejected the overall contention of
the learned Solicitor General, he had, by stating that the exemption
could not have been provided "only for such rare cases as are
contemplated in Article 246(4)", implicitly accepted that these cases
would fall within the exemption in Article 289(1).
48. Rajagopala Ayyangar, J., in his separate majority judgment,
makes a specific reference to this contention of the learned Solicitor
General (at
pp. 918-19) but, aside from stating that "the submission of the learned
Solicitor General are not without force" (at p. 919), he did not make
any further reference to the matter. Hidayatullah, J., in his separate
minority opinion, did not advert to this issue.
49. The preceding analysis reveals that the issue at hand was
specifically answered by this Court in the Sea Customs case1. We find it
difficult to accept Mr Sen's contention that the observations of Sinha,
C.J. were made by way of obiter dicta. Though the issue of legislations
applicable in Union Territories was not specifically before the court, it
did arise for consideration during its analysis of the power of Parliament
to levy taxes directly upon property. The latter question was squarely
before the Court and the issue relating to Union Territories, though
incidental to the main question, necessarily required consideration. The
observations of Sinha, C.J. are unequivocally in favour of the position
adopted by the States before us, who find themselves in the enviably
advantageous position of being able to draw sustenance from even the
observations in the dissenting judgment of Das, J.
50. The decision in the Sea Customs case1 was reaffirmed by a
Constitution Bench of this Court in the AP SRTC case which was a
matter relating to assessment of income tax. The facts of that case are
not directly relevant for our purpose but, what is of considerable
interest to us is the manner in which the scheme of Article 289 and its
three clauses were construed. Speaking for the Court, Gajendragadkar,
C.J. outlined the scheme of Article 289 (at p. 25) which can be stated
as follows : The general proposition that flows from clause (1) is that
ordinarily, the income derived by a State both from governmental and
non-governmental or commercial activities shall be immune from
income tax levied by the Union. Clause (2) then provides an exception
and empowers Parliament to make a law imposing a tax on the income
derived by the Government of a State from trade or business carried on
by it, or on its behalf. If clause (1) had stood by itself, it would not
have been possible to include within its purview income derived by a
State from commercial activities but since clause (2) empowers
Parliament to enact a law levying taxes on such activities of a State, the
inescapable conclusion is that these activities must be deemed to have
been included in clause (1) and that alone can be the justification for
the words in which clause (2) has been couched in the Constitution.
Thereafter, clause (3) empowers Parliament to declare by law that any
trade or business would be taken out of the purview of clause (2) and
restore it to the area covered by clause (1) by declaring that the said
trade or business is incidental to the ordinary functions of Government.
In other words, clause (3) is an exception to the exception prescribed
by clause (2). Whatever trade or business is declared to be incidental to
the ordinary functions of Government, would cease to be governed by
clause (2) and would then be exempt from Union taxation.
51. These observations of Gajendragadkar, C.J. having been made in
the context of income tax levied in the facts of that case, mention only
taxes relating to income. They are equally applicable to the taxes
relating to property referred to in Article 289. The essence of this
analysis is that clause (3) of Article 289 is an exception to clause (2),
which in turn is an exception to the first clause of the article.
Analysis of this Court's previous rulings on the constitutional status of
Union Territories
52. We may now refer to a catena of decisions of this Court on the
seemingly innocuous issue whether or not a Union Territory has, under
the scheme of our Constitution, a status distinct from that of the Union
and the States. The fact that so many decisions of this Court exist on
the issue would indicate that the matter is not one that can be disposed
of by simply pointing to the separate parts of the Constitution which
deal with Union Territories as distinct units.
53. Before dealing with the specific circumstances of, and the
decision in, each of these cases, it is necessary that a few provisions
which figure prominently be dealt with. Article 246(4) of the
Constitution, as it stood on 26-1-1950, allowed Parliament to "make
laws with respect to any matter for any part of the territory of India not
included in Part A or Part B of the First Schedule". The Seventh
Amendment Act brought about a number of changes affecting Union
Territories, some of which have already been noticed by us. The other
changes brought about by it are also relevant; it caused Article 246 to
be changed to its present form where Parliament is empowered to make
laws with respect to "any part of the territory of India not included in a
State". The word "State" has not been defined in the Constitution.
Article 1(3) defines the territory of India as comprising : (a) the
territories of the States; (b) the Union Territories specified in the First
Schedule; and (c) such other territories as may be acquired. The word
"Union Territory" has been defined in Article 366(30) to mean "any
Union Territory specified in the First Schedule and includes any other
territory comprised within the territory of India but not specified in that
Schedule".
54. Though not defined in the Constitution, the word "State" has
been defined in the General Clauses Act, 1897 (hereinafter called "the
General Clauses Act"). Article 367 of the Constitution states that the
General Clauses Act, 1897 shall, unless the context otherwise requires
and subject to any adaptations and modifications made under Article
372, apply for the interpretation of the Constitution. Therefore, on a
plain reading of the provisions involved, it would appear that the
definition of "State" in the General Clauses Act would be applicable for
the purposes of interpreting the Constitution. Article 372 is the saving
clause of the Constitution which enables all laws in force before the
commencement of the Constitution to continue in the territory of India.
Article 372-A, which, once again, owes its origin to the Seventh
Amendment Act, empowers the President to make further adaptations
in particular situations.
55. Section 3(58) of the General Clauses Act, having been amended
by the Seventh Amendment Act, reads as follows:
"3. Definitions. In this Act, and in all General Acts and
Regulations made after the commencement of this Act, unless there
is anything repugnant in the subject or context,-
(58) 'State',-
(a) as respects any period before the commencement of the
Constitution (Seventh Amendment) Act, 1956, shall mean a
Part A State, a Part B State or a Part C State; and
(b) as respects any period after such commencement, shall
mean a State specified in the First Schedule to the Constitution
and shall include a Union Territory;"
(emphasis added)
The latter part of the definition, which states that a Union Territory is
included within the definition of a State, has introduced an element of
controversy in the interpretation of the Constitution.
56. While appreciating the reasoning of this Court in dealing with
cases where it had to confront the issue of the status of Union
Territories, the time-frame and the history of the Union Territories
which we have adverted to in the earlier part of this judgment, must be
borne in mind. The first of these cases was that of Satya Dev Bushahri
V. Padam Dev4. This was a case relating to election law and one of the
contentions of the appellant, who was seeking to disqualify the
respondents under the provisions of the Representation of People Act,
1951, was that contracts entered into by the respondents with the Part
C States were, in effect, contracts entered into with the Central
Government. This contention was based on the reasoning that the
executive action of the Central Government is vested in the President;
the President is also the Executive Head of Part C States; therefore,
contracts with Part C States are contracts with the Central Government.
The Court, speaking through Venkatarama Ayyar, J., rejected this
contention and stated that when the President exercised functions as
the Head of Part C States, he occupied a position analogous to the
Governor in Part A States. Furthermore, Section 38(22) of the
Government of Part C States Act, 1951 clearly provided that all
executive action of the State would be taken in the name of the Chief
Commissioner. It was, therefore, held that contracts with the Part C
States could not be said to be contracts with the Central Government.
Analysing Articles 239, 240 and 241 of the Constitution, the Court held
that it could not be said that these had the effect of converting Part C
States into the Central Government and that they have a distinct
status. However, when the case came up for review, in Satya Dev
Bushahri V. Padam Dev5, the Court, after having been directed towards,
and having taken note of the provisions of, Section 3(8) and Section 3
(60) of the General Clauses Act which define "Central Government" and
"State Government" respectively, and stipulate that for Part C States,
references to "State Government" would
mean the "Central Government", held that a contract with the Chief
Commissioner in a Part C State is a contract with the Central
Government. It, however, added that this would not affect the status of
Part C States as independent units, distinct from the Union Government
under the Constitution.
57. State of M.P. V. Shri Moula Bux6, a decision rendered by a
Constitution Bench, concerned the State of Vindhya Pradesh which, at
the relevant time, was a Part C State and raised the issue whether, in a
civil suit, the State of Vindhya Pradesh was the proper party to be sued
under Section 79(a) of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908. The argument
of the respondents, based on Sections 3(8) and 3(60) of the General
Clauses Act, was that if, in case of the Part C States, "State
Government" means the "Central Government", the proper party to be
sued would be the Union of India instead of the State of Vindhya
Pradesh. Hidayatullah, J., speaking for the Constitution Bench, at pp.
798-802, relied on the observations in the first of the Satya Dev4 cases
to the effect that Part C States had a separate existence and were not
merged with the Central Government and went on to hold that the
State of Vindhya Pradesh, having a distinct identity, was the proper
party to be sued. Although the reviewed decision in Satya Dev case5
was not referred to, since the proposition relied upon by Hidayatullah,
J. was in fact reaffirmed in the review, the relevant proposition of law
laid down in the case does not suffer from any infirmity.
58. These cases are useful for our purpose to the limited extent that
they declare that Union Territories are not part of the Central
Government and are, to that extent, distinct constitutional entities.
However, the issue whether Union Territories are distinct from States
was not considered in these cases; it did however arise for
consideration in the following cases. In Ram Kishore Sen V. Union of
India4 the Court had to consider whether the word "State" used in
Article 3(c) of the Constitution would include Union Territories; the
Constitution Bench followed the stipulation in Articles 367 and 372 to
notice the definition of "State" in Section 3(58) of the General Clauses
Act and the context of Article 3 to hold that the word 'State' in Article 3
(c) would have to be interpreted in the light of Section 3(58) of the
General Clauses Act and would include Union Territories. The
correctness of this proposition was doubted by Hidayatullah, J. in a
subsequent case which we will refer to in due course. The fact however
remains that the definition in Section 3(58) of the General Clauses Act
has been utilised for interpreting a constitutional provision. The
question that therefore arises is whether this will affect the status of
Union Territories in matters relating to Article 246, to which an answer
was provided in a subsequent case to which we shall immediately
advert.
59. T.M. Kanniyan V. ITO8 was a case in which the petitioners had
challenged the vires of a regulation by which the President had, in
exercise of powers under Article 240, repealed the laws in force in
relation to income tax within the Union Territory of Pondicherry and had
made the Income Tax Act, 1961 applicable to it. Explaining that
Parliament, and through it the President, had plenary powers to make
laws for Union Territories on all matters, Bachawat, J., speaking for the
Constitution Bench, stated as follows : (SCR pp. 108-09)
"Parliament has plenary power to legislate for the Union Territories
with regard to any subject. With regard to Union Territories there is
no distribution of legislative power. [The] inclusive definition [in
Section 3(58) of the General Clauses Act] is repugnant to the
subject and context of Article 246. There, the expression 'State'
means the States specified in the First Schedule. There is a
distribution of legislative power between Parliament and the
legislatures of the States. Exclusive power to legislate with respect
to the matters enumerated in the State List is assigned to the
legislatures of the States established by Part VI. There is no
distribution of legislative power with respect to Union Territories.
That is why Parliament is given power by Article 246(4) to legislate
even with respect to matters enumerated in the State List. If the
inclusive definition of 'State' in Section (58) of the General Clauses
Act were to apply to Article 246(4), Parliament would have no power
to legislate for the Union Territories with respect to matters
enumerated in the State List and until a legislature empowered to
legislate on those matters is created under Article 239-A for the
Union Territories, there would be no legislature competent to
legislate on those matters; moreover, for certain territories such as
the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, no legislature can be created
under Article 239-A, and for such territories there can be no
authority competent to legislate with respect to matters enumerated
in the State List. Such a construction is repugnant to the subject and
context of Article 246. It follows that in view of Article 246(4),
Parliament has plenary powers to make laws for Union Territories on
all matters."
60. The Court, therefore, held that Parliament was empowered to
make laws for Union Territories on all matters and the regulation made
by the President in exercise of his powers under Article 240 was valid.
The ratio of this decision, therefore, is that the definition of "State"
provided by Section 3(58) of the General Clauses Act would not apply
for the purposes of Article 246. This ratio is equally applicable at the
present moment for, despite several changes having been made in
respect of Union Territories since the decision in Kanniyan case8 of the
seven existing Union Territories, as many as five do not have
legislatures of their own. The controversy was not, however, put to rest
by the decision in Kanniyan case8
61. In Advance Insurance Co. Ltd. V. Gurudasmal ², the main issue
before another Constitution Bench was whether the word "State" used
in Entry 80 of List I of the Seventh Schedule could be said to exclude
the application of the definition in Section 3(58) of the General Clauses
Act. Relying on the decision in Kanniyan case Hidayatullah, J. held
that, ordinarily, the definition would apply in the interpretation of the
Constitution unless it is repugnant to the subject or context. However,
he noted, that after the Seventh Amendment Act where Union
Territories have been mentioned as separate entities, the distinction
between "Union Territories" and "States" cannot be lost sight of. He
expressly approved the reasoning of Bachawat, J. in holding that in the
context of Article 246, the definition provided in Section 3(58) would
not apply; however, on the facts and in the circumstances of the case
before him, he felt that the subject and context of Entry 80 of the Union
List required the application of the definition given in Section 3(58).
While referring to the decision in Ram Kishore case ¹, Hidayatullah, J.
noted that this decision was per incuriam for the reason that it referred
to Article 372 whereas the proper reference ought to have been to
Article 372-A.
62. The same issue was thereafter considered by a Constitution
Bench in Shiv Kirpal Singh V. V.V. Giri10, wherein Bhargava, J., while
delivering an opinion concurring with the majority, reached the
conclusion that the definition in Section 3(58) of the General Clauses
Act would not apply to matters involving interpretation of the
Constitution. The case, which involved a challenge to the election of
Shri V.V. Giri as the President of India, required the Court to consider
the issue in the context of Article 54 which provides that the electoral
college for the President consists of the elected members of both
Houses of Parliament, and the elected members of the Legislative
Assemblies of the States. Relying on the definition of "State" in Section
3(58) of the General Clauses Act, it was argued that Union Territories
are also States and, consequently, the elected members of the
Legislative Assemblies of the Union Territories must also be included in
the electoral college; their omission was said to be a material
irregularity which would vitiate the election. Responding to this
p. 659, para 241)
"Article 54, no doubt, lays down that all elected members of the
Legislative Assemblies of the States are to be included in the
electoral college; but the word 'States' used in this article cannot
include Union Territories. It is true that, under Article 367, the
General Clauses Act applies for interpretation of the Constitution as
it applies for the interpretation of an Act of the Legislature of the
Dominion of India; but that Act has been applied as it stood on 26th
January, 1950, when the Constitution came into force, subject only
to any adaptations and
modifications that may be made therein under Article 372. The General
Clauses Act, as it was in 1950 and as adapted or modified under Article
372, did not define "State" so as to include a Union Territory. The
Constitution was amended by the Constitution (Seventh Amendment)
Act, 1956, which introduced Article 372-A in the Constitution
permitting adaptations and modifications of all laws which may be
necessary or expedient for the purpose of bringing the provisions of the
law into accord with the Constitution as amended by the Seventh
Amendment Act, 1956. It was in exercise of this power under Article
372-A that Section 3(58) of the General Clauses Act was amended, so
that, thereafter, 'State' as defined included Union Territories also. The
new definition of 'State' in Section 3(58) of the General Clauses Act as
a result of modifications and adaptations under Article 372-A would, no
doubt, apply to the interpretation of all laws of Parliament, but it cannot
apply to the interpretation of the Constitution, because Article 367 was
not amended and it was not laid down that the General Clauses Act, as
adapted or modified under any article other than Article 372, will also
apply to the interpretation of the Constitution. Since, until its
amendment in 1956, Section 3(58) of the General Clauses Act did not
define 'State' as including Union Territories for purposes of
interpretation of Article 54, the Union Territories cannot be treated as
included in the word 'State'."
This view of the learned Judge does seem to have considerable
force and it is also to be remembered that Hidayatullah, J. had doubted
the correctness of the proposition laid down in Ram Kishore case on
the ground that the proper reference in it should have been to Article
372-A, rather than to Article 372. However, we must refrain from
making any comment because the issue whether or not the General
Clauses Act applies to the interpretation of the Constitution is not
properly before us in the facts and circumstances of the present case;
what is more, no arguments have been canvassed before us on this
issue. For the present, we can draw support from the observations in
Kanniyan case8 as affirmed in the Advance Insurance case9 to the effect
that the definition in Section 3(58) of the General Clauses Act is
repugnant to the subject and context of Article 246. We can, therefore,
proceed on the assumption that for our purposes, a Union Territory is
not a State; we must, however, hasten to add that this assumption will
be open to reconsideration subsequent to our analysis of the
constitutional scheme regarding the issues before us.
Interpretation of "Union taxation" in Article 289(1) and scope of its
ambit
64. We may now address the central issue in the case which involves
the determination of the ambit of Article 289(1). In order to appreciate
the true import of the words used in this provision, it will be to our
benefit to
examine the constitutional history of Article 289 as well as that of its
corollary, Article 285.
65. Articles 285 and 289 are modified versions of Sections 154 and
155 of the 1935 Act, as is obvious from a comparative study made in
the earlier part of this judgment. While Articles 285 and 289 seek to
provide reciprocal immunities within the Republic of India to the Union
and the States from each other's taxing powers, Sections 154 and 155
strove to achieve the same result within British India in respect of the
Federal Government on the one hand, and the Governments of the
Provinces and the Federated States on the other. However, in the
process of adopting the provisions of the 1935 Act for our Constitution,
a number of changes occurred and we must analyse some of these in
greater detail for they are extremely relevant for our purposes.
66. To appreciate the true import of Sections 154 and 155, it will be
necessary to refer to a few provisions of the 1935 Act so as to obtain an
understanding of its general scheme. Section 5 of the 1935 Act stated
that the Federation of India would comprise the Provinces, the Indian
States and the Chief Commissioner's Provinces. Section 6 defined a
"Federated State" as an Indian State which had acceded to or might
accede to the Federation. Section 94 provided a list of the Chief
Commissioner's Provinces and stated that they would be administered
by the Governor General acting through a Chief Commissioner. Section
99, which provided the manner in which legislative powers were to be
distributed between the Federal and Provincial Legislatures, stated that
the Federal Legislature was empowered to make laws for the whole or
any part of British India or for any Federated State, while the Provincial
Legislatures were empowered to make laws for the provinces. Section
311(1) defined "British India" as "All territories for the time being
comprised within the Governor's Provinces and the Chief
Commissioner's Provinces". Section 100, which dealt with the subject-
matter of Federal and Provincial laws, provided that the Federal
Legislature would have power to make laws with respect to matters
enumerated in List I of the Seventh Schedule to the 1935 Act, which
was to be called the "Federal Legislative List"; the Provincial Legislature
would have powers to make laws in respect of matters in List II of the
Seventh Schedule, called "the Provincial Legislative List"; and, in
respect of matters provided in List III of the Seventh Schedule, called
"the Concurrent Legislative List", both the Provincial and the Federal
Legislatures would have jurisdiction. Clause (4) of Section 100, which is
of considerable importance for our purpose, provided in express terms
that the Federal Legislature would have "power to make laws with
respect to matters enumerated in the Provincial Legislative List except
for a Province or any part thereof". It was, therefore, clearly
contemplated that the Federal Legislature would have the power to
make laws for matters in the Provincial Legislative List in respect of the
Chief Commissioner's Provinces and the Federated States. Under the
scheme of the 1935 Act, situations where the Federal Legislature could
enact laws with respect to matters in the Provincial Legislative List
were, therefore, not considered to be rare or unusual.
67. While both the Federal Legislative List and the Provincial
Legislative List contained entries allowing the levy of taxes, the Federal
Legislative List did not contain any entry which allowed the Federal
Legislature to levy taxes directly on property. Entry 42 of the Provincial
Legislative List empowered the Provincial Legislatures to levy taxes
specifically on lands and buildings. The Concurrent Legislative List
contained only one entry relating to taxes, namely, Entry 13 which
referred to stamp duties.
68. Section 154, in material terms, provided that the property of the
Federal Government would be exempt from all taxes imposed by
Provinces and Federated States and the local authorities within them.
The proviso added that, in the absence of any Federal law stipulating
otherwise, those properties of the Federal Government which were
subject to the levy of taxes before the commencement of Part III of
that Act would continue to be liable to pay them. The exemption in
Section 154, therefore, did not extend to such taxes, including taxes
levied under municipal laws. It is to be noted that Section 154 did not
provide for an exemption in respect of the income of the Federal
Government primarily because the Provinces lacked the legislative
competence to enact laws levying taxes on income.
69. Section 155(1) stated that the Government of a Province and the
ruler of a Federated State would not be liable to "Federal taxation" in
respect of "lands or buildings situated in British India". Proviso (a)
stipulated that all the trading and business activities carried on by
Provinces and the Federated States outside their territorial jurisdiction
would be subjected to Federal taxation in British India. Proviso (b)
stipulated that the personal property and income of a Ruler of a
Federated State would also be subject to Federal taxation. Clause (2) of
the section being self-explanatory, does not require elucidation. In
response to a query from us, Mr Sen sought to find the reason for the
existence of the exemption in Section 155(1); it appears that the
purpose was to avoid the liabilities imposed by Sections 3 and 9 of the
Income Tax Act, 1912 upon the Provinces.
70. Comparing the text of Sections 154 and 155, it becomes clear
that even under the scheme of the 1935 Act, the ambit of the reciprocal
immunities was not equal in length and breadth; while Section 154
exempted the property of the Federal Government from "all taxes", the
Provincial Governments and Rulers of Federated States were entitled to
an exemption only in respect of "lands or buildings" situated in British
India and "income" accruing thereof. This feature will gain some
importance when we deal with the comparative constitutional position
at a later stage.
71. The term "Federal taxation" was not defined in the 1935 Act but
some clue to its meaning can be discerned by referring to Sections 99
and 100 which described the legislative powers of the Federal
Legislature. As we have already seen, the Federal Legislative List did
not allow the Federal Legislature to levy taxes on lands and buildings;
in fact this subject was expressly included in the Provincial Legislative
List. On the face of it, this
would make the exemption in Section 155 otiose. However, the
confusion clears when one notices clause (4) of Section 100 which
expressly enables the Federal Legislature to legislate in respect of
matters in the Provincial Legislative List for territories apart from the
Provinces. Viewed in this context, and taking into account the definition
of "British India" in Section 311(1), Section 155 would have to be read
as exempting the Governments of Provinces and the Rulers of
Federated States from "Federal taxation" in respect of lands or
buildings situated in the Chief Commissioner's Provinces. This is the
only possible interpretation which will give meaning to the words of
Section 155. Since, at the time of the enactment of the legislation,
there were only six territories classified as Chief Commissioner's
Provinces, the exemption could not be said to be on a par with the
exemption provided in Section 154 but, all the same, in terms of the
revenue amount involved, it could not be considered insignificant
either. It therefore becomes clear that, under the scheme of the 1935
Act, "Federal taxation" included taxes leviable by the Federal
Government in the Chief Commissioner's Provinces and that the
properties of the Provinces and the Rulers of the Federated States
situated within these Chief Commissioner's Provinces would be exempt
from such "Federal taxation". It remains to be seen whether the
position came to be changed during the process of transformation of
these sections into the existing provisions of the Constitution.
72. In the earlier stages of the framing of the Constitution, the issue
of financial relations between the Centre and the units was addressed
by two Committees - the Union Powers Committee and the Union
Constitution Committee. These Committees recommended that the
schemes envisaged by the 1935 Act should be generally followed. In
the Draft Constitution prepared by the Constitutional Adviser, Sir B.N.
Rau, in October 1947, clauses 205 and 207 were modified versions of
Sections 154 and 155. On 2-10-1947, an Expert Committee on
Financial Provisions was appointed to make recommendations as to the
provisions on the subject to be embodied in the new Constitution after
taking into account the views of the States and also the Draft prepared
by the Constitutional Adviser. The Drafting Committee of the
Constitution took up the issue in January 1948 and took into
consideration the Drafts prepared by the Constitutional Adviser as also
the views of the Expert Committee on Financial Provision. Thereafter,
these provisions came to be numbered as Articles 264 and 266 of the
Draft Constitution. After the Constituent Assembly had considered the
matter at length and formally approved these provisions, they came to
be renumbered as Articles 285 and 289.
73. The present Article 285 is much the same as its predecessor
Section 154 and, though there were some changes in its text as the
provision charted its course through the stages enumerated above, not
being relevant for our purposes, we shall ignore its discussion.
74. The present Article 289 was clause 207 in the Draft Constitution
prepared by the Constitutional Adviser. It provided that the
Government of a
unit would not be liable to Federal taxation in respect of lands or
buildings situated within the territories of the Federation or income
accruing, arising or received within such territories; the two exceptions
provided were in favour of (a) any income accruing to a unit's
Government through trade or business, and (b) the personal property
or the personal income of the Ruler of Indian State. As we have
observed, under Section 155, the Provinces and Federated States were
liable to taxation only in respect of trade and business operations
carried on by them outside their own territories. To that extent clause
207 had made a substantial departure. The Constitutional Adviser relied
on the decisions of the Supreme Court of the United States of America
in McCulloch V. Maryland11 and South Carolina V. United States1 12 to
buttress his stance that the Federation should have the power to tax
the units, but not vice versa for the reason that when the Federation
taxed the instrumentalities of the units, it taxed its constituents,
whereas when a unit taxed the operations of the Federal Government, it
acted upon instrumentalities created, not by its own constituents, but
by people over whom it could claim no control.
75. The Expert Committee on Financial Provisions approved the
Constitutional Adviser's recommendation that the trading operations of
the units, as also of local bodies, whether carried on within or without
their jurisdiction should be liable to Central taxation; they, however,
suggested that quasi-trading operations incidental to the normal
functions of the Government should be exempt from such taxation.
76. When the Drafting Committee took up the matter, it duly noted
the recommendations of the Constitutional Adviser and the Expert
Committee and, in July 1949, convened a Premiers' Conference to
discuss these provisions. Draft Article 266 came in for a lot of criticism
and a number of States suggested that insofar as Article 266 did not
exempt the trading and business operations of State Governments from
Union taxation, it be dispensed with altogether. Other suggestions were
also forwarded to the Drafting Committee : a number of States were of
the view that the provision was inequitable and one-sided insofar as it
sought to subject trade and business operations of the State
Governments to Union taxation, while under Article 264, States were
debarred from taxing the property of the Union. Such a provision, it was
felt, was bound to retard the industrial development of the Provinces,
taking away the incentive for State enterprise.
77. Reconsidering the provision in the light of the comments of the
Provincial Governments, the Drafting Committee decided, in
consultation with the Central Ministry of Finance, to introduce some
important changes in Article 266. The ambit of the exemption in clause
(1) was expanded by including "property" instead of "lands or
buildings" thereby bringing within its purview, moveable property as
well. On the issue of trade and business, a provision similar to the
present Article 289(2) was included. This provision
would enable Parliament to pass a law to declare which of the trading
and business activities of the States were to be classified as ordinary
functions of the Government allowing them to be exempted, and
making the rest of the activities liable to tax. Draft Article 266 was
considered by the Constituent Assembly on 9-9-1949. Some members
representing the States of Travancore-Cochin and Mysore expressed
apprehensions that Union taxation of industrial and commercial
activities would check the expansion of industrialisation and would
reduce the capacity of States to discharge their ordinary governmental
functions. Mr P.T. Chacko from Travancore-Cochin referred to the
principle of immunity from inter-governmental taxation as it stood in
the United States of America and the fact of its incorporation in Draft
Article 264; he sought the extension of the doctrine to States as well.
While allaying their apprehensions, Mr Alladi Krishnaswami Ayyar noted
the fact that the Australian, Canadian and American Constitutions had
incorporated the principle of inter-governmental immunities. He stated
that the Australian and Canadian experiences were irrelevant for the
purposes of the Indian Constitution for, when they were drafted, it was
not envisaged that large schemes of socialisation would be
implemented. Referring to the American position, he pointed out that
even within that jurisdiction, the doctrine had begun to lose favour and
was in the process of being discarded. Thereafter, he observed that
under the provision as it was placed before the Constituent Assembly,
Parliament was left with the option of making the law which would
declare those trading and business operations of the States which
would be liable to Union taxation after taking into account the general
interests of trade and industry of the whole country and other
democratic factors. He therefore felt that the provision was "very
salutary". Subsequently, following the reassurances given by the
Central Finance Minister, the amendments were withdrawn and Draft
Article 266 was accepted in toto. [Note : For a study of the evolution of
Articles 285 and 289 within the Constituent Assembly, see B. Shiva
Rao, The Framing of the Indian Constitution : A Study, N.M. Tripathi
Pvt. Ltd., Bombay (1968) pp. 649-99; for reference to original
documents, see B. Shiva Rao, ibid, Vols. III & IV.]
78. Mr P.P. Rao and the other learned counsel appearing for the
States have argued before us that the present Articles 285 and 289 are
based on the U.S. doctrine of reciprocal immunity of instrumentalities
which has also been incorporated in the Canadian and Australian
Constitutions, apart from certain other Constitutions. Before we begin
to examine the text of Articles 285 and 289 with a view to finding a
solution to the constitutional conundrum posed by the case before us,
we must analyse this proposition closely.
79. The doctrine of inter-governmental immunity has been the
subject of some controversy in the country of its origin, the United
States of America. The origin of this doctrine is ascribed to the
judgment of Chief Justice John
Marshall in the case of McCulloch V. Maryland11. However, as pointed
out by commentators, on the facts of the case, where a State tax
sought to be levied on a Federal Bank was held to be void, the decision
was more in favour of declaring the supremacy of the Federal
Government than of upholding the rights of States. It was, therefore,
the basis for establishing Federal immunity from State taxation.
However, later decisions interpreted the judgment to hold that its
corollary, that the property of States would be exempt from Federal
taxation was equally applicable; more than 50 years after the decision
in McCulloch case¹¹, the Supreme Court, in Collector V. Day13 made the
theory of inter-governmental immunity reciprocal. The doctrine, as
propounded in Collector V. Day13, was never applied widely and, in
subsequent years, underwent significant modifications. In South
Carolina case¹2, , which was the second case relied upon by the
Constitutional Adviser in preparing clause 207 of his Draft Constitution,
the Supreme Court dealt a further blow to the concept of immunity of
States from Federal taxation, when it held that South Carolina was
bound to pay a National Excise Tax on liquor dealers which was being
levied by the Federal Government. The Supreme Court drew a
distinction between State functions which were strictly governmental
and those which were commercial in nature; it was held that the
governmental functions of State would be immune from taxation but
when the States entered into ordinary business, no immunity would
exist. This created fresh problems and over time, several Judges of the
Supreme Court protested against the illogical distinction between
governmental and business activities, calling for a complete re-
examination of the entire doctrine. In later years, the doctrine was
considerably modified. In recent years, the Supreme Court has come to
recognise a narrower tax immunity for the States than for the National
Government on the basis of a theory that combines the principle of
national supremacy with the argument that the interests of States
received more representation in Congress than national interest
received in State Legislature. It is to be noted that we have had this
position from the time that the Constitution was originally enacted.
80. As we have already noticed, the Constitutional Adviser relied
upon the decisions in McCulloch case11 and South Carolina case 12 , for
justifying the reduction in the ambit of the immunity of States from
Union taxation rather than for establishing reciprocal immunity between
the States and the Union. Furthermore, in the Constituent Assembly, Mr
Alladi Krishnaswami Ayyar had doubted the applicability of the doctrine
to the Indian Constitution and had instead commended the present
scheme whereby the troublesome issue of determining which of the
trading and business operations of the State should be subject to Union
taxation has been left to Parliament; while enacting such a law
Parliament would be forced to cater to the interests of the States on
account of the presence of their representatives
in it. The usefulness of any further discussion on the applicability of this
doctrine to the Indian Constitution is rendered questionable by virtue of
the fact that this Court had, on earlier occasions, rejected it. In State of
W.B. V. Union of India 14 Sinha, C.J., speaking for the majority in a six-
Judge Constitution Bench expressly held (at p. 407) that the doctrine of
immunity of instrumentalities had been rejected by the Privy Council as
inapplicable to the Canadian and Australian Constitutions and having
practically been given up in the United States, it was equally
inapplicable to the Indian Constitution. In the AP SRTC case 2 (SCR at
p. 24), the Court rejected the contention of the Advocate General of
Andhra Pradesh urging it to adopt the American doctrine, by relying
upon these observations of Sinha, C.J.
81. It is, therefore, clear that in seeking a solution to the problem
faced by us, we must rely primarily on the bare text of Articles 285 and
289. Comparing these provisions, it becomes evident that the
Constitution does envisage some form of inter-governmental immunity.
Article 285(1), while exempting the property of the Union from all
taxes, does not attempt to provide an exemption in respect of income
as the States do not possess legislative competence to levy taxes on
income as such; however, taxes relating to income that have a bearing
on property such as the taxes on agricultural income levied by using
Entry 46 of the State List will also be exempt in view of the wide-
ranging, all-embracing nature of the exemption. Article 285(2) saves,
until Parliament by law decides otherwise, all pre-constitutional taxes
applicable to Union property.
82. With respect to Article 289, we have already examined the
manner in which this provision was analysed by this Court in the AP
SRTC case². We are in agreement with the proposition that the three
clauses of Article 289 are interlinked, in that, clause (3) is an exception
to clause (2) which in turn is an exception to clause (1). As we have
noticed for ourselves, the Framers of the Constitution had consciously
conferred Parliament with the option of deciding which of the trading
and business activities of the States would be subject to the levy of
Union taxes. So, while Article 289(1) generally exempts the property
and income of the States from Union taxation, clauses (2) and (3) grant
to Parliament the aforementioned prerogatives.
83. Having understood the scheme of Articles 285 and 289, we must
sharply focus on the specific wording of Article 289(1) and, in
particular, on the meaning of the phrase "Union taxation". It may be
noted that the phrase "Union taxation" appears in only two places in
the entire Constitution - in the marginal heading of Article 289 and in
the main text of Article 289(1). It is suggested that some guidance
may be obtained by analysing the term "State taxation" which appears
in the marginal heading of Article 285 and has been described in the
text of Article 285(1) as "all taxes imposed by a State". On that
reasoning, "Union taxation" would mean "all taxes imposed by the
Union".
84. The word "taxation" has been defined in Article 366(28) which
states that unless the context otherwise requires, the word "taxation"
includes "the imposition of any tax or impost, whether general or local
or special and, "tax" shall be construed accordingly". This definition was
accepted by Das, J. and Hidayatullah, J. in their minority opinions (at
pp. 834-35 and 893-94 respectively) in the Sea Customs case1 for
interpreting Article 289(1). However, Sinha, C.J., in his majority
opinion (at pp. 923-34), rejected the application of this definition to
Article 289(1) as, in his opinion, the context of Article 289(1) precluded
the application of the definition. Rajagopala Ayyangar, J., in his
separate majority opinion (at pp. 921-93), also felt that the definition
would not apply. We concur with the majority view in the Sea Customs
case¹ that the definition of "taxation" provided in Article 366(28) will
not apply for the purpose of interpreting Article 289(1).
85. Our attention has been drawn towards the provisions contained
in Part XII of the Constitution which has a bearing on the scheme of the
Constitution with respect to financial relations between the Union and
the States. Since this aspect and its relevance to Article 289(1) was
discussed at length in the Sea Customs case1, we may advert to those
observations. Das, J. (at p. 852), was of the opinion that the provisions
of Part XII of the Constitution would have no bearing on the import of
Articles 285 and 289 which ought to be construed on their own terms.
Sinha, C.J., however, analysed these provisions at length and the
relevant observations in this behalf may be reproduced : (SCR pp. 809-
11)
"It will thus appear that Part XII of the Constitution has made
elaborate provisions as to the revenues of the Union and of the
States, and as to how the Union will share the proceeds of duties and
taxes imposed by it and collected either by the Union or by the
States. Sources of revenue which have been allocated to the Union
are not meant entirely for the purposes of the Union but have to be
distributed according to the principles laid down by parliamentary
legislation as contemplated by the articles aforesaid. Thus all the
taxes and duties levied by the Union and collected either by the
Union or by the States do not form part of the Consolidated Fund of
India but many of those taxes and duties are distributed amongst
the States and form part of the Consolidated Fund of the States.
Even those taxes and duties which constitute the Consolidated Fund
of India may be used for the purposes of supplementing the
revenues of the States in accordance with their needs.
The
financial arrangement and adjustment suggested in Part XII of the
Constitution has been designed by the Constitution-makers in such a
way as to ensure an equitable distribution of the revenues between
the Union and the States, even though those revenues may be
derived from taxes and duties imposed by the Union and collected by
it or through the agency of the States.
It will thus be seen that the
powers of taxation assigned to the Union are based mostly on
considerations of convenience of imposition and collection and not with
a view to allocate them solely to the Union; that is to say, it was not
intended that all taxes and duties imposed by the Union Parliament
should be expended on the activities of the Centre and not on the
activities of the States.
The resources of the Union Government are
not meant exclusively for the benefit of the Union activities; they are
also meant for subsidising the activities of the States in accordance
with their respective needs, irrespective of the amounts collected by or
through them. In other words, the Union and the States together form
one organic whole for the purposes of utilisation of the resources of the
territories of India as a whole."
86. We are of the view that an analysis of some of the provisions in
Part XI, Chapter I of the Constitution, which deals with the legislative
relations between the Union and the States will be crucial to the
determination of the central issue in this case. We may first notice
certain provisions in the Constitution which enable Parliament to make
laws for subjects contained in the State List, to which our attention was
drawn by counsel for the appellants as also the learned Attorney
General. We must note that these provisions conceive of extraordinary
situations. Article 249 provides for a situation where, if the Council of
States declare by a resolution that it is necessary in the national
interest to do so, Parliament may make laws in respect of matters
enumerated in the State List. Article 250 empowers Parliament to make
laws for the whole or any part of India in respect of matters
enumerated in the State List while a Proclamation of Emergency is in
operation. Article 252 empowers Parliament to make laws with respect
to matters enumerated in the State List if two or more States resolve
that such a course of action is desirable. Article 253 reserves to
Parliament the exclusive power to make laws for the whole or any part
of the territory of India for implementing any treaty, agreement or
convention with any other country or any decision made at any
international conference, association or any other body. The Emergency
Provisions outlined in Part XVIII of the Constitution and comprising
Articles 352 to 360 conceive of special situations in which Parliament is
empowered to enact laws on matters in List II.
87. It has been urged that when Parliament legislates for Union
Territories in exercise of powers under Article 246(4), it is a situation
similar to those enumerated above and is to be treated as an
exceptional situation, not forming part of the ordinary constitutional
scheme and hence falling outside the ambit of "Union taxation". Having
analysed the scheme of Part VIII of the Constitution including the
changes wrought into it, we are of the view that despite the fact that,
of late, Union Territories have been granted greater powers, they
continue to be very much under the control and supervision of the
Union Government for their governance. Some clue as to the reasons
for the recent amendments in Part VIII may be found in the
observations of this Court in Ramesh Birch case3 which we have
extracted earlier. It is possible that since Parliament may not have
enough time at its disposal to enact entire volumes of legislations for
certain Union Territories, it may decide, at least in respect of those
Union Territories whose importance is enhanced on account of the size
of their territories and their geographical location, that they should be
given more autonomy in legislative matters. However, these changes
will not have the effect of making such Union Territories as independent
as the States. This point is best illustrated by referring to the case of
the National Capital Territory of Delhi which is today a Union Territory
and enjoys the maximum autonomy on account of the fact that it has a
legislature created by the Constitution. However, clauses (3)(b) and (3)
(c) of Article 239-AA make it abundantly clear that the plenary power
to legislate upon matters affecting Delhi still vests with Parliament as it
retains the power to legislate upon any matter relating to Delhi and, in
the event of any repugnancy, it is the parliamentary law which will
prevail. It is, therefore, clear that Union Territories are in fact under the
supervision of the Union Government and it cannot be contended that
their position is akin to that of the States. Having analysed the relevant
constitutional provisions as also the applicable precedents, we are of
the view that under the scheme of the Indian Constitution, the position
of the Union Territories cannot be equated with that of the States.
Though they do have a separate identity within the constitutional
framework, this will not enable them to avail of the privileges available
to the States.
88. It has been urged before us that the phrase "Union taxation" has
to be interpreted in the context of Article 246, which deals with the
subject-matter of laws made by Parliament and the State Legislatures,
and that the context of "Union taxation" should be limited to those
matters falling within Article 246(1), where Parliament has the
legislative competence to levy taxes with respect to matters
enumerated in the Union List. We see no reason why such a limiting
principle must be read into the definition of the phrase "Union
taxation". In our view, the term can and should be given the widest
amplitude, allowing it to encompass all taxes that are levied by the
authority of parliamentary laws. Though the amplitude of the term
"Union taxation" was not expressly before the Court in the Sea Customs
case¹, it is clear from an analysis of the majority judgments that the
learned Judges considered the term "Union taxation" to mean all taxes
leviable by the Union. As clause (4) of Article 246 itself envisages
situations where Parliament is to make laws in respect of matters in the
State List, it cannot be said that this is a rare or an unusual
circumstance. The Constitution does not contain any provision which
would indicate that the definition of "Union taxation" should be
restrictively interpreted so as to be within the confines of Article 246
(1). The specific situations envisaged in Articles 249, 250, 252, 253
and the Emergency Provisions in Part XVIII of the Constitution do not
make for the
creation of any anomalous situations. These articles, which provide for
unusual exercises of parliamentary power involving the matters
enumerated in the State List, can be regarded as exceptions to the
general rule. We are, therefore, of the view that, unless the context
requires otherwise - as in the case of Articles 249, 250, 252, 253 and
the Emergency Provisions in Part XVIII of the Constitution - the broad
definition of "Union taxation" embracing all taxes leviable by Parliament
ought to be accepted for the purpose of interpreting Article 289(1).
89. As already noticed by us, under the scheme of the 1935 Act,
those lands or buildings of the Provinces and Federated States which
were situated within the Chief Commissioner's Provinces were, by virtue
of Section 155(1), exempted from Federal taxation. There can be no
dispute about such a construction of the provision for, otherwise, the
exemption in Section 155(1) would have no meaning. Section 155(1)
formed the basis for the present Article 289(1) and, having closely
examined the various stages by which Article 289(1) replaced Section
155(1), we find that this position was never sought to be deviated
from. The presumption, therefore, is that it was the intention of the
Framers of the Constitution to maintain the status quo with respect to
the position regarding the Chief Commissioner's Provinces which are
now called "Union Territories". That presumption is further reinforced by
the general scheme of the Constitution which furthers the interpretation
that we have sought to give to Article 289(1) and its applicability in
respect of the Union Territories.
90. Unlike other Federations, the Union of India has a sizeable
territory of its own comprising the Union Territories which have been
specified in the First Schedule to the Constitution. Therefore, the
limited reciprocal inter-governmental immunity bestowed by the
Constitution in Articles 285 and 289 is given fuller meaning by virtue of
the adoption of the wider meaning of "Union taxation"; this would mean
that, just as the properties of the Union are exempt from taxes on
property leviable by the States, the properties of the States will also be
exempt from taxes on property leviable by the Union in areas falling
within its territorial jurisdiction.
91. While attempting to demonstrate that the reasoning of Sinha,
C.J. in the Sea Customs case1 was incorrect insofar as his acceptance of
the contention that Article 246(4) enables Parliament to levy taxes
directly on property was concerned, Mr B. Sen contended that Article
246(4) was not in the contemplation of the Framers of the Constitution
when they carved out the exemption in favour of the property of the
States from Union taxation; he then proceeded to cite examples of
specific circumstances in which Parliament can levy taxes directly on
property which, according to him, was what the Framers had intended
to exempt under Article 289(1). He drew our attention to Entry 3 of the
Union List ["Delimitation of cantonment areas, local self-government in
such areas, the constitution and powers within such areas of
cantonment authorities and the regulation of home accommodation
(including the control of rents) in such areas"] and stated that by virtue
of this entry, Parliament is rendered competent to levy taxes on the use
or occupation of properties located within areas declared as
cantonments. He then referred to Entry 54 of the Union List
("Regulation of mines and mineral development to the extent to which
such regulation and development under the control of the Union is
declared by Parliament by law to be expedient in the public interest")
and to the Mines and Minerals (Regulation and Development) Act, 1956
which together empower Parliament to levy taxes on mines and
minerals which would be in the nature of a tax on property. Referring to
Entry 49 of the Union List ("Patents, Inventions and Designs;
copyright; trade marks and merchandise marks"), Mr Sen contended
that since these subjects are regarded as intangible or incorporeal
properties, taxes levied by Parliament upon them would also amount to
taxes on property. Additionally, Mr Sen has referred to the following
entries in the Union List : Entries 24 and 25 (relating to shipping
activities), Entry 47 ("Insurance"), Entry 52 ("Industries, the control of
which by the Union is declared by Parliament by law to be in the public
interest") : to demonstrate that Parliament does have power to levy
taxes directly on property.
92. Mr A.K. Ganguli controverted Mr Sen's contention in this respect;
he argued that Entry 3 of the Union List does not contemplate the levy
of taxes by Parliament. With respect to Entries 47 and 54, he argued
that these entries would be covered by Article 289(2) of the
Constitution. The same contention would, presumably, be applicable in
respect of the other entries cited by Mr Sen.
93. In our opinion, there is no warrant for an authoritative
pronouncement upon this aspect for, even if we assume that Mr Sen's
contention is correct and that all these entries do in fact empower
Parliament to levy taxes directly on property, it would not in any way
detract from the correctness of our interpretation that the levy of taxes
under Article 246(4) is covered by the phrase "Union taxation" in Article
289(1); these entries would then provide additional areas in respect of
which the States can claim exemption from Union taxation under Article
289(1), thus lending greater weight to the solemnity and the actual
worth, in real terms, of the phraseology of Article 289(1).
94. However, we find ourselves unable to agree with Mr Sen when he
contends that the entries cited by him were the only instances kept in
contemplation by the framers at the time of the drafting of Article 289
(1). If that were so, the ambit of the exemption would traverse an
extremely narrow field which would then lend credence to the
observation of Das, J. in the Sea Customs case1, albeit made in the
converse context, that the exemption in Article 289(1) would amount to
"much ado about nothing".
Classification of taxes imposed by Municipalities
95. We may now turn to Mr Sen's alternative submission that the
taxes levied by the NDMC under the Act would not be covered by the
exemption in Article 289(1) as that provision cannot be construed to
encompass municipal taxes.
96. To appreciate this contention, we will be required to analyse
certain provisions of the Act as also those of the Constitution. Section
61 of the Act, which is the charging section, at the relevant time,
empowered the Municipality to levy a tax payable by the owner on
lands and buildings subject to, and to the extent of, the qualifying
conditions provided therein. It is clear from an analysis of this provision
that it provides for the levy of a consolidated tax, combining within it
the tax element and the service element. Section 51 of the Act provides
for the constitution of a Municipal Fund and states that all sums
received by the Municipal Committee are to be credited to it. Section 52
of the Act provides the manner in which the sums collected in the
Municipal Fund are to be applied by the Municipal Committee. Our
attention has also been drawn towards analogous provisions in the New
Delhi Municipal Committee (sic Council) Act and the Delhi Municipal
Corporation Act to form the foundation of the argument that, under all
these legislations, the Municipalities have been vested with a great deal
of financial autonomy; they have the power to fix their own budgets,
levy taxes within prescribed limits, collect the proceeds of such
imposition which are to be diverted to Municipal Funds which function
entirely under the supervision of the Committees. It is argued that such
a stance is further reinforced by the introduction of Part IX-A into the
Constitution which allows for municipalities to be vested with
substantial powers, including the power to tax, thereby providing
constitutional support. The argument, therefore, is that now that the
Constitution itself recognises municipal taxes as a separate category of
taxes, they should not be construed to fall within the exemption
provided by Article 289(1). Another limb of this submission is that
while under Article 285, taxes imposed by any "authority within a
State", which would necessarily include municipal taxes, have been
expressly exempted, Article 289 does not provide for any such facility
and, to that extent, taxes levied by Municipalities within the Union
Territories are not covered by the exemption in Article 289(1).
97. We have great difficulty in accepting this assertion. Article 265
of the Constitution emphatically mandates that "no tax shall be levied
or collected except by authority of law". Under the framework of the
Constitution there are two principal bodies which have been vested with
plenary powers to make laws, these being the Union Legislature, which
is described by Article 79 as "Parliament for the Union" and the State
Legislatures, which are described by Article 168 in the singular as
"Legislature of a State". While certain other bodies have been vested
with legislative power, including the power of levying taxes, by the
Constitution for specific purposes, as in the case of District Committees
and Regional Councils constituted under the aegis of the Sixth
Schedule to the Constitution, the plenary power to legislate, especially
in matters relating to
revenue, still vests with the Union and the State Legislatures. Even if
the submission that Municipalities now possess, under Part IX-A of the
Constitution, a higher juridical status is correct, the extension of that
logic to the proposition that they have plenary powers to levy taxes is
not, as is clear from a perusal of the relevant part of Article 243-X of
the Constitution which reads as under:
"243-X. Power to impose taxes by, and Funds of, the
Municipalities. - The Legislature of a State may, by law, -
(a) authorise a Municipality to levy, collect and appropriate
such taxes, duties, tolls and fees in accordance with such
procedure and subject to such limits;
(b)-(d)
*
*
*
as may be specified in the law."
98. Article 243-ZB provides that this provision will be applicable to
Union Territories and the reference to the legislature of a State would
apply, in relation to a Union Territory having a Legislative Assembly, to
that Legislative Assembly.
99. It is, therefore, clear that even under the new scheme,
Municipalities do not have an independent power to levy taxes.
Although they can now be granted more substantial powers than ever
before, they continue to be dependent upon their parent legislatures for
the bestowal of such privileges. In the case of Municipalities within
States, they have to be specifically delegated the power to tax by the
State Legislature concerned. In Union Territories which do not have
Legislative Assemblies of their own, such a power would have to be
delegated by Parliament. Of the rest, those which have Legislative
Assemblies of their own would have to specifically empower
Municipalities within them with the power to levy taxes.
100. We have already held that despite the fact that certain Union
Territories have Legislative Assemblies of their own, they are very much
under the supervision of the Union Government and cannot be said to
have an independent status. Under our constitutional scheme, all
taxation must fall within either of two categories : State taxation or
Union taxation. Since it is axiomatic that taxes levied by authorities
within a State would amount to State taxation, it would appear that the
words "or by any authority within a State" have been added in Article
285(1) by way of abundant caution. It could also be that these words
owe their presence in the provision to historical reasons; it may be
noted that Section 154 of the 1935 Act was similarly worded. The fact
that Article 289(1), which in its phraseology is different from Section
155 of the 1935 Act having been drafted by the Drafting Committee to
meet specific objections, does not contain words similar to those in
Article 285(1), will not in any way further the case of the appellant,
because the phrase "Union taxation" will encompass municipal taxes
levied by Municipalities in Union Territories.
101. Before we part, we must refer to Part IV of the judgment of
Jeevan Reddy, J. where clause (2) of Article 289 has been invoked to
validate the
levy of taxes under the Act and the Delhi Municipal Corporation Act
upon those properties of State Governments which are being occupied
for commercial or trade purposes.
102. At the outset, we must express our great reluctance to deal
with this proposition, for it is not based on any contention advanced by
any of the counsel who appeared before us, either in their written
pleadings or in their oral submissions. This is not because we feel
constrained to restrict ourselves to the parameters prescribed by the
submissions of counsel, but because we feel that the opposite side did
not have a fair opportunity to answer the line of reasoning adopted in
that behalf. The view taken by Reddy, J. has the effect of imposing
considerable tax liabilities upon the properties of the State
Governments and, in our view, it would only be proper that their views
in this behalf be obtained before visiting them with such liability. We
have only the rule of caution in mind which warns that ordinarily, courts
should, particularly in constitutional matters, refrain from expressing
opinions on points not raised or not fully and effectively argued by
counsel on either side.
103. Be that as it may, we must, for the record, express ourselves
on the view taken by Reddy, J. after closely examining it. Reddy, J.
begins his examination of the issue by noting that the Act, the Delhi
Municipal Corporation Act and the New Delhi Municipal Committee (sic
Council) Act contain specific provisions exempting the properties of the
Union from local taxation in accordance with Article 285. It is then
stated that since none of these Acts contain similar exemptions in
favour of the properties of States, it is clear that they purport to levy
taxes on them. This is followed by the observation that though the
States seek an exemption from such levies on the basis of clause (1) of
Article 289, as per the ratio of the AP SRTC case², clause (1) has to be
read in the context of clauses (2) and (3) of that article. This would, it
is stated, lead to the consequence that if a parliamentary law within the
meaning of clause (2) of Article 289 is made, the area covered by that
law would be removed from the field occupied in clause (1); for
support, an analogy is drawn from the decision in Rustom Cavasjee
Cooper V. Union of India¹5
104. Thereafter, the meaning and scope of Article 289 as well as its
underlying objective are ascertained by contrasting it with Section 155
of the 1935 Act. The use of the words "lands and buildings" in Section
155(1) is analysed to arrive at the conclusion that these words were
included to empower the Federal Legislature to levy taxes on lands and
buildings situated within the Chief Commissioner's Provinces. It is then
noted that Article 289 uses the wider expression "property", but that
the same reasoning holds good for the present Union Territories,
making the property and income of States situated within Union
Territories exempt from "Union taxation". With respect to the proviso to
Section 155(1), it is observed that
the provision was automatically applicable on its own force. It did not
define the trading and business operations of Provincial Governments,
nor did it specify which of these operations would be subject to Federal
taxation. It is then stated that the same position continues in Article
289 with the only difference being the requirement of the enactment of
a law by Parliament in this behalf. Thereafter, it is observed that the
exemption in clause (1) of Article 289 is subject to clause (2) of Article
289. Clause (2) is analysed and interpreted as clarifying clause (1) to
the extent that the exemption upon the income of Provincial
Government operates only when such income is carried on for the
purpose of governmental functions and not for trade and business
activities, carried on with the profit motive. It is stated that though
"trade and business" ordinarily has a very wide and ambiguous
meaning (certain English and Indian authorities are cited to illustrate
this point), but, for the purposes of clause (2) of Article 289, they have
to be given a restricted meaning. It is, therefore, stated that under
Article 289(2), the trading and business activities of State
Governments, which are carried on with the profit motive, will be liable
to tax and cannot avail of the exemptions in Article 289(1).
105. Clause (2) is further analysed and is interpreted as having
been included for the purpose of removing the trading and business
activities of State Governments from the purview of the exemption in
clause (1). However, it is stated, such a removal is not automatic and is
dependent upon the enactment of a parliamentary law which imposes
taxes on specified trading and business activities of State
Governments.
106. Thereafter, the question whether Parliament has, in exercise of
powers under Article 289(2), imposed taxes on the trading and
business activities of State Governments, is sought to be addressed. In
this respect, the Act, the New Delhi Municipal Committee (sic Council)
Act and the Delhi Municipal Corporation Act, which are deemed to be
post-constitutional enactments, are examined. It is noted that while
these enactments contain specific exemptions in favour of properties of
the Union and also exempt properties used for "charitable purposes"
and "public worship", they do not exempt properties of State
Governments. It is stated that the latter omission must be deemed to
be deliberate. Thereafter, it is stated that two views are possible in this
regard. The first is to adopt the position that since neither of these
enactments are purported to have been made under Article 289(2),
they should not be treated as having been enacted for that purpose
and, consequently, should be held to be incapable of levying taxes on
any property, whether occupied for governmental or trading purposes,
of the State Governments. The second view, which Reddy, J. adopts, is
to take the position that the doctrine of presumption of constitutionality
of legislations points in favour of holding that the Act and the Delhi
Municipal Corporation Act are laws made by Parliament under Article
289(2), and taxes imposed by them upon the properties occupied for
trading and business activities by State Governments would be valid
and effective. A number of decisions of this Court are cited to show the
jurisprudential basis of this tool of constitutional interpretation. It is
pointed out that though neither of these legislations purport to have
been made under Article 289(2), but, since this is normal practice in
that no legislation specifies the provision of the Constitution that it is
enacted under, this fact need not be overemphasised. It is, therefore,
held that the levy of property taxes by these enactments is valid to the
extent that it relates to lands and buildings owned by State
Governments and used by them for trade and business purposes. [In
an earlier part of the opinion, the difficulty in drawing a distinction
between governmental and business functions is noted and an example
in respect of guest houses maintained by State Governments is
supplied.] Thereafter, it is stated that it is for the "appropriate
assessing authority" to determine "which land/building falls within
which category in accordance with law and take appropriate further
action". It is then stated that since, under these enactments, the
assessing authorities are required to decide several difficult questions
as to what amounts to "charitable purpose" etc., the obligation imposed
by such directions would not prove to be too onerous to discharge.
Reddy, J. sums up the issue by recommending to the Union that it
consider granting a total exemption in favour of all properties of State
Governments.
107. We are of the opinion that of the two possible views expressed
by Reddy, J., it is the first which ought to be preferred. We think that
the second view is fraught with several difficulties. Such a construction,
while being violative of the scheme envisaged by the Framers of the
Constitution, may well result in a situation that was sought to be
avoided by them. The directions may also lead to grave practical
difficulties; moreover, since the effect of the directions would be to vest
the executive authorities with substantial policy-making powers, their
issuance might well be offensive to established principles of delegation
of powers.
108. We shall now set out the reasons which cause us to so think; in
doing so, we may have to revisit some of the ground that has already
been traversed by us, but the repetition can be justified by the
narrower focus that will now be imparted to those aspects.
109. Articles 285 and 289, and their predecessors in the 1935 Act,
owe their origin to the American doctrine of Inter-governmental Tax
Immunity. This doctrine was enunciated in the case of McCulloch V.
Maryland11 However, the doctrine was substantially modified by the
decision in South Carolina V. United States12 which drew a distinction
between strictly governmental and business functions of governments.
In the latter case, it was held that the governmental functions of State
Governments would be exempt from Federal taxation but their
commercial functions would be subject to the levy of Federal taxes. This
case imposed upon courts the heavy burden of determining in specific
cases when a particular function was or was not governmental. A
number of conflicting decisions were
rendered and caused a great deal of confusion as to which of the
activities of governments were to be classified as "business" or
"proprietary" and were, therefore, to be liable to Federal taxation. The
controversy was set at rest by a unanimous decision of the U.S.
Supreme Court in New York V. United States16 wherein it was concluded
that the artificial distinction between governmental and
proprietary/business functions of States was unworkable and required
to be abandoned.
110. The difficulty in determining the distinction between a
governmental function and a trading or business function of the State
has also been felt and recognised in Australia. In South Australia V.
Commonwealth^ the changing character of government functions of
the State was noted and it was held that : (CLR at p. 423) "In a fully
self-government country where a Parliament determines legislative
policy and an executive government carries it out, any activity may
become a function of government if Parliament so determines." The
Court in this decision came to the conclusion that the best way to avoid
the controversy was to allow Parliament to decide, by law, which of the
activities of the State would be classified as relating to business and
would consequently be liable to taxation.
111. Under the predecessor of Article 289, i.e., under proviso (a) to
Sections 155(1) of the 1935 Act, the Federal Government was
empowered to levy taxes on lands and buildings of Provincial
Governments used by them for trade or business. The provision itself
vested the Federal Government with the power to levy such taxes and
there was no requirement for the enactment of a specific law in that
behalf. This position continued till the Constitution came into force.
112. When Sir B.N. Rau prepared his Draft Constitution, clause 207
(present Article 289) was drafted on the basis of Section 155 of the
1935 Act. An attempt was made to incorporate the U.S. position
prevailing after the decision in the South Carolina case¹2 by stipulating
that all trading activities of State Governments would be liable to Union
taxation. However, even under this provision, the power to tax was
automatic and did not require a specific law. [See : A Note on certain
clauses by the Constitutional Adviser, B. Shiva Rao, Vol. III, at pp. 204
-205.]
113. The Expert Committee on Financial Provisions, however,
recommended that quasi-trading activities of State Governments
should be exempt from Union taxation. [See : Report of the Expert
Committee, B. Shiva Rao, Vol. III, at p. 266.]
114. Even when the Drafting Committee incorporated the provision
as Draft Article 266 and subsequently modified it, there was no
stipulation for a law before the power to tax could be exercised. [See
the text of Draft Article 266, B. Shiva Rao, Vol. IV, p. 676.] At the
Premiers' Conference held in July
1949, the provision met with severe criticism. The Premier of the United
Provinces suggested that all trading and business activities of State
Governments be exempt from Union taxation. Several other Provinces
also made similar representations. Based on these representations, the
Drafting Committee made a substantial change in the text of Draft
Article 266. A provision similar to the present Article 289(2), whereby
Parliament would have the power to determine which of the trading and
business activities of State Governments would be liable to Union
taxation was incorporated. [See : Revised draft by the Ministry of
Finance, B. Shiva Rao, Vol. IV, pp. 731-32.]
115. When Draft Article 266 was discussed in the Assembly, a
number of members expressed fears that Union taxation of commercial
activities of State Governments would check the expansion of
industrialisation and reduce the capacity of States to perform their
ordinary functions. They, therefore, demanded that the trading and
business activities of State Governments be exempt from Union
taxation. Alladi Krishnaswamy Ayyar sought to allay these
apprehensions by making an elaborate statement, the relevant part of
which is quoted below [Constituent Assembly Debates, Vol. IX, pp.
1167-69]:
"
It is a permissive power that is given to Parliament under the
section. There is no duty cast upon Parliament to levy a tax and I am
sure in the larger interest of trade and industry, Parliament will
certainly not go to the length of taxing industries which have been
thriving.
So far as the United States is concerned in the early days
though there was no express provision through the medium of the
doctrine of Instrumentality, they held that the State cannot tax the
Federal Government and the Federal Government cannot tax the
State instrumentality because both are parts of a single composite
mechanism and if you permit one to tax the other, it may destroy
the whole mechanism. Later, the doctrine of Instrumentality itself
was felt to be not in the large interest of the State, and quite
recently the swing of the pendulum is the other way. The other day
one of the most enlightened of Supreme Court Judges held in what
is known as the Spring of the State of New York, in regard to certain
springs which were worked by the State of New York - for this part
of business they held that there is no immunity of the State from
tax. They said:
'You have to draw some line between one kind of activity of a
State and another kind of activity. Of course it cannot be a rigid
definition. What may be in one sphere may easily pass into
another sphere with the progress of the State and with the
development of the polity in the particular State.'
[In all probability, this is a reference to the opinion of Frankfurter,
J. in New York V. United States16 which upheld the application of a
Federal Excise Tax to the sale of mineral waters bottled by the State
of New York
with a view to providing funds for a State health resort.) ... [N]ormally
speaking, you cannot regard at the present day under existing
conditions the carrying on of trade and business as a normal or ordinary
function of the Government. It may develop into ordinary function -
certain aspects of it, especially the transport service and certain key
industries, may soon become the parts of the State enterprise.
Parliament will take note of the progressive tendency of the particular
times and may at once declare accordingly. It might not have been the
ordinary function of Government before. Now it may become an
ordinary function. There will be sufficient elasticity in clause (3) to
enable the Government to exempt from taxation particular trades or
industries which are started as public utility services or declare them as
regular State industries. Nobody can question a law made by
Parliament because Parliament has stated that a particular industry is
an ordinary function of the State whereas according to the notions of an
individual economist A or B it is not an ordinary function of a
Government. Parliament will lay down the law of the land and it will be
the sole arbiter of the question as to whether it is an ordinary function
of Government or not.
Therefore having regard:
(a) to the plenary power of Parliament to exempt any particular
industries, and particular business from the operation of the tax
provision.
(b) having regard to the fact that it is not obligatory on
Parliament to levy any tax.
(c) that the very conception of State industry may change with
the further evolution of the State and changing times, and
(d) to the interconnection between one State and another.
it will be very difficult to differentiate between particular States, between States
which have been working certain industries and other States.
[T]o lay down a
general principle of law that even at the present day before the provinces are on
their feet every trade or business is exempt from taxation will lead to wild-goose
schemes being started by various provinces. They may not take into account the
general interests of the trade and industry in the whole country. They may not
have regard to the difference between one kind of industry and another. Under
those circumstances the particular provision which has been inserted by Dr
Ambedkar is a very salutary one and is consistent with the most advanced
principles of democratic and federal policy in all the countries."
(comment and emphasis supplied)
116. It is, therefore, clear that clause (2) of Article 289 was a well-
considered compromise which was arrived at after balancing the
demands of those who sought complete exemption of commercial
activities of State Governments from Union taxation and those who
were in favour of levying such Union taxes. The Framers desired that
the issue whether the trading and
business activities of State Governments should be subject to Union
taxation, be left to the wisdom of Parliament. As is evident from the
reference to New York V. United States16 16 in the extracted portion, the
Framers were conscious of the difficulty in drawing a line between the
governmental and commercial functions of State Governments and they
hoped that Parliament would take into account a host of relevant factors
before enacting a law which would specify the trading activities of State
Governments making them liable to Union taxation. It is important to
note that the Framers did not expressly confer upon the Union the
power to tax commercial activities of State Governments. The exercise
of such a power is made conditional upon the enactment of a special,
duly considered, legislation. It is also important to note that clause (2)
of Article 289 has made a departure from the proviso to Section 155(1).
Under the present scheme, the power to tax is not automatic and the
responsibility of specifying the trading and business activities of State
Governments which would be liable to Union taxation is expressly
vested in Parliament.
117. Neither the Act, which is a 1911 enactment, nor the Delhi
Municipal Corporation Act, can qualify as laws under Article 289. They
do not specify which of the trading activities of State Governments are
liable to taxation; indeed, by their very nature, they cannot purport to
do so. It must be remembered that the Act and the Delhi Municipal
Corporation Act are not parliamentary laws in the sense envisaged by
Article 289(2). Though the Act is sought to be construed as a post-
constitutional, parliamentary enactment, the fact remains that it is a
pre-constitutional, colonial legislation. As for the Delhi Municipal
Corporation Act, it is, in essence, an ordinary municipal legislation.
What makes it special is the fact, occasioned in its case by geographical
and historical factors, that it was enacted by Parliament instead of by a
State Legislature. In this regard, we may recall the submissions of the
learned Attorney General in respect of how Parliament discharges its
obligation towards enacting laws for Union Territories. After stating that
Parliament cannot afford to undertake threadbare discussions before
legislating for Union Territories, the learned Attorney General referred
us to the following passage of the decision of this Court in Ramesh
"[Union Territories] are territories situated in the midst of
contiguous territories which have a proper legislature. They are small
territories falling under the legislative jurisdiction of Parliament
which has hardly sufficient time to look after the details of all their
legislative needs and requirements. To require or expect Parliament
to legislate for them will entail a disproportionate pressure on its
legislative schedule. It will also mean the unnecessary utilisation of
the time of a large number of members of Parliament for, except the
few (less than ten) members returned to Parliament from the Union
Territory, none else is likely to be
interested in such legislation. In such a situation, the most convenient
course of legislating for them is the adaptation, by extension, of laws in
force in other areas of the country. As Fazl Ali, J. pointed out in the
Delhi Laws Act case18 , it is not a power to make laws that is delegated
but only a power to 'transplant' laws already in force after having
undergone scrutiny by Parliament or one of the State legislatures, and
that too, without any material change."
(emphasis supplied)
118. It is, therefore, clear that it would be quite dangerous to
assume that when Parliament enacted the Delhi Municipal Corporation
Act, it had intended that the enactment should secure the purpose
enshrined in Article 289(2). If any safe assumption is to be drawn, it is
this : in all probability, while enacting the Delhi Municipal Corporation
Act, Parliament must have "transplanted" a municipal legislation
existing in a certain State, made the necessary changes and completed
the procedural formalities. That would explain why the Delhi Municipal
Corporation Act (as also the New Delhi Municipal Committee (sic
Council) Act) contains an exemption on the lines of the one prescribed
by Article 285 - this is a typical feature of ordinary municipal
legislations, which are enacted by State Legislatures who are conscious
of the mandate of Article 285. Moreover, such legislations do not
contain exemptions in favour of properties of State Governments
because, within the territory of a State, the properties of other State
Governments are liable to taxation. So, when such a legislation is
"transplanted" almost verbatim into a Union Territory, it will obviously
not contain an exemption in favour of properties of State Governments.
In the face of the actual conditions which govern the enactment of laws
for Union Territories by Parliament, (these conditions have been
statutorily provided; moreover this Court has already taken notice of
them) it is difficult to assume that the omission of an exemption in the
Delhi Municipal Corporation Act in favour of State Governments, is
deliberate. The Act and the Delhi Municipal Corporation Act cannot,
therefore, be said to meet the special requirements which have been
expressed by the Framers to be necessary for complying with the spirit
of Article 289(2).
119. Reddy, J. has taken the view that the Doctrine of Presumption
of Constitutionality of Legislations requires the saving of the taxes
which these Acts impose upon the commercial activities of State
Governments. The Act is a pre-constitutional enactment. The basis of
this doctrine is the assumed intention of the legislators not to
transgress constitutional boundaries. It is difficult to appreciate how
that intention can be assumed when, at the time that the law was
passed, there was no such barrier and the limitation was brought in by
a Constitution long after the enactment of the law. (This Court has in a
Constitution Bench decision, Gulabbhai Vallabbhai Desai V. Union of
India¹9 (AIR at p. 1117 raised doubts along similar lines). The Framers
obviously wanted the law under Article 289(2) to be of a very high
standard.
Can these laws, which are silent on the most important aspect required
by Article 289(2), i.e., the specification of the trading activities of State
Governments which would be liable to Union taxation, be said to meet
with that standard?
120. The Doctrine of Presumption of Constitutionality of Legislations
is not one of infinite application; it has recognised limitations. It is
settled law that if any interpretation is possible which will save an Act
from the attack of unconstitutionality, that interpretation should always
be accepted in preference to an alternative interpretation that might
also be possible, under which the statute would be void. However, this
Court has consistently followed a policy of not putting an unnatural and
forced meaning on the words that have been used by the legislature in
the search for an interpretation which would save the statutory
provisions. We are not "free to stretch or pervert the language of the
enactment in the interests of any legal or constitutional theory". [See
Central Provinces & Berar Act No. XIV of 1938, Re 20 (FCR at p. 37); also
see : Diamond Sugar Mills Ltd. V. State of U.P. 21 (SCR at pp. 248-49).]
121. The Act and the Delhi Municipal Corporation Act are ordinary
municipal legislations. They do not, and cannot, purport to be laws
made by Parliament under Article 289(2). There is no reason why such
a strained reasoning should be employed to save some of the taxes that
may be capable of being imposed on certain properties of State
Governments. There seems to be no pressing reason for invoking the
doctrine. Reddy, J. has, in the earlier part of his opinion, held that a
large number of properties of State Governments would be exempt
from taxes leviable under these Acts due to the operation of Article 289
(1). To employ such reasoning to construe Article 289(2) in a bid to
save what would only be a reduced amount, does not seem justified.
122. The practical effect of the directions recommended by Reddy, J.
is also worth noticing. It is abundantly clear that the task of
determining which of the activities of Governments are governmental
and which are commercial, is an extremely difficult one. Reddy, J.
entrusts this assignment to the "assessing authorities under the Acts"
who can only be municipal authorities. This is an issue which has
confounded courts in the U.S. and in Australia for several years. This
issue was considered to be so troublesome by the Framers that they
entrusted it to Parliament in the hope that it would fully deliberate the
matter before enacting a comprehensive legislation.
123. In the Delhi Laws Act case, Re18, this Court authoritatively held
that the legislature cannot delegate its essential policy-making
function. Over the years, this Court has elaborated this proposition to
hold that the legislature can delegate some of its legislative functions
provided it lays down the policy in clear terms. The legislature is
required to declare the
policy of law in unambiguous terms, lay down elaborate legal principles
and provide illuminating standards for the guidance of the delegate.
Even though this Court has, on occasions, sanctioned very broad
delegations of taxing power to municipal bodies, to delegate the task of
carving out the distinction between governmental and business
functions of State Governments to municipal authorities would clearly
18
be against the interdiction in the Delhi Laws Act case as the
assignment requires not only the making of policy, but indeed, the
making of very difficult and challenging policy choices. Reddy, J. has
noted that the Delhi Municipal Corporation Act provides exemptions in
favour of activities that are capable of being classified as "charitable
purpose", "public worship" etc. and states that to ascertain the ambit of
these categories is an equally difficult task which is already being
discharged by the assessing authorities. However, the point that needs
to be emphasised, is that Section 115 of the Delhi Municipal
Corporation Act defines these terms and provides guidelines in respect
thereof. However, there is no provision in the Delhi Municipal
Corporation Act which states that the trading and business operations
of State Governments would be subject to property taxes. The Act is
equally silent on this aspect. Consequently, no guidelines in this behalf
are to be found within the parameters of these legislations. Under these
circumstances, in the complete absence of any statutory policy or any
guidelines for the delegation of such a policy, we believe that it would
be impermissible and hazardous to directly assign such a function, nay
power, to executive municipal authorities.
124. The decision whether the properties of State Governments
occupied for commercial purposes should be subject to the levy of
Union taxes is one that is required by Article 289(2) to be made by a
legislation which specifies the activities which would be liable to tax.
This decision cannot be entrusted to municipal functionaries. For these
reasons, we find ourselves unable to agree with Reddy, J. in his finding
that the properties of State Governments occupied by them for trade or
business purposes are subject to the levy of taxes under the Act and
the Delhi Municipal Corporation Act.
125. We may now summarise our conclusions:
(i) The central issue in the present matter, namely, whether the
properties owned by the States which are situated within Union
Territories are exempt from paying property taxes, was specifically
answered in the affirmative in the Sea Customs case1 the
observations in this regard are part of the ratio decidendi of the case
and having been reaffirmed by a Constitution Bench which was
hearing a litigation inter partes in the AP SRTC case' 2 , they constitute
good law;
(ii) The definition of "State" provided in Section 3(58) of the
General Clauses Act, which declares that the word "State" would
include "Union Territory", is inapplicable to Article 246(4);
(iii) The term "Union taxation" used in Article 289(1) will
ordinarily mean "all taxes leviable by the Union" and it includes
within its ambit taxes on property levied within Union Territories;
therefore, the States can avail of the exemption provided in Article
289(1) in respect of their properties situated within Union
Territories;
(iv) Property taxes levied by municipalities within Union
Territories are properly within the ambit of the exemption provided
in Article 289(1) and the States can avail of the exemption.
126. In the result, the civil appeals and the special leave petitions
are dismissed. There shall be no order as to costs.
B.P. JEEVAN REDDY, J. (on behalf of himself, Anand, Sen,
Paripoornan and Kirpal, JJ.)- Article 289(1) of the Constitution of India
declares that the "property and income of a State shall be exempt from
Union taxation". The question in this batch of appeals is whether the
properties of the States situated in the Union Territory of Delhi are
exempt from property taxes levied under the municipal enactments in
force in the Union Territory of Delhi. The Delhi High Court has taken the
view that they are. That view is challenged in these appeals preferred
by the New Delhi Municipal Council and the Delhi Municipal Corporation.
128. Leave granted in the special leave petitions.
129. Prior to 1911-12, a large part of the territory now comprised in
the Union Territory of Delhi was a district of the Province of Punjab. By
a proclamation dated 17-9-1912, the Governor General took the said
territory under his immediate authority and management, to be
administered as a separate Province to be known as the Province of
Delhi. (This was in connection with the decision to shift the Capital from
Calcutta to Delhi.) In the same year, the Delhi Laws Act, 1912 (1912
Act) was enacted. It came into force on and with effect from the Ist day
of October, 1912. Schedule A to the Act defined the "territory" covered
by the new Province. Sections 2 and 3 of the 1912 Act provided inter
alia that the creation of the new Province of Delhi shall not effect any
change in the territorial application of any enactment. One of the Acts
so applying to the territory comprised in the new Province of Delhi was
the Punjab Municipal Act, 1911.
130. In the year 1915, another Act called "The Delhi Laws Act,
1915" (1915 Act) was enacted. Under this enactment, certain areas
formerly comprised in the United Provinces of Agra and Oudh were
included in and added to the Province of Delhi with effect from 1-4-
1915. Section 2 of the 1915 Act also contained a saving clause similar
to Section 2 of the 1912 Act.
131. In the Constitution of India, as originally enacted, the First
Schedule contained four categories of States, viz., Part 'A', Part 'B', Part
'C' and Part 'D'. Part 'D' comprised only of Andaman and Nicobar
Islands. The Chief Commissioner's Province of Delhi was one of the Part
'C' States. By virtue of the Part 'C' States (Laws) Act, 1950, the laws in
force in the erstwhile Chief Commissioner's Province of Delhi were
continued in the
Part 'C' State of Delhi. This Act came into force on the 16th day of April,
1950.
132. In the year 1951, Parliament enacted the Government of Part
'C' States Act, 1951. This Act contemplated that there shall be a
legislature for each of the Part 'C' States specified therein which
included Delhi. Section 21 stated that the legislature of a Part 'C' State
shall have the power to make laws with respect to any of the matters
enumerated in List II and List III of the Seventh Schedule to the
Constitution. In the case of Delhi Legislature, however, it was provided
that it shall not have power to make laws with respect to matters
specified therein including "the constitution and powers of municipal
corporations and other local authorities, of improvement trusts and of
water supply, drainage, electricity, transport and other public utility
authorities in Delhi or in New Delhi". Section 22 provided that any law
made by the legislature of a Part 'C' State shall, to the extent of
repugnancy with any law made by Parliament, whether enacted earlier
or later, be void. It is necessary to notice the two distinctive features of
the legislatures of Part 'C' States; not only were they created under an
Act made by Parliament, the laws made by them even with respect to
any of the matters enumerated in List II were subject to any law made
by Parliament. In case of repugnancy, the law made by legislature was
to be of no effect. So far as Delhi is concerned, Parliament placed
certain additional fetters referred to in Section 26.
133. It is stated that in the year 1952, a legislature was created for
Delhi which functioned up to 1-11-1956 when the Government of Part
'C' States Act, 1951 was repealed by Section 130 of the States
Reorganisation Act, 1956. While repealing the Government of Part 'C'
States Act, 1951, the States Reorganisation Act, 1956 did not provide
for the creation or continuance of legislatures for the Part 'C' States.
The legislature constituted for Delhi thus came to an end.
134. By the Constitution Seventh (Amendment) Act, 1956, some of
the Part 'C' States ceased to exist, having been merged in one or the
other State while some others continued - designated as Union
Territories. The categorisation of the States into Parts A, B, C and D was
done away with. In its place, the First Schedule came to provide only
two categories, viz., "(i) the States" and "(ii) the Union Territories". The
Seventh (Amendment) Act specified six Union Territories, viz., Delhi,
Himachal Pradesh, Manipur, Tripura, Andaman and Nicobar Islands and
Laccadive, Minicoy and Amindivi Islands. Delhi thus became a Union
Territory. With the inclusion of Goa and other former Portuguese
territories in the Union, the number of Union Territories grew to eight
by 1962. In that year, the Constitution Fourteenth (Amendment) Act,
1962 was enacted. Pondicherry was added as a Union Territory at SI.
No. 9. More important, the said Amendment Act introduced Article 239-
A. The new article provided that "Parliament may by law create for any
of the Union Territories of Himachal Pradesh, Manipur, Tripura, Goa,
Daman and Diu and Pondicherry, a body, whether elected or partly
nominated, and partly elected to function as a legislature for the
Union Territory, or a council of ministers, or both with such
constitutional powers and functions in each case, as may be specified in
the law" (emphasis added). It is significant to note that the said article
did not provide for creation of a legislature or a council of ministers, as
the case may be, for the Union Territory of Delhi.
135. Pursuant to Article 239-A, Parliament enacted the Government
of Union Territories Act, 1963 (1963 Act). Obviously, this Act applied
only to those Union Territories as were referred to in Article 239-A. It
did not apply to Delhi. This Act provided for creation of Legislative
Assemblies for the Union Territories mentioned in Article 239-A and the
extent of their legislative power. Section 3(1) declared that "there shall
be a Legislative Assembly for each Union Territory" whereas Section 18
(1) provided that "subject to the provisions of this Act, the Legislative
Assembly of a Union Territory may make laws for the whole or any part
of the Union Territory with respect to any of the matters enumerated in
the State List or the Concurrent List in the Seventh Schedule to the
Constitution insofar as any such matter is applicable in relation to Union
Territories." Sub-section (2) of Section 18 read with Section 21,
however, conferred overriding power upon Parliament to make any law
with respect to any matter for a Union Territory or any part thereof. In
case of inconsistency between a law made by Parliament and a law
made by the legislature of any of these Union Territories, the latter was
to be void to the extent of repugnancy, notwithstanding whether the
parliamentary law was earlier or subsequent in point of time. Section
19 of the Act exempted the property of the Union from all taxes
imposed by or under any law made by the Legislative Assembly of a
Union Territory except insofar as is permitted by a law made by
Parliament.
136. By the Constitution Sixty-Ninth (Amendment) Act, 1991,
Article 239-AA was introduced in Part VIII of the Constitution. This
article renamed the Union Territory of Delhi as the "National Capital
Territory of Delhi" and provided that there shall be a Legislative
Assembly for such National Capital Territory. The Legislative Assembly
so created was empowered by clause (3) of the said article
"to make laws for the whole or any part of the National Capital Territory with
respect to any of the matters enumerated in the State List or in the Concurrent List
insofar as any such matter is applicable to Union Territories except matters with
respect to Entries 1, 2 and 18 of the State List and Entries 64, 65 and 66 of that
List insofar as they relate to the said Entries 1, 2 and 18".
Clause (3) further provided that the power conferred upon the
Legislative Assembly of Delhi by the said article shall not derogate from
the powers of Parliament "to make laws with respect to any matter for a
Union Territory or any part thereof". It further provided that in the case
of repugnancy, the law made by Parliament shall prevail, whether the
parliamentary law is earlier or later to the law made by the Delhi
Legislative Assembly. Parliament is also
empowered to amend, vary or repeal any law made by the Legislative
Assembly. Article 239-AA came into force with effect from 1-2-1992.
Pursuant to the article, Parliament enacted the Government of National
Capital Territory of Delhi Act, 1991. It not only provided for constitution
of a Legislative Assembly but also its powers as contemplated by Article
239-AA. This Act too came into force on 1-2-1992. The subordinate
status of the Delhi Legislature is too obvious to merit any emphasis.
137. So far as the Municipal Laws governing the Territory of Delhi
are concerned, the following is the position : by Delhi Laws Act, 1912,
referred to supra, the Punjab Municipal Act continued to govern the
territory comprised in the Chief Commissioner's Province of Delhi. The
Act is stated to have been extended to Part 'C' State of Delhi under a
notification issued under Part 'C' State (Laws) Act, 1950. In the
impugned judgment, the High Court has stated the following facts:
"The various Punjab enactments which were then in force in the
territory of Delhi continued to be in force by virtue of the Delhi Laws
Act of 1912 and later by the Part C States Laws Act of 1950 and the
Union Territories Laws Act of 1950. The application and the later
extension of this law to the Union Territory of Delhi was, therefore,
not by the authority of the State Legislature but that of the Central
Legislature, that is, the Central Legislature under the Government of
India Act followed by the Central Legislature under the Constitution
of India, that is, Parliament of India.
The Delhi Laws Act, 1912,
the Union Territories (Laws) Act, 1950 as indeed the Part C States
(Laws) Act, 1950 were all Central statutes and when a Provincial Act
or an Act which may be treated as a Provincial Act or State Act was
extended to a territory by a particular legislature, it would be
deemed to be the enactment of such a legislature and this principle
is clearly recognised by the Supreme Court in the case of Mithan Lal
V.
State
of
Delhi²2.
It is thus clear that on the extension of the Act
to the Union Territory of Delhi by the various Central Legislative
enactments referred to above, it became a Central Act or an Act of
Parliament as if made by virtue of power of Parliament to legislate for
the Union Territory of Delhi by virtue of clause (4) of Article 246 of
the Constitution of India."
138. The correctness of the above factual statement has not been
disputed by anyone before us. Indeed, the contention of Shri P.P. Rao,
who led the argument on behalf of the respondents-State Governments
was to the same effect. He contended that inasmuch as the Punjab
Municipal Act has been extended to Part 'C' State of Delhi under the
Part 'C' State (Laws) Act, 1950 with effect from 16-4-1950, it is a post-
constitutional enactment made by Parliament and hence the taxes
levied thereunder constitute Union taxation. He placed strong reliance
upon the decision in Mithan Lal V. State of Delhi22 and also certain
observations in T.M. Kanniyan V. ITO8 in that
behalf. It is obvious that this was also the case of the State
Governments before the Delhi High Court. We, therefore, proceed on
the basis that the Punjab Municipal Act was extended to Part 'C' State
of Delhi under and by virtue of the Part 'C' States (Laws) Act, 1950
which came into force on 16-4-1950.
139. By virtue of the Constitution Seventh (Amendment) Act, 1956,
the Part 'C' State of Delhi was designated as a Union Territory. The
Punjab Municipal Act continued to govern the Union Territory of Delhi.
In the year 1957, Parliament enacted the Delhi Municipality Act, 1957.
The First Schedule to the Act specified the boundaries of New Delhi
within which area the Punjab Municipal Act continued to be in force.
The remaining area was designated as the Delhi Municipal Corporation
area and the Delhi Municipal Corporation Act, 1957 was made
applicable to it. In the year 1994, Parliament enacted the New Delhi
Municipal Council Act, 1994 repealing Punjab Municipal Act, 1911. This
Act has been brought into force with effect from 25-5-1994. It is,
however, confined in its application to the area comprised in the New
Delhi Municipal Council. Delhi and New Delhi are thus governed by
different municipal enactments. The Delhi Municipal Corporation Act
and the New Delhi Municipal Council Act are, without a doubt, post-
constitutional laws enacted by Parliament.
PART II
140. Article 1 (1) of the Constitution of India declares that India, i.e.,
Bharat, shall be a Union of States. As amended by the Constitution
Seventh (Amendment) Act, clauses (2) and (3) of Article 1 read:
"1. (2) The States and the territories thereof shall be as specified
in the First Schedule.
(3) The territory of India shall comprise-
(a) the territories of the States;
(b) the Union Territories specified in the First Schedule; and
(c) such other territories as may be acquired."
141. Clause (30) in Article 366 defines the "Union Territory" in the
following words:
"366. (30) 'Union Territory' means any Union Territory specified in
the First Schedule and includes any other territory comprised with
the territory of India but not specified in that Schedule."
142. The expression "State" is not defined in the Constitution. It is
defined in the General Clauses Act, 1897 which is made applicable to
the interpretation of the Constitution by Article 367. As on the date of
the commencement of the Constitution, clause (58) in Section 3 of the
General Clauses Act defined "State" in the following words:
"3. (58) 'State', - shall mean a Part A State, a Part B State or a
Part C State."
The said definition was amended by the Adaptation of Laws Order No. 1
of 1956 issued by the President in exercise of the power conferred upon
him by
Article 372-A of the Constitution introduced by the Constitution
Seventh (Amendment) Act. The amended definition reads thus:
"3. (58) 'State',-
(a) as respects any period before the commencement of the
Constitution (Seventh Amendment) Act, 1956, shall mean a Part
A State, a Part B State or a Part C State; and
(b) as respects any period after such commencement, shall
mean a State specified in the First Schedule to the Constitution
and shall include a Union Territory."
143. The definitions in the General Clauses Act, it is necessary to
remember, have to be read and applied subject to the opening words in
Section 3, viz., "unless there is anything repugnant in the subject or
context
144. Part XI of the Constitution contains provisions governing
relations between the Union and the States. This part is divided into
two chapters, viz., Chapter I containing Articles 245 to 255 and
Chapter II containing Articles 256 to 2 Chapter I carries the title
"Legislative relations" while Chapter II is called "Administrative
relations". Article 245, which carries the heading/marginal note "Extent
of laws made by Parliament and by the Legislatures of States" contains
two clauses. Clause (1) says "that subject to the provisions of this
Constitution, Parliament may make laws for the whole or any part of the
territory of India and the legislature of a State may make laws for the
whole or any part of the State". Article 246 is of crucial relevance herein
and must, therefore, be set out in its entirety:
"246. Subject-matter of laws made by Parliament and by the
Legislatures of States.-(1) Notwithstanding anything in clauses (2)
and (3), Parliament has exclusive power to make laws with respect
to any of the matters enumerated in List I in the Seventh Schedule
(in this Constitution referred to as the 'Union List').
(2) Notwithstanding anything in clause (3), Parliament, and,
subject to clause (1), the Legislature of any State also, have power
to make laws with respect to any of the matters enumerated in List
III in the Seventh Schedule (in this Constitution referred to as the
'Concurrent List').
(3) Subject to clauses (1) and (2), the Legislature of any State
has exclusive power to make laws for such State or any part thereof
with respect to any of the matters enumerated in List II in the
Seventh Schedule (in this Constitution referred to as the 'State
List').
(4) Parliament has power to make laws with respect to any matter
for any part of the territory of India not included in a State
notwithstanding that such matter is a matter enumerated in the
State List."
(emphasis added)
145. It is relevant to point out that in clauses (2) and (3), as
originally enacted - and up to the Seventh (Amendment) Act - the
expression "State" was followed by the words "specified in Part A or
Part B of the First
Schedule". Similarly, the words, "in a State" in clause (3), were
followed by the words "in Part A or Part B of the First Schedule". In
other words, clauses (2) and (3) of Article 246 expressly excluded Part
'C' and Part 'D' States from their purview. The position is no different
after the Constitution Seventh (Amendment) Act, which designated the
Part C States as Union Territories. They ceased to be States. As rightly
pointed out by a Constitution Bench of this Court in T.M. Kanniyan S, the
context of Article 246 excludes Union Territories from the ambit of the
expression "State" occurring therein. As a matter of fact, this is true of
Chapter I of Part XI of the Constitution as a whole. It may be
remembered that during the period intervening between the
Constitution Seventh (Amendment) Act, 1956 and the Constitution
Fourteenth (Amendment) Act, 1962, there was no provision for a
legislature for any of the Union Territories. Article 239-A in Part VII -
"The Union Territories" - (which before the Seventh Amendment was
entitled "The States in Part C of the First Schedule") introduced by the
Constitution Fourteenth (Amendment) Act did not itself create a
legislature for Union Territories; it merely empowered Parliament to
create them for certain specified Union Territories (excluding Delhi) and
to confer upon them such powers as Parliament may think appropriate.
Thus, the legislatures created for certain Union Territories under the
1963 Act were not legislatures in the sense used in Chapter III of Part
IV of the Constitution, but were mere creatures of Parliament - some
sort of subordinate legislative bodies. They were unlike the legislatures
contemplated by Chapter III of Part VI of the Constitution which are
supreme in the field allotted to them, i.e., in the field designated by
List II of the Seventh Schedule. The legislatures created by the 1963
Act for certain Union Territories owe their existence and derive their
powers from the Act of Parliament and are subject to its overriding
authority. In short, the State Legislatures contemplated by Chapter I of
Part XI are the legislatures of States referred to in Chapter III of Part
VI and not the legislatures of Union Territories created by the 1963 Act.
Union Territories are not States for the purposes of Part XI (Chapter I)
of the Constitution.
146. Article 248 confers the residuary legislative power upon
Parliament. The said power includes the power to make any law
imposing a tax not mentioned in either List II or List III. Articles 249,
250, 252 and 357 confer upon Parliament power to make laws with
respect to matters enumerated in List II in certain exceptional
situations, which may, for the sake of convenience, be called a case of
"substitute legislation". It would be enough to refer to the marginal
headings of these four articles. They read:
"249. Power of Parliament to legislate with respect to a matter in
the State List in the national interest.
250. Power of Parliament to legislate with respect to any matter in
the State List if a Proclamation of Emergency is in operation.
252. Power of Parliament to legislate for two or more States by
consent and adoption of such legislation by any other State.
357. Exercise of legislative powers under Proclamation issued
under Article 356."
We may now set out Articles 285 and 289:
"285. Exemption of property of the Union from State taxation.- -
(1) The property of the Union shall, save insofar as Parliament may
by law otherwise provide, be exempt from all taxes imposed by a
State or by any authority within a State.
(2) Nothing in clause (1) shall, until Parliament by law otherwise
provides, prevent any authority within a State from levying any tax
on any property of the Union to which such property was
immediately before the commencement of this Constitution liable or
treated as liable, so long as that tax continues to be levied in that
State.
289. Exemption of property and income of a State from Union
taxation. -(1) The property and income of a State shall be exempt
from Union taxation.
(2) Nothing in clause (1) shall prevent the Union from imposing,
or authorising the imposition of, any tax to such extent, if any, as
Parliament may by law provide in respect of a trade or business of
any kind carried on by, or on behalf of, the Government of a State, or
any operations connected therewith, or any property used or
occupied for the purposes of such trade or business, or any income
accruing in connection therewith.
(3) Nothing in clause (2) shall apply to any trade or business, or
to any class of trade or business, which Parliament may by law
declare to be incidental to the ordinary functions of Government."
147. A Federation presupposes two coalescing units : the Federal
Government/Centre and the States/Provinces. Each is supposed to be
supreme in the sphere allotted to it/them. Power to tax is an incident of
sovereignty. Basic premise is that one sovereign cannot tax the other
sovereign. Articles 285 and 289 manifest this mutual regard and
immunity but in a manner peculiar to our constitutional scheme. While
the immunity created in favour of the Union is absolute, the immunity
created in favour of the States is a qualified one. We may elaborate
:
Article 285 says that "the property of the Union shall
be exempt from
all taxes imposed by a State or by any authority within a State" unless,
of course, Parliament itself permits the same and to the extent
permitted by it. [Clause (2) of Article 285 saves the existing taxes until
Parliament otherwise provides, but this is only a transitional provision.]
The ban, if it can be called one, is absolute and emphatic in terms.
There is no way a State Legislature can levy a tax upon the property of
the Union. So far as Article 289 is concerned, the position is different.
Clause (1), had it stood by itself, would have been similar to clause (1)
of Article 285. It says that "the property and income of a State shall be
exempt from Union taxation". But it does not stand alone. It is qualified
by
clause (2) and clause (3) is an exception to clause (2). But before we
refer to clause (2), a word with respect to the meaning and ambit of
the expression "property" occurring in this article. Expression
"property" is wide enough to take in all kinds of property. In Sea
Customs Act, 1878, S. 20(2), Re1 all the learned Judges (both majority
and dissenting) were agreed that the expression must be understood in
its widest sense. There is no reason to put a restricted construction
thereon. Indeed, there is no controversy about this proposition before
us. Coming to clause (2), it says that the ban imposed by clause (1)
shall not prevent the Union from imposing or authorising the imposition
of any tax to such extent, if any, as Parliament may by law provide, in
respect of (a) trade or business of any kind carried on by or on behalf of
the Government of a State or (b) any operations connected with such
trade or business or (c) any property used or occupied for the purposes
of such trade or business or (d) any income accruing or arising in
connection with such trade or business. (The inspiration for this
provision may perhaps be found in certain United States' decisions on
the question of the power of the units of a federal polity to tax each
others' properties.) Clause (3) empowers Parliament to declare, by law,
which trade or business or any class of trades or businesses is
incidental to the ordinary functions of the Government, whereupon the
trades/businesses so specified go out of the purview of clause (2).
148. It would be appropriate at this stage to notice the ratio of two
judgments of this Court dealing with Article 289. In Sea Customs Act,
Re1, a Special Bench of nine learned Judges, by a majority, laid down
the following propositions : (a) clause (1) of Article 289 provides for
exemption of property and income of the States only from taxes
imposed directly upon them; it has no application to indirect taxes like
duties of excise and customs; (b) duties of excise and customs are not
taxes on property or income; they are taxes on manufacture/production
of goods and on import/export of goods, as the case may be, and
hence, outside the purview of clause (1) of Article 289. The other
decision in A.P. SRTC V. ITO2 is the decision of a Constitution Bench.
The main holding in this case is that income of the AP SRTC is not the
income of the State of Andhra Pradesh since the former is an
independent legal entity and hence, Article 289(1) does not avail it. At
the same time, certain observations are made in the decision regarding
the scheme of Article 289. It is held that clause (2) is an exception or a
proviso to clause (1) and as such whatever is included in clause (2)
must be deemed to be included in clause (1). In other words, the
trading and business activities referred to in clause (2) are included in
clause (1) and precisely for this reason the exception in clause (2) was
provided. Clause (3), it was held, is an exception to clause (2). In the
words of the Constitution Bench : (SCR p. 25)
"The scheme of Article 289 appears to be that ordinarily, the
income derived by a State both from governmental and non-
governmental or commercial activities shall be immune from income
tax levied by the Union, provided, of course, the income in question
can be said to be the income of the State. This general proposition
flows from clause (1).
Clause (2) then provides an exception and authorises the Union to
impose a tax in respect of the income derived by the Government of
a State from trade or business carried on by it, or on its behalf; that
is to say, the income from trade or business carried on by the
Government of a State or on its behalf which would not have been
taxable under clause (1), can be taxed, provided a law is made by
Parliament in that behalf. If clause (1) had stood by itself, it may not
have been easy to include within its purview income derived by a
State from commercial activities, but since clause (2), in terms,
empowers Parliament to make a law levying a tax on commercial
activities carried on by or on behalf of a State, the conclusion is
inescapable that these activities were deemed to have been included
in clause (1) and that alone can be the justification for the words in
which clause (2) has been adopted by the Constitution. It is plain
that clause (2) proceeds on the basis that but for its provision, the
trading activity which is covered by it would have claimed exemption
from Union taxation under clause (1). That is the result of reading
clauses (1) and (2) together.
Clause (3) then empowers Parliament to declare by law that any
trade or business would be taken out of the purview of clause (2)
and restored to the area covered by clause (1) by declaring that the
said trade or business is incidental to the ordinary functions of
Government. In other words, clause (3) is an exception to the
exception prescribed by clause (2). Whatever trade or business is
declared to be incidental to the ordinary functions of Government,
would cease to be governed by clause (2) and would then be exempt
from Union taxation. That, broadly stated, appears to be the result of
the scheme adopted by the three clauses of Article 289."
PART III
149. The crucial question arising in this batch of appeals pertains to
the meaning of the expression "Union taxation" occurring in Article 289
(1). According to the appellants-municipal corporations, the property
taxes levied either by the Punjab Municipal Act, 1911, as extended to
and applicable in the New Delhi Municipal Council area or by the Delhi
Municipal Corporation Act, 1957 applicable to the Delhi Municipal
Corporation area do not fall within the ambit of the expression "Union
taxation". According to them, "Union taxation" means levy of any of the
taxes mentioned in the Union List (List I in the Seventh Schedule to the
Constitution). May be, it may also take in levy of Stamp duties (which
is the only taxation entry in the Concurrent List) by Parliament, but by
no stretch of imagination, they contend, can levy of any tax provided in
the State List
(List II in the Seventh Schedule) can be characterised as Union
taxation. Merely because Parliament levies the tax provided in List II,
such taxation does not amount to Union taxation. There are many
situations where Parliament is empowered by Constitution to make laws
with respect to matters enumerated in List II. For example, Articles
249, 250, 252 and 357 empower Parliament to make laws with respect
to matters enumerated in List II in certain specified situations. If any
taxes are levied by Parliament while legislating under any of the above
articles, such taxation cannot certainly be termed as "Union taxation".
It would still be State taxation. The levy of taxation by Parliament
within the Union Territories is of a similar nature. Either because the
Union Territory has no legislature or because the Union Territory has a
legislature but Parliament chooses to act in exercise of its overriding
power, the taxes levied by a parliamentary enactment within such
Union Territories would not be Union taxation. It is relevant to notice,
the learned counsel contend, that the legislatures of the Union
Territories referred to in Article 239-A as well as the legislature of Delhi
created by Article 239-AA are empowered to make laws with respect to
any of the matters enumerated in List II and List III of the Seventh
Schedule, just like any other State Legislature; any taxes levied by
these legislatures cannot certainly be characterised as "Union taxation".
Merely because Parliament has been given an overriding power to make
a law with respect to matters enumerated even in List II, in
supersession of the law made by the legislature of the Union Territory,
it does not follow that the law so made is any the less a law belonging
to the sphere of the State. The test in such matters - it is contended
-
is not who makes the law but to which matter in which List does the
law in question pertain. Clause (4) of Article 246 specifically empowers
Parliament to make laws with respect to any matter enumerated in List
II in the case of Union Territories. This shows that even the said clause
recognises the distinction between List I and List II in the Seventh
Schedule, it is submitted.
150. The learned Attorney General appearing for the Union of India
supported the contentions of the appellants-municipal corporations.
151. On the other hand, the contentions of the learned counsel for
the respondents are to the following effect : a Union Territory is not a
"State" within the meaning of Article 246. Even prior to the Seventh
(Amendment) Act, Part 'C' States, or for that matter Part D States,
were not within the purview of the said article. The division of the
legislative powers provided by clauses (1), (2) and (3) of Article 246
has no relevance in the case of a Union Territory. Union Territory, as the
name itself indicates, is a territory belonging to the Union. A Union
Territory has no legislature as contemplated by Part VI of the
Constitution. A Union Territory may have a legislature or may not. Even
if it is bestowed with one, it is not by virtue of the Constitution but by
virtue of parliamentary enactments, e.g., Government of Part 'C' States
Act, 1951 (prior to 1-11-1956) and the Government of Union Territories
Act, 19 Even the legislature provided for Delhi by Article 239-AA of
the Constitution with effect from 1-2-1992 is not a
legislature like that of the States governed by Part VI of the
Constitution. Not only the powers of the legislature are circumscribed
by providing that such legislature cannot make laws with reference to
certain specified entries in List II but any law made by it even with
reference to a matter enumerated in the State List is subject to the law
made by Parliament. In any event, the position obtaining in Delhi after
1-2-1992 is not relevant in these appeals since these appeals pertain to
a period anterior to the said date. The Punjab Municipal Act, 1911 [as
extended and applied to the Union Territory of Delhi by Part 'C' State
(Laws) Act] and the Delhi Municipal Corporation Act, 1957 are
parliamentary laws enacted under and by virtue of the legislative power
vested in Parliament by clause (4) of Article 246. The taxes levied by
the said enactments constitute "Union taxation" within the meaning of
Article 289(1) and hence, the properties of the States in the Union
Territory of Delhi are exempt therefrom. Reliance is placed upon the
majority opinion in Sea Customs Act, Re1 in support of the above
propositions. It is submitted that there are no reasons to take a
different view now.
152. On a consideration of rival contentions, we are inclined to agree
with the respondents-States. The States put together do not exhaust
the territory of India. There are certain territories which do not form
part of any State and yet are the territories of the Union. That the
States and the Union Territories are different entities, is evident from
clause (2) of Article 1 - indeed from the entire scheme of the
Constitution. Article 245(1) says that while Parliament may make laws
for the whole or any part of the territory of India, the legislature of a
State may make laws for the whole or any part of the State. Article 1(2)
read with Article 245(1) shows that so far as the Union Territories are
concerned, the only law-making body is Parliament. The legislature of a
State cannot make any law for a Union Territory; it can make laws only
for that State. Clauses (1), (2) and (3) of Article 246 speak of division
of legislative powers between Parliament and State legislatures. This
division is only between Parliament and the State legislatures, i.e.,
between the Union and the States. There is no division of legislative
powers between the Union and Union Territories. Similarly, there is no
division of powers between States and Union Territories. So far as the
Union Territories are concerned, it is clause (4) of Article 246 that is
relevant. It says that Parliament has the power to make laws with
respect to any matter for any part of the territory of India not included
in a State notwithstanding that such matter is a matter enumerated in
the State List. Now, the Union Territory is not included in the territory
of any State. If so, Parliament is the only law-making body available for
such Union Territories. It is equally relevant to mention that the
Constitution, as originally enacted, did not provide for a legislature for
any of the Part 'C' States (or, for that matter, Part 'D' States). It is only
by virtue of the Government of Part 'C' States Act, 1951 that some Part
'C' States including Delhi got a legislature. This was put an end to by
the States Reorganisation Act, 1956. In 1962, the Constitution
Fourteenth (Amendment) Act did provide for creation/constitution of
legislatures for Union Territories (excluding, of course, Delhi) but even
here the Constitution did not itself provide for legislatures for those Part
'C' States; it merely empowered Parliament to provide for the same by
making a law. In the year 1991, the Constitution did provide for a
legislature for the Union Territory of Delhi [National Capital Territory of
Delhi] by the Sixty-Ninth (Amendment) Act (Article 239-AA) but even
here the legislature so created was not a full-fledged legislature nor did
it have the effect of - assuming that it could - lift the National Capital
Territory of Delhi from Union Territory category to the category of States
within the meaning of Chapter I of Part XI of the Constitution. All this
necessarily means that so far as the Union Territories are concerned,
there is no such thing as List I, List II or List III. The only legislative
body is Parliament - or a legislative body created by it. Parliament can
make any law in respect of the said territories - subject, of course, to
constitutional limitations other than those specified in Chapter I of Part
XI of the Constitution. Above all, the Union Territories are not "States"
as contemplated by Chapter I of Part XI; they are the territories of the
Union falling outside the territories of the States. Once the Union
Territory is a part of the Union and not part of any State, it follows that
any tax levied by its legislative body is Union taxation. Admittedly, it
cannot be called "State taxation" - and under the constitutional
scheme, there is no third kind of taxation. Either it is Union taxation or
State taxation. This is also the opinion of the majority in Sea Customs
Act, Re1. B.P. Sinha, C.J., speaking on behalf of himself, P.B.
Gajendragadkar, Wanchoo and Shah, JJ. - while dealing with the
argument that in the absence of a power in Parliament to levy taxes on
lands and buildings (which power exclusively belongs to State
Legislatures, i.e., Item 49 in List II), the immunity provided by Article
289(1) does not make any sense - observed thus : (SCR p. 812)
"It is true that List I contains no tax directly on property like List
II, but it does not follow from that that the Union has no power to
impose a tax directly on property under any circumstances. Article
246(4) gives power to Parliament to make laws with respect to any
matter for any part of the territory of India not included in a State
notwithstanding that such matter is a matter enumerated in the
State List. This means that so far as Union Territories are concerned
Parliament has power to legislate not only with respect to items in
List I but also with respect to items in List II. Therefore, so far as the
Union Territories are concerned, Parliament has power to impose a
tax directly on property as such. It cannot therefore be said that the
exemption of States' property from Union taxation directly on
property under Article 289(1) would be meaningless as Parliament
has no power to impose any tax directly on property. If a State has
any property in any Union Territory that property would be exempt
from Union taxation on property under Article 289(1). The argument
therefore that Article 289(1) cannot be confined to tax directly
on property because there is no such tax provided in List I cannot be
accepted."
153. Rajagopala Ayyangar, J. agreed with Sinha, C.J. on this aspect,
as indeed on the main holding. The decision in Sea Customs Act, Re1
has been rendered by a Bench of nine learned Judges. The decision of
the majority is binding upon us and we see no reason to take a
different view. Indeed, the view taken by the majority accords fully
with the view expressed by us hereinabove.
154. Now, so far as the analogy of laws made by Parliament under
Articles 249, 250, 252 and 357 are concerned, we think the analogy is
odious. Articles 249, 250 and 357 are exceptional situations which call
for Parliament to step in and make laws in respect of matters
enumerated in List II and which laws have effect for a limited period.
Article 252 is a case where the State Legislatures themselves invite
Parliament to make a law on their behalf. These are all situations of
what may be called "substitute legislation" - either because of a
particular situation or because there is no legislature at a given
moment to enact laws. As against these provisions, clause (4) of Article
246 is a permanent feature and laws made thereunder are laws made
in the regular course.
155. In this connection, it is necessary to remember that all the
Union Territories are not situated alike. There are certain Union
Territories (i.e., Andaman and Nicobar Islands and Chandigarh) for
which there can be no legislature at all - as on today. There is a
second category of Union Territories covered by Article 239-A (which
applied to Himachal Pradesh, Manipur, Tripura, Goa, Daman and Diu
and Pondicherry - now, of course, only Pondicherry survives in this
category, the rest having acquired Statehood) which have legislatures
by courtesy of Parliament. Parliament can, by law, provide for
constitution of legislatures for these States and confer upon these
legislatures such powers, as it may think appropriate. Parliament had
created legislatures for these Union Territories under the "the
Government of Union Territories Act, 1963", empowering them to make
laws with respect to matters in List II and List III, but subject to its
overriding power. The third category is Delhi. It had no legislature with
effect from 1-11-1956 until one has been created under and by virtue
of the Constitution Sixty-Ninth (Amendment) Act, 1991 which
introduced Article 239-AA. We have already dealt with the special
features of Article 239-AA and need not repeat it. Indeed, a reference
to Article 239-B read with clause (8) of Article 239-AA shows how the
Union Territory of Delhi is in a class by itself but is certainly not a State
within the meaning of Article 246 or Part VI of the Constitution. In
sum, it is also a territory governed by clause (4) of Article 246. As
pointed out by the learned Attorney General, various Union Territories
are in different stages of evolution. Some have already acquired
Statehood and some may be on the way to it. The fact, however,
remains that those surviving as Union Territories are governed by
Article
246(4) notwithstanding the differences in their respective set-ups -
and Delhi, now called the "National Capital Territory of Delhi", is yet a
Union Territory.
156. It would be appropriate at this stage to refer to a few decisions
on this aspect. In T.M. a Constitution Bench speaking
through Bachawat, J. had this to say : (SCR p. 108-11)
"Parliament has plenary power to legislate for the Union Territories
with regard to any subject. With regard to Union Territories there is
no distribution of legislative power. Article 246(4) enacts that
'Parliament has power to make laws with respect to any matter for
any part of the territory of India not included in a State
notwithstanding that such matter is a matter enumerated in the
State
List.' In R.K. Sen V. Union it was pointed out that having
regard to Article 367, the definition of 'State' in Section 3(58) of the
General Clauses Act, 1897 applies for the interpretation of the
Constitution unless there is anything repugnant in the subject or
context. Under that definition, the expression 'State' as respects any
period after the commencement of the Constitution (Seventh
Amendment) Act, 1956 'shall mean a State specified in the First
Schedule to the Constitution and shall include a Union Territory'. But
this inclusive definition is repugnant to the subject and context of
Article 246. There, the expression 'State' means the States specified
in the First Schedule. There is a distribution of legislative power
between Parliament and the legislatures of the States. Exclusive
power to legislate with respect to the matters enumerated in the
State List is assigned to the legislatures of the States established by
Part VI. There is no distribution of legislative power with respect to
Union Territories. That is why Parliament is given power by Article
246(4) to legislate even with respect to matters enumerated in the
State List. If the inclusive definition of 'State' in Section 3(58) of the
General Clauses Act were to apply to Article 246(4), Parliament
would have no power to legislate for the Union Territories with
respect to matters enumerated in the State List and until a
legislature empowered to legislate on those matters is created under
Article 239-A for the Union Territories, there would be no legislature
competent to legislate on those matters; moreover, for certain
territories such as the Andaman and Nicobar Islands no legislature
can be created under Article 239-A, and for such territories there can
be no authority competent to legislate with respect to matters
enumerated in the State List. Such a construction is repugnant to
the subject and context of Article 246. It follows that in view of
Article 246(4), Parliament has plenary powers to make laws for
Union Territories on all matters. Parliament can by law extend the
Income Tax Act, 1961 to a Union Territory with such modifications as
it thinks fit. The President in the exercise of his powers under Article
240 can make regulations which
have the same force and effect as an Act of Parliament which applies to
that territory. The President can therefore by regulation made under
Article 240 extend the Income Tax Act, 1961 to that territory with such
modifications as he thinks fit.
The President can thus make regulations under Article 240 with
respect to a Union Territory occupying the same field on which
Parliament can also make laws. We are not impressed by the
argument that such overlapping of powers would lead to a clash
between the President and Parliament. The Union Territories are
Centrally administered through the President acting through an
administrator. In the cabinet system of Government the President
acts on the advice of the Ministers who are responsible to Parliament.
*
*
*
It is not necessary to make any distribution of income tax with respect to Union
Territories as those territories are Centrally administered through the President."
(emphasis added)
We respectfully agree with the above statement of law.
157. We do not think it necessary to refer to or discuss the
propositions laid down in Advance Insurance Co. Ltd. V. Gurudasmal2
holding that the amended definition of "State" in clause (58) of Section
3 of the General Clauses Act applies to interpretation of Constitution by
virtue of Article 372-A nor with the contrary proposition in the
dissenting judgment of Bhargava, J. in Shiv Kirpal Singh V. V.V. Giri10
246 - indeed of Chapter I in Part XI - excludes the application of the
said amended definition.
158. In Mithan Lal2 , T.L. Venkatarama Iyer, J., speaking for the
Constitution Bench, while dealing with an argument based on Article
248(2) observed : (SCR p. 452)
"That article has reference to the distribution of legislative powers
between the Centre and the States mentioned in Parts A and B
under the three Lists in Schedule VII, and it provides that in respect
of matters not enumerated in the Lists including taxation it is
Parliament that has power to enact laws. It has no application to Part
C States, for which the governing provision is Article 246(4).
Moreover, when a notification is issued by the appropriate
Government extending the law of a Part A State to a Part C State,
the law so extended derives its force in the State to which it is
extended from Section 2 of the Part C States (Laws) Act enacted by
Parliament. The result of a notification issued under that section is
that the provisions of the law which is extended become
incorporated by reference, in the Act itself, and therefore a tax
imposed
thereunder is a tax imposed by Parliament. There is thus no substance
in this contention."
(emphasis added)
159. To the same effect is the decision of a Division Bench in Sat Pal
& Co. V. Lt. Governor of Delhi23
160. It is then argued for the appellants that if the above view is
taken, it would lead to an inconsistency. The reasoning in this behalf
runs thus : a law made by the legislature of a Union Territory levying
taxes on lands and buildings would be "State taxation", but if the same
tax is levied by a law made by Parliament, it is being characterised as
"Union taxation"; this is indeed a curious and inconsistent position, say
the learned counsel for the appellants. In our opinion, however, the
very premise upon which this argument is urged is incorrect. A tax
levied under a law made by a legislature of a Union Territory cannot be
called "State taxation" for the simple reason that Union Territory is not
a "State" within the meaning of Article 246 (or for that matter, Chapter
I of Part XI) or Part VI or Articles 285 to 289.
161. Lastly, we may refer to the circumstance that the Delhi
Municipal Corporation Act, 1957 was enacted by Parliament. Hence, so
far as the Delhi Municipal Corporation area is concerned, the taxes are
levied under and by virtue of a parliamentary enactment. So far as the
New Delhi Municipal Council area is concerned, the taxes were levied till
1994 under the Punjab Municipal Act, 1911 as extended and applied by
the Part 'C' States (Laws) Act, 1950 enacted by Parliament. It is held
by this Court in Mithan Lal22 that extension of an Act to an area has the
same effect as if that Act has been made by the extending legislature
for the area. The Court said : (SCR p. 452)
"Moreover, when a notification is issued by the appropriate
Government extending the law of a Part A State to a Part C State,
the law so extended derives its force in the State to which it is
The surest way't to legal research!"
extended from Section 2 of the Part C States (Laws) Act enacted by
Parliament. The result of a notification issued under that section is
that the provisions of the law which is extended become
incorporated by reference in the Act itself, and therefore a tax
imposed thereunder is a tax imposed by Parliament. There is thus no
substance in this contention."
[Also see T.M. Kanniyan 8 (SCR at p. 108).]
162. It must accordingly be held that with effect from 1950, it is as
if the property taxes are levied by a parliamentary enactment. In 1994,
of course, Parliament itself enacted the New Delhi Municipal Council Act
(with effect from 25-5-1994) repealing the Punjab Municipal Act. Taxes
levied under these enactments cannot but be Union taxation - Union
taxation in a Union Territory.
1 For all the above reasons, we hold that the levy of taxes on
property by the Punjab Municipal Act, 1911 [as extended to Part 'C'
State of Delhi by Part 'C' States (Laws) Act, 1950], the Delhi Municipal
Corporation Act, 1957 and the New Delhi Municipal Council Act, 1994
(both parliamentary enactments) constitutes "Union taxation" within
the meaning of Article 289(1).
PART IV
164. The Delhi Municipal Corporation Act, 1957, the Punjab
Municipal Act, 1911 (as extended to the Union Territory of Delhi) and
the New Delhi Municipal Council Act, 1994 (NDMC Act) specifically
exempt the properties of the Union from taxation. Section 119 of the
Delhi Municipal Corporation Act is in terms of Article 285 of the
Constitution. It reads:
"119. Taxation of Union properties. - (1) Notwithstanding anything
contained in the foregoing provisions of this Chapter, lands and
buildings being properties of the Union shall be exempt from the
property taxes specified in Section 114:
Provided that nothing in this sub-section shall prevent the
Corporation from levying any of the said taxes on such lands and
buildings to which immediately before the 26th January, 1950, they
were liable or treated as liable, so long as that tax continues to be
levied by the Corporation on other lands and buildings."
165. Sub-section (3) of Section 61 is also in terms of Article 285 of
the Constitution. It reads:
"Nothing in this sub-section shall authorise the imposition of any
tax which the provincial legislature has no power to impose in the
Province under the Constitution-
Provided that a committee which immediately before the
commencement of the Constitution shall lawfully levying any such
tax under this section as then in force may continue to levy such tax
until provision to the contrary is made by Parliament."
Sub-section (1) of Section 65 of the NDMC Act is again in the same
terms as Article 285.
166. None of the above enactments provide any exemption in favour
of the properties of a State. Section 115(4) of the Delhi Municipal
Corporation Act, Section 61 of the Punjab Municipal Act and Section 62
of the NDMC Act levy property tax on all the properties within their
jurisdiction. From the fact that properties of the Union have been
specifically exempted in terms of Article 285 but the properties of the
States have not been exempted in terms of Article 289 shows that so
far as these enactments go, they purport to levy tax on the properties
of the States as well. The State Governments, it is equally obvious, are
not claiming exemption from municipal taxation under any provision of
the State enactment concerned, but only under and by virtue of Article
289 of the Constitution. They are relying upon clause (1) of Article 289
which is undoubtedly in absolute terms. Clause (1) of Article
289 says, "the property and income of a State shall be exempt from
Union taxation". But clause (1) does not stand alone. It is qualified by
clause (2) - which in turn is qualified by clause (3). Where an
exemption is claimed under clause (1), we cannot shut our eyes to the
said qualifying clause and give effect to clause (1) alone. In the
decision in A.P. SRTC², this Court has held that clause (2) is an
exception to clause (1) and that clause (3) is an exception to clause
(2). When a claim for exemption is made under clause (1) of Article
289, the Court has to examine and determine the field occupied by
clause (1) by reading clauses (1) and (2) together. If there is a law
made by Parliament within the meaning of clause (2), the area covered
by that law will be removed from the field occupied by clause (1). By
way of analogy, we may refer to sub-clause (f) of clause (1) and clause
(5) of Article 19, which has been explained by a Special Bench of
eleven Judges in R.C. Cooper V. Union of India¹5 in the following
"Clause (5) of Article 19 and clauses (1) and (2) of Article 31
prescribe restrictions upon State action, subject to which the right to
property may be exercised."
But before we elaborate this aspect, it would be appropriate to examine
the meaning and scheme of Article 289 and the object underlying it.
167. Since Article 289 is successor to Section 155 of the
Government of India Act, 1935 - no doubt, with certain changes - it
would be helpful to refer to and examine the purport and scope of
Section 155 (as it obtained prior to its amendment in 1947). We would
also be simultaneously examining the scheme and purport of Article
289. It would be appropriate to read both Article 289 and Section 155
together:
"289. Exemption of property

(2) Nothing in this Act

168. The first distinguishing feature to be noticed is that while
Section 155 spoke of "lands and buildings" belonging to the
Government of a Province situate in British India being exempt from
Federal taxation (we are leaving out the portion relating to Rulers of
Acceding States/Federating States), Article 289(1) speaks of "the
property" of a State being exempt from Union taxation. The second
material difference is between proviso (a) to Section 155(1) and clause
(2) of Article 289 corresponding to it. Under the proviso, trade or
business carried on by a Provincial Government was excluded from the
exemption provided in the main limb of sub-section (1) whereas clause
(2) does not itself deny the exemption to such trade or business; it
merely enables Parliament to make a law levying tax on such trade or
business. This change has a certain background, which we shall refer to
later. The third distinguishing feature between the said proviso and
clause (2) is this : while the denial of exemption provided by the
proviso was to the trade or business carried on by a Provincial
Government outside its territory, clause (2) of Article 289 contains no
such restrictive words. The fourth distinguishing feature is the provision
in clause (3) of Article 289, which enables Parliament to declare which
trades/businesses are incidental to ordinary functions of Government,
in which event those trades/businesses go out of the purview of clause
(2); no such provision existed in Section 155.
169. Even under the Government of India Act, 1935 the power to
levy taxes on lands and buildings was vested in the Provincial
Legislatures alone. Federal Legislature had no power to levy such taxes.
If so, the question arises - why did the British Parliament provide that
the lands and buildings of a Provincial Government situated in British
India are exempt from Federal taxation. Since, no Federal tax could
ever have been levied by the
Federal Legislature on lands or buildings, is the exemption
meaningless? This is the question which was also agitated before the
learned Judges who answered the Presidential reference in Sea
Customs Act, Re1. Shri P.P. Rao and other learned counsel appearing for
the State Governments submit that the said exemption is neither
meaningless nor unnecessary. They submit that the language used in
the main limb of sub-section (1) of Section 155 was used advisedly to
meet a specific situation. Their explanation, as condensed by us in our
words, is to the following effect:
"Even at the time of enactment and commencement of the
Government of India Act, 1935, the area now comprised in the Union
Territory of Delhi was comprised in the Chief Commissioner's
Province of Delhi; besides Delhi, there were several other Chief
Commissioner's Provinces within British India; every Provincial
Government and almost every major native State had properties in
Delhi for one or the other purpose; prior to the commencement of
the 1935 Act, there was no such thing as division of powers between
the Centre and the Provinces; Provinces were mere administrative
units; the concept of division of powers between the Federation
(Centre) and its units (Provinces), i.e., the concept of a Federation,
broadly speaking, was introduced by the said Act for the first time;
in such a situation, it was necessary that the mutual respect and
regard between the Centre and the Provinces basic to a federal
concept, is affirmed and given due constitutional recognition; even
before the enactment of the Delhi Laws Act, 1912, the Governor
General-in-Council with the sanction and approbation of the
Secretary of State for India, had, by proclamation published in
Notification No. 911 dated the 17th day of September, 1912, taken
under his immediate authority and management, the territories
mentioned in Schedule A to the Act (that portion of the district of
Delhi comprising the Tehsil of Delhi and police station of Mehrauli)
which were formerly included in the Province of Punjab, with a view
to provide for the administration thereof by a Chief Commissioner as
a separate Province to be known as the Province of Delhi; it was the
said status which was affirmed by the Delhi Laws Act, 1912; Section
5 of the Government of India Act, 1935 made a clear distinction
between the Provinces and the Chief Commissioner's Provinces;
while the Provinces were provided with legislatures (Chapter III of
Part III of the Act), the Chief Commissioner's Provinces, governed by
Part IV of the Act, had no legislatures of their own; the only
legislature for them was the Federal legislature; any tax levied in the
Chief Commissioner's Province could have been levied only by the
Federal legislature or the Governor General, as the case may be;
Section 99(1) of the Act provided that "the Federal Legislature may
make laws for the whole or any part of British India or for any
Federated State and a Provincial Legislature may make
laws for the Province or for any part thereof"; all this shows that the tax
on lands or buildings in the Chief Commissioner's Provinces including
Delhi could have been levied only by Federal legislature; Section 155
(1) was meant to exempt the lands or buildings of Provincial
Governments from such Federal taxation - it is submitted."
170. We find the above explanation cogent and acceptable. It fully
explains the use of the words "lands and buildings" in Section 155(1) of
the Act. We think it unnecessary to repeat the whole reasoning once
again.
171. As against the words "lands and buildings" belonging to a
Provincial Government in Section 155 of the Government of India Act,
1935, Article 289(1) uses a single expression "property" and says that
property of a State shall be exempt from Union taxation. The expression
"property" is indubitably much wider. It takes in not only lands and
buildings but all forms of property. While the Constituent Assembly
Debates do not throw any light upon the reason for this change - from
"lands or buildings" to "property" - it is, in all probability, attributable
to the large number of representations made by several Provincial
Governments to the Constituent Assembly that not merely the lands or
buildings but any and every trade and business carried on by a State
Government should equally be entitled to exemption. Shri B. Sen
invited our attention to those representations and submitted that it is
these representations which induced the Constituent Assembly to draft
clause (2) of Article 289 in a manner different from proviso (a) to
Section 155(1). Be that as it may, the fact remains that the expression
"property" in Article 289(1) has to be given its natural and proper
meaning. It includes not only lands and buildings but all forms of
property. The explanation offered by the learned counsel appearing for
the States, set out in extenso hereinabove, for the use of the words
"lands and buildings" in Section 155(1) is equally valid for clause (1) of
Article 289 insofar as it pertains to lands and buildings.
172. It must be remembered that both Section 155(1) and Article
289(1) exempt the income as well derived by a Provincial
Government/State Government from Union taxation. Both the property
and income of the States are thus exempt under clause (1) of Article
289 subject, of course, to clause (2) thereof.
173. Now what does clause (2) of Article 289 say? It may be noticed
that the language of the first proviso to Section 155 and of clause (2) of
Article 289 is practically identical (except for the two distinguishing
features mentioned hereinbefore). It would, therefore, suffice if we
discuss the proviso. It says - omitting reference to Princely States -
that where a trade or business of any kind is carried on by or on behalf
of the Government of a Province in any part of British India (outside
that Province), nothing in sub-section (1) shall exempt that
Government from any Federal taxation in respect of that trade or
business or any operations connected therewith or any income arising
in connection therewith or any property (i.e. lands and buildings)
occupied for the purposes thereof. It is necessary to emphasise
that the proviso to Section 155(1) which by its own force levied taxes
upon the trading and business operations carried on by the Provincial
Governments did not either define the said expressions or specify which
trading or business operations are subject to taxation. On this account,
the proviso was not and could not be said to have been, ineffective or
unenforceable. It was effective till 26-1-1950. Clause (2) of Article 289
also similarly does not define or specify - nor does it require that the
law made thereunder should so define or specify. It cannot be said that
unless the law made under and with reference to clause (2) specifies
the particular trading or business operations to be taxed, it would not
be a law within the meaning of clause (2). Coming back to the
language of clause (2), a question is raised, why does the proviso speak
of taxation in respect of trade or business when the main limb of sub-
section (1) speaks only of taxes in respect of lands or buildings and
income? Is the ambit of proviso wider than the main limb? Is it an
independent provision of a substantive nature notwithstanding the label
given to it as a proviso? Or is it only an exception? It is asked. We are,
however, of the considered opinion that it is more important to give
effect to the language of and the intention underlying the proviso than
to find a label for it. It is clarificatory in nature without a doubt; it
appears to be more indeed. It is concerned mainly with the
"income" (of Provincial Governments) referred to in the main limb of
sub-section (1). It speaks of tax on the "lands or buildings" in that
context alone, as we shall explain in the next paragraph. The idea
underlying the proviso is to make it clear that the exemption of income
of Provincial Government operates only where the income is earned or
received by it as a Government; it will not avail where the income is
earned or received by the Provincial Government on account of or from
any trade or business carried on by it - that is a trade or a business
carried on with profit motive. In the light of the language of the proviso
to Section 155 and clause (2) of Article 289, it is not possible to say
that every activity carried on by the Government is governmental
activity. A distinction has to be made between governmental activity
and trade and business carried on by the Government, at least for the
purposes of this clause. It is for this reason, we say, that unless an
activity in the nature of trade and business is carried on with a profit
motive, it would not be a trade or business contemplated by clause (2).
For example, mere sale of government properties, immovable or
moveable, or granting of leases and licences in respect of its properties
does not amount to carrying on trade or business. Only where a trade
or business is carried on with a profit motive - or any property is used
or occupied for the purpose of carrying on such trade or business -
that the proviso [or for that matter clause (2) of Article 289] would be
attracted. Where there is no profit motive involved in any activity
carried on by the State Government, it cannot be said to be carrying on
a trade or business within the meaning of the proviso/clause (2),
merely
because some profit results from the activity- We may pause here a
while and explain why we are attaching such restricted meaning to the
words "trade or business" in the proviso to Section 155 and in clause
(2) of Article 289. Both the words import substantially the same idea
though, ordinarily speaking, the expression "business" appears to be
wider in its content. The expression, however, has no definite meaning;
its meaning varies with the context and several other factors. See
Board of Revenue V. A.M. Ansari24 and State of Gujarat V. Raipur
Manufacturing Co. Ltd. 25 As observed by Lord Diplock in Town
Investments Ltd. V. Deptt. of Environment "the word 'business' is an
etymological chameleon; it suits its meaning to the context in which it
is found. It is not a term of legal art and its dictionary meanings as
Lindley LJ pointed out in Rolls V. Miller27 embrace 'almost anything
which is an occupation, as distinguished from a pleasure - anything
which is an occupation or a duty which requires attention is a business
Having regard to the context in which the words "trade or
business" occur - whether in the proviso to Section 155 of the
Government of India Act, 1935 or in clause (2) of Article 289 of our
Constitution - they must be given, and we have given, a restricted
meaning, the context being levy of tax by one unit of Federation upon
the income of the other unit, the manifold activities carried on by
Governments under our constitutional scheme, the necessity to
maintain a balance between the Centre and the States and so on.
174. Proviso (i) not only speaks of trade or business carried on by
the Provincial Governments (outside their respective territories) but
also "any operations connected therewith or any income arising in
connection therewith or any property occupied for the purposes
thereof". So far as operations connected with the trade or business is
concerned, they naturally go along with the main trade or business. No
difficulty is expressed by anyone on this count. Similarly, with respect
to any income arising in connection with such trade or business too, no
difficulty is expressed since the income is an incident of the trade or
business. Difficulty is, however, expressed regarding the other set of
words "or any property occupied for the purposes thereof". The said
words, in our opinion, mean that if any property, i.e., any land or
building is occupied by the Provincial Government for the purpose of
any trade or business carried on by the Provincial Government, such
land or building too loses the benefit of exemption contained in the
main limb of sub-section (1); it becomes liable to Federal taxation. To
repeat, the central idea underlying the proviso is to remove the trading
or business operations from the purview of the main limb of sub-section
(1) of Section 155. Now, coming to clause (2) of Article 289, position is
the same with the two distinguishing features mentioned supra, viz.,
(a) under this clause, removal of exemption is not automatic; it comes
about only when Parliament makes a law imposing taxes in respect of
any trade or business carried on by a State Government and all
activities connected therewith or any property used or occupied for the
purposes of such business as also the income derived therefrom. If any
property - whether moveable or immovable - is used or occupied for
the purpose of any such trade or business, it can be denied the
exemption provided by clause (1) but this denial can be only by way of
a law made by Parliament and (b) the exception contemplated by
clause (2) is not confined to trade and business carried on by a State
outside its territory as was provided by the first proviso to Section 155.
Even the trade or business carried on by a State within its own territory
can also be brought within the purview of the enactment made (by
Parliament) in terms of the said clause.
175. Adverting to the matter before us, the question is whether
Parliament has made any law as contemplated by clause (2) of Article
289? For, if no such law is made, it is evident, all the properties of
State Governments in the Union Territory of Delhi would be exempt
from taxation. [Parliament has admittedly not made any law as
contemplated by clause (3) of Article 289.] We have observed
hereinbefore that the claim of exemption put forward by State
Governments in respect of their properties situated in NDMC and Delhi
Municipal Corporation areas is founded - and can only be founded -
on Article 289. The States invoke clause (1) of the article but we are of
the considered opinion that clause (1) cannot be looked at in isolation;
it must be read subject to clause (2). All the three clauses of Article
289 are parts of one single scheme. Hence, when a claim for exemption
with reference to clause (1) is made, one must see what is the field on
which it operates and that can be determined only by reading it along
with clause (2). The exemption provided by Article 289(1) is a qualified
one - qualified by clause (2), as explained hereinbefore. It is not an
absolute exemption like the one provided by Article 285(1). If there is a
law within the meaning of clause (2), the field occupied by clause (1)
gets curtailed to the extent specified in clause (2) and the law made
thereunder. It is, therefore, necessary in this case to determine
whether the Punjab Municipal Act, the Delhi Municipal Corporation Act
and the NDMC Act are or can be deemed to be enactments within the
meaning of clause (2) of Article 289. These enactments - and certainly
the Delhi Municipal Corporation Act and the NDMC Act - are post-
constitutional enactments. As stated hereinbefore, these enactments
while specifically exempting the Union properties in terms of Article
285, do not exempt the properties of the
States in terms of Article
The omission cannot be said to be
unintentional - particularly in the case of the Delhi Municipal
Corporation Act and the NDMC Act. The intention is clear and obvious :
the enactments do not wish to provide for any exemption in favour of
properties of the States situated within their respective jurisdictions.
Taxes are levied on all properties within their jurisdiction (except the
properties specifically exempted), irrespective of who owns them and to
what use they are put. In such a situation, the question is, how should
they be understood? Two views can be taken : one that since the said
enactments do not expressly purport to have been made under and as
contemplated by clause (2) of Article 289, they should not be read and
understood as laws contemplated by or within the meaning of the said
clause (2). The effect of this view would be that the properties of the
State in the Union Territory of Delhi will be totally exempt irrespective
of the manner of their use and occupation. In other words, the
consequence would be that the relevant provisions of the said
enactments would be ineffective and unenforceable against all the
properties held by the States in the Union Territory/National Capital
Territory of Delhi, irrespective of the nature of their user or occupation.
The second view is that since there is always a presumption of
constitutionality in favour of the statutes and also because the
declaration of invalidity or inapplicability of a statute should be only to
the extent the enactment is clearly outside the legislative competence
of the legislative body making it or is squarely covered by the ban or
prohibition in question, the declaration of invalidity should not extend
to the extent the enactments can be related to and upheld with
reference to some
constitutional provision, even though not cited by or recited in the
enactment. Similarly, the declaration of inapplicability should only be to
the extent the law is plainly covered by the ban or prohibition, as the
case may be. What is not covered by the constitutional bar should be
held to be applicable and effective. In our respectful opinion, the latter
view is consistent with the well-known principles of constitutional
interpretation and should be preferred. We may pause here and explain
our viewpoint. If the law had expressly stated that it is a law made
under and with reference to clause (2) of Article 289, no further
question would have arisen. The only question is where it does not say
so
, can its validity or applicability be sustained with reference to
clause (2). In our considered opinion, it should be so sustained, even
though it may be that the appellant-corporations have not chosen to
argue this point specifically. As would be evident from some of the
decisions referred to hereinafter, the fact that a party or a Government
does not choose to put forward an argument cannot be a ground for the
court not to declare the correct position in law. The appellants are
saying that all the properties of the States are not exempt because the
taxes levied by them do not constitute "Union taxation" within the
meaning of clause (1) of Article 289. We have not agreed with them.
We have held that the taxes levied by the aforesaid enactments do
constitute "Union taxation" within the meaning of clause (1) of Article
289 and that by virtue of the exemption provided by clause (1), taxes
are not leviable on State properties. In view of the fact that clauses (1)
and (2) of Article 289 go together, form part of one scheme and have to
be read together, we cannot ignore the operation and applicability of
clause (2), at the same time. Reference to a few decisions would bear
out our view. In Chiranjit Lal Chowdhuri V. Union of India² Fazl Ali, J.
stated : (SCR p. 879)
"
it is the accepted doctrine of the American courts, which I
consider to be well-founded on principles, that the presumption is
always in favour of the constitutionality of an enactment, and the
burden is upon him who attacks it to show that there has been a
clear transgression of the constitutional principles".
In Burrakur Coal Co. Ltd. V. Union of India²9 (AIR at p. 963),
Mudholkar, J., speaking for the Constitution Bench, observed:
"Where the validity of a law made by a competent legislature
is
challenged in a Court of law that Court is bound to presume in favour
of its validity. Further, while considering the validity of the law the
court will not consider itself restricted to the pleadings of the State
and would
be free to satisfy itself whether under any provision of the Constitution
the law can be sustained."
In Rt. Rev. Msgr. Mark Netto V. State of Kerala³0 the Constitution Bench
considered the question whether a rule made by the Government of
Kerala is violative of the right conferred upon the minorities by Article
"In that view of the matter the Rule in question its wide
amplitude sanctioning the withholding of permission for admission of
girl students in the boys' minority school is violative of Article 30. If
so widely interpreted it crosses the barrier of regulatory measures
and comes in the region of interference with the administration of
the institution, a right which is guaranteed to the minority under
Article 30. The Rule, therefore, must be interpreted narrowly and is
held to be inapplicable to a minority educational institution in a
situation of the kind with which we are concerned in this case. We do
not think it necessary or advisable to strike down the Rule as a whole
but do restrict its operation and make it inapplicable to a minority
educational institution in a situation like the one which arose in this
case."
(emphasis supplied)
176. Reference may also be made to another Constitution Bench
decision in Sanjeev Coke Manufacturing Co. V. Bharat Coking Coal
31
25)
"The deponents of the affidavits filed into court may speak for the
parties on whose behalf they swear to the statements. They do not
speak for Parliament. No one may speak for Parliament and
Parliament is never before the court. After Parliament has said what
it intends to say, only the court may say what Parliament meant to
say. None else. Once a statute leaves Parliament House, the Court is
the only authentic voice which may echo (interpret) Parliament. This
the Court will do with reference to the language of the statute and
other permissible aids. The executive Government may place before
the Court their understanding of what Parliament has said or
intended to say or what they think was Parliament's object and all
the facts and circumstances which in their view led to the legislation.
When they do so, they do not speak for Parliament. No Act of
Parliament may be struck down because of the understanding or
misunderstanding of parliamentary intention by the executive
Government or because their (the Government's) spokesmen do not
bring out relevant circumstances but indulge in empty and self-
defeating affidavits. They do not and they cannot bind Parliament.
Validity of legislation is not to be judged merely by affidavits filed on
behalf of the State, but by all the relevant circumstances which the
court may ultimately find and more especially by what may be
gathered from what the legislature has itself said."
177. Lastly, we may quote the pertinent propositions enunciated in
Ram Krishna Dalmia V. Justice S.R. Tendolkar32 to the following effect
:
(SCR p. 297)
"(b) that there is always a presumption in favour of the
constitutionality of an enactment and the burden is upon him who
attacks it to show that there has been a clear transgression of the
constitutional principles;
*
*
*
(e) that in order to sustain the presumption of constitutionality
the court may take into consideration matters of common
knowledge, matters of common report, the history of the times and
may assume every state of facts which can be conceived existing at
the time of legislation; and
"
These are well-settled propositions. Applying them, it must be held that
the aforesaid municipal laws are inapplicable to the properties of State
Governments to the extent such properties are governed and saved by
clause (1) of Article 289 and that insofar as the properties used or
occupied for the purpose of a trade or business carried on by the State
Government (as explained hereinbefore) are concerned, the ban in
clause (1) does not avail them and the taxes thereon must be held to
be valid and effective. It may be reiterated that the Delhi Municipal
Corporation Act, 1957 and the NDMC Act, 1994 are post-constitutional
enactments and that the Punjab Municipal Act too must be deemed to
be a post-constitutional enactment for the reasons given hereinabove.
It must, therefore, be held that the levy of property taxes by the said
enactments is valid to the extent it relates to lands and buildings
owned by State Governments and used or occupied for the purposes of
any trade or business carried on by such State Government. In other
words, the levy must be held to be invalid and inapplicable only to the
extent of those lands and buildings which are not used or occupied for
the purposes of any trade or business carried on by the State
Government, as explained hereinbefore. It is for the appropriate
assessing authorities to determine which land/building falls within
which category in accordance with law and in the light of this judgment
and take appropriate further action. In this connection, we may
mention that the assessing authorities under the Act have to decide
several questions under the Act including the questions whether any
land or building is being used for "charitable purpose" or "public
worship". They also have to decide whether a land is an "agricultural
land". These are difficult questions as would be evident from a
reference to the plethora of decisions under the Income Tax Act where
these expressions occur. For this reason, neither the exemption can be
held to be ineffective nor the authorities can be said to have no
jurisdiction to decide these questions. Appeals are provided to civil
courts against the orders of the assessing authorities.
178. In the light of the above position of law, it is for the Union of
India to consider whether any steps are to be taken to maintain the
balance between the Union and the States in the matter of taxation.
PART V
179. The following conclusions flow from the above discussion:
(a) the property taxes levied by and under the Punjab Municipal
Act, 1911, the New Delhi Municipal Council Act, 1994 and the Delhi
Municipal Corporation Act, 1957 constitute "Union taxation" within
the meaning of clause (1) of Article 289 of the Constitution of India;
(b) the levy of property taxes under the aforesaid enactments on
lands and/or buildings belonging to the State Governments is invalid
and incompetent by virtue of the mandate contained in clause (1) of
Article 289. However, if any land or building is used or occupied for
the purposes of any trade or business - trade or business
as
explained in the body of this judgment - carried on by or on behalf
of the State Government, such land or building shall be subject to
levy of property taxes levied by the said enactments. In other words,
State property exempted under clause (1) means such property as is
used for the purpose of the Government and not for the purposes of
trade or business;
(c) it is for the authorities under the said enactments to
determine with notice to the affected State Government, which land
or building is used or occupied for the purposes of any trade or
business carried on by or on behalf of that State Government.
180. We direct that this judgment shall operate only prospectively.
It will govern the Financial Year 1996-97 (commencing on 1-4-1996)
and onwards. For this purpose, we invoke our power under Article 142
of the Constitution. The reasons are the following:
(a) according to the judgment under appeal, the properties of the
State were exempt in toto whereas according to this judgment, some
of the properties of the State situated within the Union Territory of
Delhi may become liable to tax. The assessees are the State
Governments and the taxes are being levied under a parliamentary
enactment. This inter-State character of the dispute is a relevant
factor;
(b) from the year 1975 up to now, there have been no
assessments because of the judgment of the High Court; and
(c) retrospective assessment of properties under the above
enactments appears to be a doubtful proposition - at any rate, not
an advisable thing to do in all the facts and circumstances of this
case.
181. Before parting with this case, it would be appropriate to refer to
a submission of Shri B. Sen. He submitted that the exemption provided
by clause (1) of Article 289 does not and cannot apply to compensatory
taxes like water tax, drainage tax and so on. Even where the enactment
does not specifically and individually enumerate these components of
property taxes, i.e., where the levy is of a composite tax known as
"property tax", it must be presumed, says Shri B. Sen, that part of the
propertv taxes are compensatorv in nature. We are. however. not
inclined to express any opinion on this
aspect in the absence of any material placed in support thereof. We
cannot permit this new plea, which does not appear to be a pure
question of law, to be raised for the first time at the time of arguments
in these appeals/writ petitions.
182. The appeals and writ petitions are accordingly disposed of in
the above terms. The judgment of the High Court shall stand modified
to the extent it is contrary to this judgment.
183. There shall be no order as to costs.

It is stated in the opinion by Ahmadi, C.J. in para 25 that though the New Delhi Municipal
Committee (sic) Act, 1994 is the Act prevailing in the areas covered by it, "for the purposes
of deciding the case, we are concerned only with the provisions of the Act" which as stated
in para 2 implies the Punjab Municipal Act, 1911. This opinion therefore did not take the
NDMC Act, 1994 into consideration.

For example, almost every State Government maintains one or more guest houses in Delhi
for accommodating their officials and others connected with the affairs of the State. But,
when some rooms/accommodation are not occupied by such persons and remain vacant,
outsiders are accommodated therein, though at higher rates. This activity cannot obviously
be called carrying on trade or business nor can it be said that the building is used or occupied
for the purpose of any trade or business carried on by the State Government.

As a matter of fact, Section 115(4) of the Delhi Municipal Corporation Act and Section
62(1) of the NDMC Act expressly exempt properties used exclusively for "charitable purposes"
or "for public worship" (as defined by them) but do not provide for an exemption in the case
of the properties of the States in terms of Article 289. It cannot be said, or presumed, that
Parliament was not aware of, or conscious of, Article 289 while enacting the said Acts.
Section 62(1) and (2) of the NDMC Act read:
"62. (1) Save as otherwise provided in this Act, the property tax shall be levied in respect of
all lands and buildings in New Delhi except-
(a) lands and buildings or portions of lands and buildings exclusively occupied and used for
public worship or by a society or body for a charitable purpose:
Provided that such society or body is supported wholly or in part by voluntary contributions,
applies its profits, if any, or other income in promoting its objects and does not pay any
dividend or bonus to its members.
Explanation.-'Charitable purpose" includes relief to the poor, education and medical relief but
does not include a purpose which relates exclusively to religious teaching;
(b) lands and buildings vested in the Council, in respect of which said tax, if levied, would
under the provisions of this Act be leviable primarily on the Council;
(c) agricultural lands and buildings (other than dwelling houses).
Lands and buildings or portions thereof shall not be deemed to be exclusively occupied and
used for public worship or for a charitable purpose within the meaning of clause (a) of sub-
section (1) if any trade or business is carried on in such lands and buildings or portions
thereof or if in respect of such lands and buildings or portions thereof, any rent is derived.
This is the normal situation. No enactment states that it is made under and with
reference to a particular head of legislation in the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution or a
provision in the Constitution. Only when the enactment is questioned on the ground of
legislative competence, is the court required to ascertain the head of legislation or provision
to which the enactment is referable.
