ORDER
1. Mr Tushar Mehta, learned Solicitor General and learned Senior
Counsel viz. Ms Indira Jaising, Mr V. Giri, Mr C.S. Vaidyanathan, Dr
Abhishek Manu Singhvi, will arrange a conference of the advocates
appearing in these matters on 17-1-2020 as per their convenient time
and place. The Secretary General of this Court may also attend the

2. The advocates shall decide the following in the aforesaid meeting:
(1) Whether any of the issues need to be re-framed and/or added
and in what manner?;
(2) The time that will be allotted to each counsel in the case;
(3) The particular points on which each counsel shall address the
Court.
The counsel on both sides will also file their respective compilations
