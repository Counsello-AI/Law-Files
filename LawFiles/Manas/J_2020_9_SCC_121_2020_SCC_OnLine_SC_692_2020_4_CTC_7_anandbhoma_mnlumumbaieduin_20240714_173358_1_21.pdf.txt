A writ petition under Article 32 of the Constitution was filed by the Indian Young
Lawyers Association challenging validity of Rule 3(b) of the Kerala Hindu Places of
Public Worship (Authorisation of Entry) Rules, 1965 and seeking direction to the
respondents therein to permit female devotees between the ages of 10 to 50
years to enter the Sabarimala Temple without any restrictions. A three-Judge Bench
of the Supreme Court referred the matter to a larger Bench for resolution of the
questions. A five-Judge Bench before which the writ petition was placed, allowed
the same by a majority of 4: 1. Several review petitions as well as fresh writ
petitions were filed which were listed and heard together. Majority Judges were of
the opinion that the scope of the freedom of religion guaranteed under Articles 25
and 26 of the Constitution needs an authoritative pronouncement by a larger Bench
of not less than seven Judges. According to the reference, the conflict of opinion
between the judgments in Sri Lakshmindra Thirtha Swamiar of Sri Shirur Matt,
1954 SCR 1005 and Syed Hussain Ali, (1962) 1 SCR 383 pertaining to the role of
the Court in matters which are essential religious practices had to be resolved. The
review petitions were adjourned till the determination of the questions by a larger
Bench. This Bench of nine Judges was constituted by the Chief Justice of India to
answer the reference. At the threshold, upon the objection raised by the parties
taking exception to the reference, an issue as to whether the Court can refer
questions of law to a larger Bench in a review petition was framed.
Their request to hear the issue regarding the maintainability of the reference as a
preliminary question was acceded to.
It was argued on behalf of those objecting to the reference that the review
petitions are not maintainable in view of the limitations in Order XLVII of the
Supreme Court Rules, 2013. As the review petitions are liable to be dismissed, the
reference is bad. Assuming that reference to a larger Bench can be made in a
review petition, it is permissible only after the review is granted and not during the
pendency of a review petition. It was contended that hypothetical questions should
not be answered by the Court. Another submission was that abstract questions of
law without facts cannot be the subject-matter of reference. The reference is
vitiated as no reasons were recorded justifying the prima facie view that there is a
conflict of opinion in the judgments in Sri Lakshmindra Thirtha Swamiar of Sri Shirur
Matt, 1954 SCR 1005 and Syed Hussain Ali, (1962) 1 SCR 383. Another
submission was made that only appeals can be referred to a larger Bench in
accordance with the proviso to Article 145(3) of the Constitution.
After hearing the parties, the present nine-Judge Bench on 10-2-2020 answered
the preliminary point by holding that questions of law can be referred to a larger
Bench in a review petition. Reasons were to follow later. The present order contains
the reasons.
Held :
When a statute is carefully punctuated and there is doubt about its meaning,
weight should undoubtedly be given to the punctuation. However, punctuation may
have its uses in some cases, but it cannot certainly be regarded as a controlling
element and cannot be allowed to control the plain meaning.
(Para 18)
1952 SC 369, affirmed
The surest way t to legal research!"
affirmed on this point
Crawford: Interpretation of Law (Statutory Construction), relied on
Construction of Order XLVII Rule 1 of the Supreme Court Rules should be made
by giving due weight to the punctuation mark "comma" after the words "the Court
may review its judgment or order". The intention of the rule-making authority is
clear that the abovementioned part is disjunctive from the rest of the rule.
Moreover, the words "but no application for review will be entertained in a civil
proceeding except on ground mentioned in Order XLVII Rule 1 of the Code and in a
criminal proceeding except on the ground of an error apparent on the face of
record" are exceptions to the opening words of Order XLVII Rule 1, namely, "the
Court may review its judgment or order". The exceptions carved out in Order XLVII
Rule 1 of the Supreme Court Rules pertain only to civil and criminal proceedings.
Civil proceedings and criminal proceedings dealt with in Part II of the Rules are
different from writ petitions covered by Part III of the Supreme Court Rules. Writ
petitions filed under Article 32 of the Constitution do not fall within the purview of
civil and criminal proceedings. Therefore, the limitations in Order XLVII Rule 1 do not
apply to review petitions filed against judgments or orders passed in writ petitions
filed under Article 32 of the Constitution as in the present case there is no fetter on
the exercise of the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court in
review petitions of judgments or orders arising out of proceedings other than civil
and criminal proceedings.
(Paras 15, 17 and 21)
The alternate submission was that a reference can be made only after the grant
of review and not in a pending review petition cannot be accepted. It is true that
reference in Behram Khurshid Pesikaka, (1955) 1 SCR 613 was made after grant of
review. But that does not mean that reference cannot be made in a pending review
petition. The provision in the Supreme Court Rules, 2013 pertaining to reference to
a larger Bench is Order VI Rule 2. Reference to a larger Bench can be made in any
cause or appeal as well as in any "other proceeding". The term "proceeding" is a
very comprehensive term and generally speaking, means a prescribed course of
action for enforcing a legal right. It is a term giving the widest freedom to a court of
law so that it may do justice to the parties in the case. There cannot be any doubt
that the pending review petition falls within the purview of the expression "other
proceeding". The reference has been made in the course of pending review
petitions.

Behram Khurshid Pesikaka V. State of Bombay, (1955) 1 SCR 613 : AIR 1955 SC
123 : 1955 Cri LJ 215, clarified
In addition, there is no fetter on exercise of discretion of the Supreme Court in
referring questions of law to a larger Bench in the review petition. No matter is
beyond the jurisdiction of a superior court of record unless it is expressly shown to
be so, under the provisions of the Constitution. In the absence of any express
provision in the Constitution, the Supreme Court being a superior court of record
has jurisdiction in every matter and if there is any doubt, the Court has power to
determine its jurisdiction. There is no bar on the exercise of jurisdiction for referring
questions of law in a pending review petition. Therefore, the reference cannot be
said to be vitiated for lack of jurisdiction. The Supreme Court has acted well within
its power in making the reference.

Halsbury's Laws of England, 4th Edn., Vol. 10, relied on
Furthermore, the reference can be supported by adverting to Article 142 of the
Constitution which enables the Supreme Court to make any order as is necessary
for doing complete justice in any cause or matter pending before it. The expression
"cause or matter" would include any proceeding pending in Court and it would cover
almost every kind of proceeding pending in the Supreme Court including civil or
criminal proceedings. As such, the expression "cause or matter" surely covers
review petitions without any doubt.
(Para 28)
affirmed
Order LV Rule 6 makes it clear that the inherent power of the Supreme Court to
make such orders as may be necessary for the ends of justice shall not be limited
by the Rules. The Supreme Court is not precluded from recalling or reviewing its
own order if it is satisfied that it is necessary to do so for the sake of justice.
Therefore, reference of questions of law can be made in any pending proceeding
before the Supreme Court, including the instant review proceedings, to meet the
ends of justice.
(Para 29)
affirmed and extended
The reference of questions of law pertaining to the scope of Articles 25 and 26
of the Constitution are of utmost importance requiring an authoritative
pronouncement by a larger Bench, especially in light of the view of the reference
Bench that there is a conflict between the Court's judgments in Shirur Mutt case
and Syed Hussain Ali case. Therefore, the submission that the Court should not
give speculative opinions or answer hypothetical questions has no substance, as the
reference was made to finally settle the legal position relating to reservations.
Therefore, the reference in this case cannot be said to be suffering from any
jurisdictional error.

The contention that pure questions of law cannot be referred to a larger Bench
as it is not possible for the Court to decide the reference without any facts of a
particular case before it, cannot be accepted. It is not necessary to refer to facts to
decide pure questions of law, especially those pertaining to the interpretation of the
provisions of the Constitution. In fact, reference of pure questions of law have been
answered by the Supreme Court earlier in determination of the scope of Articles 25
and 26 is of paramount importance. To adjudicate the reference, there is no
requirement to refer to any disputed facts by the Supreme Court.

The contention is that reference to a larger Bench in accordance with the proviso
to Article 145(3) can be made only in appeals and not in any other proceedings has
no substance since the proviso deals with a situation when reference has to be
made by a Bench of less than five Judges. The present reference is made by a
Bench of five Judges and, therefore, the proviso to Article 145(3) is not applicable.

The Order of the Court was delivered by
S.A. BOBDE, C.J.- Indian Young Lawyers Association filed Writ
Petition (Civil) No. 373 of 2006 challenging the validity of Rule 3(b) of
the Kerala Hindu Places of Public Worship (Authorisation of Entry)
Rules, 1965 (for short "the 1965 Rules"). A further direction to the
respondents therein to permit female devotees between the ages of 10
to 50 years to enter the Sabarimala Temple without any restrictions
was sought in the writ petition.
2. By an order dated 13-10-2017 a three-Judge Bench of this Court
referred the matter to a larger Bench for resolution of the questions
raised in the writ petition. The writ petition was placed before a
Constitution Bench
consisting of five Judges. By a majority of 4: 1, this Court allowed the
writ petition on 28-9-20182.
3. It was held by this Court in Indian Young Lawyers Assn.
(Sabarimala Temple-5 J.)2 that the devotees of Lord Ayyappa do not
constitute a separate religious denomination and therefore, cannot
claim the benefit of Article 26 of the Constitution of India. This Court
also concluded that exclusion of women between the ages of 10 to 50
years from entry into the temple is violative of Article 25 of the
Constitution of India. Further, Rule 3(b) of the Kerala Hindu Places of
Public Worship (Authorisation of Entry) Rules, 1965 was declared as
violative of Article 25(1) to the Constitution of India and ultra vires
Section 3 of the Kerala Hindu Places of Public Worship (Authorisation of
Entry) Act, 1965.
4. Several review petitions were filed which were listed along with
the fresh writ petitions in open court and heard together. Ranjan Gogoi,
C.J. and A.M. Khanwilkar and Indu Malhotra, JJ. were of the opinion3
that the scope of the freedom of religion guaranteed under Articles 25
and 26 of the Constitution needs an authoritative pronouncement by a
larger Bench of not less than seven Judges. The contours of judicial
review in matters pertaining to essential religious practices was another
issue which was identified to be adjudicated upon by a larger Bench.
According to them, the determination of the questions of law referred to
a larger Bench would have a bearing on pending writ petitions relating
to entry of Muslim women in durgahs/mosques, the entry of Parsi
women married to non-Parsis into the holy fireplace of Agyari and the
challenge to the practice of female genital mutilation in Dawoodi Bohra
community. In such view, certain questions of law were referred to a
larger Bench. According to the reference, the conflict of opinion
between the judgments in Commr. V. Sri Lakshmindra Thirtha Swamiar
of Sri Shirur Matt4 and Durgah Committee V. Syed Hussain Ali5
pertaining to the role of the Court in matters which are essential
religious practices had to be resolved.
5. The following issues were framed for consideration to be decided
by a larger Bench: [Kantaru Rajeevaru case (Sabarimala Temple Review
"5.1. (i) Regarding the interplay between the freedom of religion
under Articles 25 and 26 of the Constitution and other provisions in
Part III, particularly Article 14.
5.2. (ii) What is the sweep of expression "public order, morality
and health" occurring in Article 25(1) of the Constitution.
5.3. (iii) The expression "morality" or "constitutional morality" has
not been defined in the Constitution. Is it overarching morality in
reference to Preamble or limited to religious beliefs or faith. There is
need to delineate the contours of that expression, lest it becomes
subjective.
5.4. (iv) The extent to which the court can enquire into the issue
of a particular practice is an integral part of the religion or religious
practice of a particular religious denomination or should that be left
exclusively to be determined by the head of the section of the
religious group.
5.5. (v) What is the meaning of the expression "sections of
Hindus" appearing in Article 25(2)(b) of the Constitution.
5.6. (vi) Whether the "essential religious practices" of a religious
denomination, or even a section thereof are afforded constitutional
protection under Article 26.
5.7. (vii) What would be the permissible extent of judicial
recognition to PILs in matters calling into question religious practices
of a denomination or a section thereof at the instance of persons who
do not belong to such religious denomination?"
The review petitions were adjourned 3 till the determination of the
questions by a larger Bench.
6. R.F. Nariman and D.Y. Chandrachud, JJ. did not agree with the
majority opinion, and rendered their separate dissenting opinion. The
review petitions were dismissed by them as no ground for review was
made out. The fresh writ petitions filed under Article 32 of the
Constitution were also dismissed as not maintainable.
7. This Bench of nine Judges was constituted by the Chief Justice of
India to answer the reference. At the threshold, upon the objection
raised by the parties taking exception to the reference, an issue as to
whether this Court can refer questions of law to a larger Bench in a
review petition was framed. Their request to hear the issue regarding
the maintainability of the reference as a preliminary question was
acceded to. We have heard the learned counsel for both sides on the
maintainability of the reference.
8. By an order dated 10-2-20206, we answered the preliminary point
by holding that questions of law can be referred to a larger Bench in a
review petition. Reasons were to follow later. On the same day we had
also reframed6 the issues referred to this Bench as follows: [Kantaru
"2.1. (1) What is the scope and ambit of right to freedom of
religion under Article 25 of the Constitution of India?
2.2. (2) What is the interplay between the rights of persons under
Article 25 of the Constitution of India and rights of religious
denomination under Article 26 of the Constitution of India?
2.3. (3) Whether the rights of a religious denomination under
Article 26 of the Constitution of India are subject to other provisions
of Part III of the Constitution of India apart from public order,
morality and health?
2.4. (4) What is the scope and extent of the word "morality"
under Articles 25 and 26 of the Constitution of India and whether it
is meant to include constitutional morality?
2.5. (5) What is the scope and extent of judicial review with
regard to a religious practice as referred to in Article 25 of the
Constitution of India?
2.6. (6) What is the meaning of the expression "sections of
Hindus" occurring in Article 25(2)(b) of the Constitution of India?
2.7. (7) Whether a person not belonging to a religious
denomination or religious group can question a practice of that
religious denomination or religious group by filing a PIL?"
9. By this order, we are giving reasons to support the order dated 10
-2-20206 by which we held that this Court can refer questions of law to
a larger Bench in a review petition.
10. It was argued on behalf of those objecting to the reference that
the review petitions are not maintainable in view of the limitations in
Order XLVII of the Supreme Court Rules, 2013. As the review petitions
are liable to be dismissed, the reference is bad. Assuming that
reference to a larger Bench can be made in a review petition, it is
permissible only after the review is granted and not during the
pendency of a review petition. It was contended that hypothetical
questions should not be answered by this Court. Another submission
was to the effect that abstract questions of law without facts cannot be
the subject-matter of reference. The reference is vitiated as no reasons
were recorded justifying the prima facie view that there is a conflict of
opinion in the judgments in Shirur Mutt case4 and Durgah Committee
case Another submission was made that only appeals can be referred
5
to a larger Bench in accordance with the proviso to Article 145(3) of the
Constitution of India.
11. On the other hand, the learned counsel supporting the reference
submitted that there are no limits to the jurisdiction of this Court which
is a superior court of record. This Court can determine its own
jurisdiction for exercise of its inherent powers. This Court can make any
order which is necessary to do complete justice under Article 142 of the
Constitution of India. The power of this Court cannot be fettered by
Order XLVII of the Supreme Court Rules. In any event, according to the
learned counsel, there is no bar in the Supreme Court Rules preventing
this Court from making a reference in a review petition. It was
submitted that the review petitions emanate from a judgment in a writ
petition, filed in the form of a public interest litigation, to which the
rules of procedure do not strictly apply. It was urged that seminal
questions of utmost importance arise for consideration which require
authoritative pronouncement of a larger Bench. Therefore, the reference
has to be answered to meet the ends of justice.
12. Though the preliminary point for adjudication is the reference of
questions of law to a larger Bench in a review petition, submissions
were made by both sides regarding the maintainability of the review
petitions. Presumably, this was done because no reference can be made
in review petitions which were not maintainable. Admittedly, the review
petitions are kept pending awaiting the pronouncement on the
questions of law which were referred to this Bench. Therefore, we
refrain from expressing any view on the merits of the review petitions.
However, it is necessary for us to decide the maintainability of the
review petitions in view of the submissions made by the parties.
13. Article 137 of the Constitution of India empowers the Supreme
Court to review any judgment pronounced or order made by it subject
to the provisions of any law made by Parliament or any rules made
under Article 145. No law has been made by Parliament as
contemplated in Article 137. Article 145 of the Constitution of India
gives power to the Supreme Court to make rules for regulating the
practice and procedures in the Court. Article 145(1)(e) pertains to the
rules relating to the conditions subject to which any judgment or order
pronounced by the Court may be reviewed and the procedure for such
review including the time within which applications to the Court for
such review are to be entertained. The Supreme Court Rules which
were made in 1966 were repealed by the Supreme Court Rules, 2013,
which are in force.
14. Order XLVII Rule 1 of the Supreme Court Rules, 2013 reads as
follows:
"1. The Court may review its judgment or order, but no
application for review will be entertained in a civil proceeding except
on the ground mentioned in Order 47 Rule 1 of the Code, and in a
criminal proceeding except on the ground of an error apparent on the
The surest way't to legal research!
face of the record.
The application for review shall be accompanied by a certificate of
the Advocate-on-Record certifying that it is the first application for
review and is based on the grounds admissible under the Rules."
15. It is clear from a plain reading of Order XLVII Rule 1 that there
are no restrictions on the power of this Court to review its judgment or
order. The exceptions to the general power of review relate to review of
civil proceedings which can be entertained only on grounds mentioned
in Order 47 Rule 1 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 and to review of
criminal proceedings which can be entertained only on the ground of an
error apparent on the face of record. It is clear that there is no fetter in
the exercise of the jurisdiction of this Court in review petitions of
judgments or orders arising out of proceedings other than civil and
criminal proceedings.
16. Part II of the Supreme Court Rules deals with civil appeals,
criminal appeals and special leave petitions under Article 136 of the
Constitution. Order XXI refers to special leave petitions (civil) and
Order XXII covers special leave petitions (criminal) proceedings.
Petitions filed under Article 32 of the Constitution are dealt with under
Order XXXII in Part III of the Supreme Court Rules. Rule 12 of Order
XXXVIII refers to public interest litigation. Admittedly, Writ Petition
(Civil) No. 373 of 2006 was filed in public interest. The review petitions
arise out of the judgment in the said writ petition.
17. Civil proceedings and criminal proceedings dealt with in Part II
of the Rules are different from writ petitions covered by Part III of the
Supreme Court Rules. The exceptions carved out in Order XLVII Rule 1
of the Supreme Court Rules pertain only to civil and criminal
proceedings. Writ petitions filed under Article 32 of the Constitution of
India do not fall within the purview of civil and criminal proceedings.
Therefore, the limitations in Order XLVII Rule 1 do not apply to review
petitions filed against judgments or orders passed in writ petitions filed
under Article 32 of the Constitution of India.
18. When a statute is carefully punctuated and there is doubt about
its meaning, weight should undoubtedly be given to the punctuation.
[See: Crawford: Interpretation of Law (Statutory Construction).]
However, punctuation may have its uses in some cases, but it cannot
certainly be regarded as a controlling element and cannot be allowed to
control the plain meaning ¹. Clause 13(3)(v) of the C.P. and Berar
The surest way t to legal research!"
Letting of Premises and Rent Control Order, 1949 fell for interpretation
of this Court in M.K. Salpekar V. Sunil Kumar Shamsunder Chaudhari.
Clause 13(3)(v) reads:
"13. (3)(v) that the tenant has secured alternative
accommodation, or has left the area for a continuous period of four
months and does not reasonably need the house."
This Court was of the opinion that the punctuation mark "comma"
which appears in the sub-clause after "alternate accommodation" and
before the rest of the sentence indicates that the last part of the sub-
clause, namely, "and does not reasonably need the house" governs only
the second part of the sub-clause.
19. Yet another case where punctuation was relied upon for
construing a statutory provision is Mohd. Shabir V. State of
Maharashtra ², Section 27 of the Drugs and Cosmetics Act, 1940 reads
as under:
"27. Penalty for manufacture, sale, etc. of drugs in
contravention of this Chapter.-Whoever himself or by any other
person on his behalf manufactures for sale, sells, stocks or exhibits
for sale or distributes-
(a) any drug-
(i) deemed to be misbranded under clause (a), clause (b),
clause (c), clause (d), clause (f) or clause (g) of Section 17 or
adulterated under Section 17-B; or
(ii) without a valid licence as required under clause (c) of
Section 18,
shall be punishable with imprisonment for a term which shall not be less than one
year but which may extend to ten years and shall also be liable to fine:
Provided that the Court may, for any special reasons to be
recorded in writing, impose a sentence of imprisonment of less than
one year;"
20. It was held that the words used in Section 27, namely,
"manufacture for sale", "sells" have a comma after each clause but
there is no comma after the clause "stocks or exhibits for sale". The
absence of any comma after the words "stocks" clearly indicates that
the clause "stocks or exhibits for sale" is an indivisible whole.
21. Construction of Order XLVII Rule 1 of the Supreme Court Rules
should be made by giving due weight to the punctuation mark
"comma" after the words "the Court may review its judgment or order".
The intention of the rule-making authority is clear that the
abovementioned part is disjunctive from the rest of the rule. Moreover,
the words "but no application for review will be entertained in a civil
proceeding except on ground mentioned in Order 47 Rule 1 of the Code
and in a criminal proceeding except on the ground of an error apparent
on the face of record" are exceptions to the opening words of Order
XLVII Rule 1, namely, "the Court may review its judgment or order".
Therefore, there is no limitation for the exercise of power by this Court
in review petitions filed against judgments and orders in proceedings
other than civil proceeding or criminal proceedings.
22. Submissions were made regarding the maintainability of the
review petitions for not satisfying the requirement of Order 47 Rule 1
CPC. This argument is on the basis that the review petitions were filed
against a judgment in a civil proceeding. Several judgments were cited
in support of this contention. As we have held that the review petitions
have arisen from a judgment in a writ petition filed under Article 32 of
the Constitution of India to which the provisions of Order 47 Rule 1 CPC
are not applicable, it is not necessary to refer to those judgments.
23. The alternate submission was that a reference can be made only
after the grant of review and not in a pending review petition. Support
for the proposition was sought from a judgment of this Court in Behram
Khurshid Pesikaka V. State of Bombay10. It is true that reference in the
said case was made after grant of review. But that does not mean that
reference cannot be made in a pending review petition.
24. The provision in the Supreme Court Rules, 2013 pertaining to
reference to a larger Bench is Order VI Rule 2 which reads as:
"2. Where in the course of the hearing of any cause, appeal or
other proceedings, the Bench considers that the matter should be
dealt with by a larger Bench, it shall refer the matter to the Chief
Justice, who shall thereupon constitute such a Bench for the hearing
of it."
25. Reference to a larger Bench can be made in any cause or appeal
as well as in any "other proceeding". The term "proceeding" is a very
comprehensive term and generally speaking, means a prescribed
course of action for enforcing a legal right. It is a term giving the
widest freedom to a court of law so that it may do justice to the parties
in
the case¹¹. There cannot be any doubt that the pending review
petition falls within the purview of the expression "other
proceeding". The reference has been made in the course of pending
review petitions.
26. In addition, there is no fetter on the exercise of discretion of this
Court in referring questions of law to a larger Bench in review petitions.
Being a superior court of record, it is for this Court to consider whether
any matter falls within its jurisdiction or not. Unlike a court of limited
jurisdiction, the superior court of record is entitled to determine for
itself questions about its own jurisdiction12.
27. No matter is beyond the jurisdiction of a superior court of record
unless it is expressly shown to be so, under the provisions of the
Constitution. In the absence of any express provision in the
Constitution, this Court being a superior court of record has jurisdiction
in every matter and if there is any doubt, the Court has power to
determine its jurisdiction13. It is useful to reproduce from Halsbury's
Laws of England, 4th Edn., Vol. 10, Para 713, relied upon in the
aforementioned judgments, which states as follows:
"713.
Prima facie, no matter is deemed to be beyond the
jurisdiction of a superior court unless it is expressly shown to be so,
while nothing is within the jurisdiction of an inferior court unless it is
expressly shown on the face of the proceedings that the particular
matter is within the cognizance of the particular court."
Undoubtedly there is no bar on the exercise of jurisdiction for referring
questions of law in a pending review petition. Therefore, the reference
cannot be said to be vitiated for lack of jurisdiction. This Court has
acted well within its power in making the reference.
28. Furthermore, the reference can be supported by adverting to
Article 142 of the Constitution of India which enables this Court to
make any order as is necessary for doing complete justice in any cause
or matter pending before it. The expression "cause or matter" would
include any proceeding pending in Court and it would cover almost
every kind of proceeding pending in this Court including civil or criminal
proceedings14. As such, the expression "cause or matter" surely covers
review petitions without any doubt. Therefore, it is well within the
province of this Court to refer questions of law in pending review
petitions.
29. Order LV Rule 6 makes it crystal clear that the inherent power of
this Court to make such orders as may be necessary for the ends of
justice shall not be limited by the Rules. In S. Nagaraj V. State of
Karnataka¹5, it was observed that even when there was no statutory
provision and no rules were framed by the highest court indicating the
circumstances in which it could rectify its orders, the courts culled out
such power to avoid abuse of process or miscarriage of
justice. It was further held that this Court is not precluded from
recalling or reviewing its own order if it is satisfied that it is necessary
to do so for the sake of justice. The logical extension to the above is
that reference of questions of law can be made in any pending
proceeding before this Court, including the instant review proceedings,
to meet the ends of justice.
30. By placing reliance on a judgment of this Court in Central Bank
of India V. Workmen16, it was submitted that this Court should not give
speculative opinions or answer hypothetical questions. The reference of
questions of law pertaining to the scope of Articles 25 and 26 of the
Constitution of India are of utmost importance requiring an
authoritative pronouncement by a larger Bench, especially in light of
the view of the reference Bench that there is a conflict between the
Court's judgments in Shirur Mutt4 and Durgah Committee5
An
objection similar to the one in this case was taken in Indra Sawhney V.
Union of India¹7, , which was rejected on the ground that the reference in
that case was made to finally settle the legal position relating to
reservations. Therefore, the reference in this case cannot be said to be
suffering from any jurisdictional error.
31. Regarding the contention that pure questions of law cannot be
referred to a larger Bench, it was argued that it is not possible for the
Court to decide the reference without any facts of a particular case
before it. We do not agree. It is not necessary to refer to facts to decide
pure questions of law, especially those pertaining to the interpretation
of the provisions of the Constitution. In fact, reference of pure
questions of law have been answered by this Court earlier. One such
instance was when this Court was convinced that a larger Bench has to
discern the true scope and interpretation of Article 30(1) of the
Constitution of India. An eleven-Judge Bench was constituted for the
purpose and eleven questions of law were framed and answered in
T.M.A. Pai Foundation V. State of Karnataka¹8. Yet another case where
there was a reference of pure questions of law for the larger Bench
needs mention. Finding a conflict between the judgments of this Court
in M.P. Sharma V. Satish Chandra¹9 and Kharak Singh V. State of U.P. 20
a three-Judge Bench of this Court referred2- the matter to a larger
Bench of five-Judge Constitution Bench, which referred 22 the issue
relating to the existence of the fundamental right to privacy in Article
21 of the Constitution of India to a nine-Judge Bench. The question
whether there is a constitutionally protected right to privacy was
decided by a nine-Judge Bench of this Court in K.S. Puttaswamy
(Privacy-9 J.) V. Union of India²3 without reference to any facts. As
stated above, determination of the scope of Articles
25 and 26 is of paramount importance. To adjudicate the reference,
there is no requirement to refer to any disputed facts by this Court.
32. The point that remains to be considered is the submission
pertaining to the proviso to Article 145(3). Article 145 of the
Constitution of India empowers this Court to make Rules for regulating
the practice and procedure of the Court. Article 145(3) provides that
the minimum number of Judges to decide any case involving
substantial questions of law as to the interpretation of the Constitution
or for the purpose of hearing a reference under Article 143 shall be five.
The proviso to Article 145(3) is as follows:
"Provided that, where the Court hearing an appeal under any of
the provisions of this Chapter other than Article 132 consists of less
than five Judges and in the course of the hearing of the appeal the
Court is satisfied that the appeal involves a substantial question of
law as to the interpretation of this Constitution the determination of
which is necessary for the disposal of the appeal, such Court shall
refer the question for opinion to a Court constituted as required by
this clause for the purpose of deciding any case involving such a
question and shall on receipt of the opinion dispose of the appeal in
conformity with such opinion."
33. The contention is that reference to a larger Bench in accordance
with the proviso to Article 145(3) can be made only in appeals and not
in any other proceedings. However, the proviso deals with a situation
when reference has to be made by a Bench of less than five Judges.
The present reference is made by a Bench of five Judges and, therefore,
the proviso to Article 145(3) is not applicable.
34. For the aforementioned reasons, the instant review petitions and
the reference arising from the review petitions are maintainable.
