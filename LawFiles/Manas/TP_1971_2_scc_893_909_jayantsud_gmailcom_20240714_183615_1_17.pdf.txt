JAGANNATH v. AUTHORISED OFFICER, LAND REFORMS
893
This observation was made in relation to a case of transfer, but it applies
with greater force to the case of promotion. The result is that we hold that
the power of promotion of persons holding posts inferior to that of the district
judge being in the High Court, the power to confirm such promotions is also
in the High Court. We also hold that in so far as Rule 5(iv) is in conflict
with Article 235 of the Constitution, it must be held to be invalid.
16. On the basis of the last part of Article 235, an argument was
purported to be advanced that the power of the High Court as to promotions
was limited. In view of the plain words of the first part of this article, this
argument has no basis.
17.
In this Court, no other point was made in support of this appeal.
18. The appeal, therefore, fails and is dismissed, but in the circum-
stances of the case with no order as to costs.

Held:
(i) Apart from the question as to whether the fundamental rights originally
enshrined in the Constitution were subject to the amendatory process of
Article 368, it must now be held that Article 31-B and the Ninth Schedule
have cured the defect, if any, in the various Acts mentioned in the said
schedule as regards any unconstitutionality alleged on the ground of infringe-
ment of fundamental rights and by the express words of Article 31-B, such
curing of the defect took place with retrospective operation from the dates

[1971
on which the Acts were put on the statute book. These Acts even if void
or inoperative at the time when they were enacted by reason of infringement
of Article 13(2) of the Constitution, assumed full force and vigour from the
respective dates of their enactment after their inclusion in the Ninth
Schedule, read with Article 31-B of the Constitution. The States could not,
at any time cure any defect arising from the violation of the provisions of
Part III of the Constitution and therefore the objection that the Madras
Land Reforms (Fixation of Ceiling on Lands) Act, 1961, should have been
re-enacted by the Madras Legislature after the Seventeenth Constitutional
Amendment came into force, is without substance.
(Para 23)
(ii) Entry 18 in List II like any other entry in the three Lists only gives the outline
of the subject-matter of legislation and therefore the words in the entry are
to be" construed in their widest amplitude. The field of legislation covered
by the entry is not to be narrowed down in any way unless there is anything
in the entry itself which defines the limits thereof. Entry 18 is meant to
confer the widest powers on the State Legislature with regard to rights in or
over land and such rights are not to be measured by or limited to the rights
as between landlords and tenants or the collection of rents. The words
which follow the expression "rights in or over land" are merely by way of
illustration. The specification itself shows that the genus of the rights
mentioned is not the one which landlords have vis-a-vis their tenants or vice
versa. All kinds of legislation regarding transfers and alienations of agri-
cultural land which may affect the rights therein of landlords and tenants
are envisaged by the entry as also improvement of land and colonisation of
such land. If the State Government seeks to enforce a measure by which the
condition of barren or unproductive lands can be improved, it can do so
even if the measure curtails the rights of landlords and tenants over them.
If the State wants to enforce a measure of acquiring lands of people who
hold areas a certain ceiling limit so as to be able to distribute the same
among the landless and other persons, to give effect to the directive principles
in Article 39(b) and (c) of the Constitution, it is not possible to say that the
same would be outside the scope of Entry 18 in List II, read with Entry 42
in List III. Such a measure can aptly be described as a measure of agrarian
reform or land improvement in that persons who have only small holdings
and work on the lands themselves would be more likely to put in greater
efforts to make the land productive than those who hold large blocks of
land and are only interested in getting a return without much effort. The
measure does not transgress the limits of the legislative field because it serves
to remove the disparity in the ownership of land. Persons who lose the
ownership of lands in excess of the ceiling imposed are compensated for the
lands acquired by the State and distributed among others. Acquisition of
land would not directly be covered by Entry 18 but, read with Entry 42 in
List III the State has the competence to acquire surplus land so as to give
effect to the policy in Article 39 of the Constitution
(Para 29)
(iii) The Madras Land Reforms (Fixation of Ceiling on Land) Act, 1961, is
constitutional and valid.
(Para 34)
(iv) Although decisions of the American Supreme Court and the comments of well-
known commentators like Willoughby and Cooley have great persuasive
force, we need not interpret our Constitution by too much reliance on them.

Appeals dismissed.
The Jadgment of the Court was delivered by
Mitter, J.-In all the above matters there is a common attack on the
validity of the Madras Land Reforms (Fixation of Ceiling on Land) Act,
1961. The Act received the assent of the President on April 13, 1962,
and was published in the Official Gazette on May 2, 1962. It is styled
"An Act to provide for fixation of ceiling on agricultural land holdings and
for certain other matters connected therewith in the State of Madras".
The preamble to the Act shows that it was passed in furtherance of the
directive principles of State policy as embodied in Article 39 of the Consti-
tution and in particular, clauses (b) and (c) thereof, namely, that the ownership
and control of the material resources of the community were to be so distri-
buted as best to subserve the common good and that the operation of the
economic system did not result in the concentration of wealth and means
of production to the common detriment. The Act sought to achieve this
by acquiring agricultural land from persons owning large holdings of it and
distributing the same to the landless and other persons so as to reduce the
disparity in the ownership thereof. This was attempted to be brought about

SUPREME COURT CASES
[1971
by fixing a ceiling on the holdings of agricultural land holdings so as to
render the surplus available for distribution.
2. The scheme of the Act in a nut-shell is as follows : By Chapter II
of the Act containing Sections 5 to 18 provision is made for the fixation of
ceiling of land holdings, furnishing of return by persons holding land in excess
of the limits specified, preparation and publication of draft statements as regards
land in excess of the ceiling area, exclusion of certain land from calculation
of ceiling area and acquisition of surplus land after the publication of the
final statement as envisaged in the Chapter. In particular, Section 5 fixes
the ceiling on holdings of land of every person and every family. Section 7
provides that subject to the provisions of Chapter VIII no person shall be
entitled to hold land in excess of the ceiling area. Sections 8 to 16 provide
for submission of return, obtaining of particulars and determination of the
surplus land of a person. Section 18 provides for publication of notification
by the Government to the effect that the surplus land is required for a public
purpose.
3. Chapter III of the Act provides for ceiling on future acquisitions,
enquiries into the bona fides and validity of transfers between the date of the
commencement of the Act and the notification thereafter, and the effect
of certain future transfers. Chapter VI provides for determination of com-
pensation for land acquired by Government under the provisions of the Act.
Section 50-the opening section in Chapter VI-provides for payment
of compensation according to the rates specified in Schedule III to every
person whose right, title and interest is acquired by Government under
Chapter II. Section 55 provides for payment of compensation either in
cash or in bonds or partly in cash and partly in bonds. Chapter IX provides
for exemptions in certain cases from the provisions of the Act. Chap-
ter XIII provides for disposal of the land acquired by the Government under
the Act.
4. Section 3 is the definition section. Under clause (7) thereof
'ceiling' area means the extent of land which a person is entitled to hold
under Section 5. By clause (11) "the date of commencement of the Act"
was fixed as April 6, 1960, i. e., the date on which the Madras Land
Reforms (Fixation of Ceiling on Land) Bill, 1960, was published in the
Official Gazette. A 'family' for the purpose of the Act is given an artificial
definition in clause (14). It means in relation to any person, the wife or
husband as the case may be, of such person and his or her-
(i) minor sons and unmarried daughters, and
(ii) minor grandsons and unmarried grand-daughters in the male line,
whose father and mother are dead.
Under the Explanation to the clause "minor sons" and "minor grandsons"
are not to include sons or grandsons-
(i) between whom and the other members of the family, a partition
by means of a registered instrument has taken place; or
(ii) in respect of whose family properties a preliminary decree for
partition has been passed, before the commencement of the
Act. Under clause (19) "to hold land" means with its
grammatical variations and cognate expressions, to own land
as owner or to possess or enjoy land as possessory mortgagee
or as tenant or as intermediary or in one or more of those
capacities. Under clause (34) 'person' includes any trust,
this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company V. D.B.
company, family, firms, society or association of individuals,
whether incorporated or not. Under clause (45) "surplus
land" means the land held by a person in excess of the ceiling
area and declared to be surplus land under Section 12, 13
or 14.
5. The Act was challenged by writ petitions filed in this Court in 1963,
A.
P. Krishnaswamy Naidu V. State of Madras, on the ground that its provisions
violated Articles 14, 19 and 31 (2) of the Constitution. The first attack was
at Section 5 of the Act laying down the ceiling area and the second at
Section 50 of the Act, read with Schedule III thereof which provided for
compensation. It was urged that the Act was not protected under
Article 31-A of the Constitution relying on the judgment of this Court in
Karimbil Kunhikoman V. State of Kerala." This Court held that the definition
of 'family' in Section 3(14) was artificial and resulted in discrimination
between persons equally circumstanced thus violating Article 14. The Court
also held that the provisions contained in Section 50 of the Act, read with
Schedule III with respect to compensation were also discriminatory and these
two sections, viz., Sections 5 and 50, being the pivotal provisions of the Act
the whole Act had to be struck down as unconstitutional. The judgment was
rendered on March 9, 1964.
6. It appears that similar attacks had been made not only to the above
Madras Act but to several Acts of other States imposing ceilings on the
holding of land and attempting to effect similar agrarian reforms. To
shield these Acts against such attacks Parliament passed the Constitution
(Seventeenth Amendment) Act on June 20, 1964. The statement of objects
and reasons for the Act shows that inasmuch as:
"Several State Acts relating to land reform were struck down on
the ground that the provisions of those Acts were violative of Articles 14,
19 and 31 of the Constitution and that the protection of Article 31-A was
not available to them."
It was "proposed to amend the definition of 'estate' in Article 31-A of the
Constitution by including therein lands held under ryotwari settlement as
also other lands in respect of which provisions are normally made in land
reform enactments" and it was also "proposed to amend the Ninth Schedule
by including therein certain State enactments relating to land reform in order
to remove any uncertainty or doubt that may arise in regard to their validity".
Accordingly Parliament passed the Seventeenth Amendment Act effecting
change not only in Article 31-A of the Constitution by adding a proviso
after the existing proviso in clause (1) but also substituting a new sub-
clause (a) in clause (2) and including in the Ninth Schedule no less than
forty-four Acts of different States of which Item 46 was the Act struck down
by this Court.
7. The Seventeenth Amendment Act was itself challenged in the case
of Sajjan Singh V. State of Rajasthan. A number of writ petitions were filed
in this Court under Article 32 of the Constitution in the year 1966, Golaknath
V. Punjab,4 challenging not only the validity of the Constitution Seventeenth
Amendment Act of 1964, but also Constitution Fourth Amendment Act, 1955,

SUPREME COURT CASES
[1971
and Constitution First Amendment Act, 1951, in SQ far as they affected the
petitioners' fundamental rights. The first petition in that group of cases was
filed by a group of persons against an order made by the Financial Commis-
sioner, Punjab holding that an area of 418 standard acres was surplus in the
hands of the petitioners under the provisions of the Punjab Security of Land
Tenures Act X of 1953, read with Section 10-B thereof. Five learned Judges
of this Court held all the amendments to be valid, while four others concurred
in the judgment delivered by Subba Rao, C. J., holding that although the
above Amendment Acts abridged the scope of the fundamental rights thus
violating Article 13 of the Constitution they could not be struck down
because of the earlier decisions of this Court to the contrary. One
learned
Judge took the view that the fundamental rights were outside the amendatory
process if the amendments sought to abridge or take away any of those rights,
but the First, Fourth and Seventh Amendments being part of the Constitu-
tion, by acquiescence for a long time could not be challenged and they
contained authority for the Seventeenth Amendment. The judgments in
Golaknath's case (supra), were rendered on February 27, 1967.
8. In the meanwhile a large number of writ petitions were filed in the
Madras High Court in the years 1964 and 1965, challenging the validity
of the Madras Act of 1961, and the main attack on the Act was two-fold.
It was urged that the Act having been struck down as invalid by this Court
in Krishnaswami Naidu's case (supra), it was non est and was void ab initio
and Article 31-B could not validate it without a separate Validating Act
being passed by the Madras Legislature, and, secondly, the Act was in-
competent for want of legislative power of the State. The second attack
was levelled on a wide front before the Madras High Court, but before us
learned counsel did not go as far in his challenge to the legislative competence
of the State to pass the Act.
9. On the first point, learned counsel's contention may be summarised
as follows. He urged that this Court having declared the Ceiling Act of
1961, void under the provisions of Article 13 sub-clause (2) of the Constitution
we must proceed on the basis that the legislation was void ab initio inasmuch
as it did not lie within the power of the State to make any law which abridged
the rights conferred by Part III of the Constitution. In other words, it was
said that the measure was non est or still-born and any validating measure
could not instil life therein. It was argued that the effect of the Act being
struck down by this Court was as if it had been effaced from the statute
book and to make any such Act operative, it was necessary not only to give
it the protection against violation of fundamental rights as was sought to be
done by Article 31-B but to get the State of Madras to re-enact the provisions
thereof. Learned counsel drew our attention to several decisions of this
Court in support of his argument and we shall take note of them in the order
in which they were placed before us.
10. The first case referred to was Behram Khrushed Pesikaka V. The State
of Bombay.5 In this case the main question turned on the interpretation
of the Bombay Prohibition Act XXV of 1949 and the effect of striking down
some of the provisions therein by this Court in The State of Bombay and
Another V. F. V. Balsara. In Balsaru's case (supra) this Court had held that
the provisions of the Act including clause (b) of Section 13 in so far as they

this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company V. D.B.
affected the consumption or use of liquid medicinal and toilet preparations
containing alcohol were invalid and save the provisions expressly mentioned the
rest of the Act was valid. It was also held that the decision declaring some
of the provisions of the Act invalid did not affect the validity of the rest of the
Act. The effect of partial declaration of the invalidity of Section 3(b) had
to be considered by a Constitution Bench of this Court in Pesikaka's case
(supra). According to Mahajan, .J., who delivered the opinion of the
majority Judges (see p. 654)
"The constitutional invalidity of a part of Section 3(b) of the
Bombay Prohibition Act, having been declared by this Court, that part
of the section ceased to have any legal effect in judging cases of citizens
and had to be regarded as null and void in determining whether a citizen
was guilty of ar. offence."
His Lordship also observed that in India there was no scope for the applica-
tion of the American doctrine enunciated by Willoughby that the declaration
by a Court of unconstitutionality of a statute which was in conflict with the
affected the parties only and there was no judgment against the statute.
The American doctrine was held not to be applicable to India in view of
Article 141 of the Constitution under which the law declared by the Supreme
Court is to be binding on all courts within the territory of India. According
to his Lordship
once a law has been struck down as unconstitutional law
by a Court, no notice can be taken of that law by any Court, and in
every case an accused person need not start proving that the law is
unconstitutional."
It is however to be noted that Das, J. (as he then was) took a different view
and pointed out that the section i. e., Section 13, in its entirety was still
enforceable against all/non-citizens. He found himself unable to accept the
proposition put forward by Field, J. in Norton V. Shelby County,7 that a law
declared to be unconstitutional was to be treated as inoperative as though it
had never been passed. In particular he relied on the fact that the Bombay
Act was a pre-Constitution Act and was certainly valid before Novem-
ber 26, 1950.
11. In Saghir Ahmed V. The State of U. P. and Others,8 the second case
referred to, this Court had to consider the effect of the amendment of
Article 19(6) of the Constitution by the Constitution First Amendment Act of
1951, which enabled the State to carry on any trade or business either by
itself or through corporations owned and controlled by the State to the
exclusion of private citizens wholly or in part. It is to be noted that this
provision of Article 19(6) which was introduced by the amendment of the
Constitution in 1951, was not in existence when the U. P. Road Transport
Act (Act II of 1951), was passed and it was held that the amendment of the
Constitution which came later could not be invoked to validate an earlier
legislation which must be regarded as unconstitutional when it was passed.
In delivering the judgment of the Court, Mukherjea, J. remarked (see at
p. 728) :
"The amendment of the Constitution which came later, cannot
be invoked to validate an earlier legislation which must be regarded as
unconstitutional when it was passed."

SUPREME COURT CASES
[1971
Counsel relied particularly on the following passage from Cooley's Con-
stitutional Limitations (Vol. I, p. 384 note) quoted by Mukherjea, J.:
"a statute void for unconstitutionality is dead and cannot be
vitalised by a subsequent amendment of the Constitution removing the
constitutional objection but must be re-enacted."
12. Strong reliance was placed on certain observations of this Court in
Deep Chand V. The State of Uttar Pradesh and Others. In Deep Chand's case
(supra) the constitutionality of the U. P. Transport Service (Development)
Act, 1965, the validity of the scheme of nationalisation framed and the
notifications issued by the State Government thereunder were challenged.
Subba Rao, J. (as he then was) who spoke for the Judges constituting the
majority discussed in detail the distribution of legislative powers under the
Constitution and the effect of any statute offending Article 13. He posed
the question if Articles 245 and 13(2) define the ambit of the power to
legislate, what is the effect of a law made in excess of that power? According
to him the American Law gave a direct and definite answer to this question.
He quoted from Cooley in his "Constitutional Limitations" (Eighth Edition,
Vol. I) at p. 382 where the learned author said:
"When a statute is adjudged to be unconstitutional, it is as if it
had never been
And what is true of an Act void in toto is true
also as to any part of an Act which is found to be unconstitutional, and
which, consequently, is to be regarded as having never, at any time,
been possessed of any legal force.'
The learned Judge also quoted from Rottschaefer on Constitutional Law
at p. 34 :
"The legal status of a legislative provision in so far as its applica-
tion involves violation of constitutional provisions, must however be
determined in the light of the theory on which courts ignore it as law
in the decision of cases in which its application produces unconstitu-
tional results. That theory implies that the legislative provisions never
had legal force as applied to cases within that clause."
The learned Judge analysed the decisions of this Court in a number of cases
and summarised the result thereof in the following propositions (see at
p. 40) :
"(i) Whether the Constitution affirmatively confers power on the
Legislature to make law subject-wise or negatively prohibits it from
infringing any fundamental right, they represent only two aspects of
want of legislative power
(ii) the Constitution in express terms make the power of a Legisla-
ture to make laws in regard to the entries in the Lists of the Seventh
Schedule subject to the other provisions of the Constitution and thereby
circumscribes or reduces the said power by the limitations laid down in

(iv) the doctrine of eclipse can be invoked only in the case of a law
valid when made but a shadow is cast on it by supervening constitu-
tional inconsistency or supervening existing statutory inconsistency
when the shadow is removed, the impugned Act is freed from all
blemish or infirmity."
Applying the aforesaid principles to the case before the Court the learned
Judge held that the validity of the Act could not be tested on the basis of
the Constitution (Fourth Amendment) Act, 1955, but only on the terms of
the relevant articles as they existed prior to the amendment.
13. It must be noted that Das, C. J. with whom Sinha, J. concurred
did not think fit to embark upon the discussion of the question, namely,
whether the provisions of Part III of the Constitution enshrining the funda-
mental rights were mere checks or limitations on the legislative competency
conferred on Parliament and whether the doctrine of eclipse was applicable
only to pre-Constitution laws or those which fell under Article 13(2) of the
Constitution.
14. The Seventeenth Amendment Act, 1964, came up for considera-
tion in the case of Sajjan Singh V. State of Rajasthan (supra). Among the
points there canvassed in support of the petitions under Article 32 of the
Constitution was one based on the plea that the Seventeenth Amendment was
a legislative measure in respect of land and since Parliament had no right to
make a law in respect of a land, the Act was invalid and since the Act
purported to set aside decisions of court of competent jurisdiction it was
unconstitutional. Although the court upheld the validity of the amendment,
a doubt was expressed by Mudholkar, J. as to whether Parliament could
validate a State law dealing with land. According to the learned Judge
only that Legislature has power to validate a law which has a power to enact
the law.
15. On behalf of some of the respondents and the intervener, the
Attorney-General of India, it was argued that no re-enactment of the Act
was necessary. Our attention was drawn to the wide scope of Article 31-B
which sought to cure the defect, if any, in the Acts specified in the Ninth
Schedule on the ground that any such Act or any provision thereof was
inconsistent with or took away or abridged any of the rights conferred by any
provisions of Part III of the Constitution. The words of Article 31-B, it
was argued, made it amply clear that this was sought to be done not only
prospectively but retrospectively by the use of the words "None of the Acts
shall be deemed to be void or ever to have become void on the
ground of the inconsistency mentioned." The removal of the defect was to
have effect
"Notwithstanding any judgment, decree or order of any court or
tribunal to the contrary."
In other words, this meant that if the defect in any such Act had been the
subject-matter of any decision of a court of law and any provision of the Act
had been held to be void as being inconsistent with Part III of the Con-
stitution such judgment, decree or order was not to be operative on the
provisions of the Act. In effect, it was contended that the inclusion of an
Act in the Ninth Schedule to the Constitution read with Article 31-B
overrode and rectified all defects in the Act because of inconsistency of any
provision therein with any of the fundamental rights conferred by Part III

of the Constitution, as from the date of the commencement of the Constitu-
tion, no matter whether the defect had been pointed out in any judgment of
a court of law and the Act held to be void on that ground.
16. Counsel for the respondent and the interveners drew our attention
to the dicta of learned Judges of this Court in several decisions which accor-
ding to them fortified their contention. The first doctrine referred to by
the
learned Attorney-General was that State of Maharashtra V. Patilchand, 10 where
the judgment of a Bench of Seven Judges of this Court was delivered by our
present Chief Justice. The Act impugned there was the Maharashtra State
Agricultural Lands (Ceiling on Holdings) Act, 1961, as amended by Act 13
of 1962. The preamble to that Act is practically identical with that of the
Madras Act which is under consideration in this case. It was contended on
behalf of the appellants there that Article 31-B did not protect from challenge
on the ground of violation of fundamental rights the provisions of the Acts
amending Agricultural Lands (Ceiling on Holdings) Act, 1961, as originally
enacted and that the Seventeenth Amendment Act in spite of the decision in
Golaknath's case (supra) was invalid. Negativing these contentions it was
said (see at p. 719)
the High Court was right in holding that Article 31-B
does protect the impugned Act from challenge on the ground of violation
of fundamental rights. There is no doubt that Article 31-B should be
interpreted strictly. But even interpreting it strictly, the only require-
ment which is laid down by Article 31-B is that the Act should be
specified in the Ninth Schedule."
Section 28 of the Act which was the main target of attack and which the
High Court had originally found as violating Article 14 of the Constitution
was held to be protected under Article 31-B from the ground of attack based
on infringement of Article 14.
17. In Bhikaji Narain Dhakras and Others V. The State of Madhya Pradesh
and Another, 11 the petitioners who carried on their business as stage carriage
operators of Madhya Pradesh for a number of years challenged the validity
of the C. P. and Berar Motor Vehicles (Amendment) Act, 1947, which
amended the Motor Vehicles Act, 1939, and conferred extensive powers on
the Provincial Government including the power to create a monopoly of the
motor transport business in its favour to the exclusion of all motor transport
operators. In exercise of the powers conferred by the new Section 43(1) (iv)
a notification was issued on February 4, 1955, declaring the intention of the
State Government to take up certain routes. The petitioners contended
that with the commencement of the Constitution the Act became void under
the provisions of Article 13(1) and reliance was placed on the decision of
Shagir Ahmad V. The State of U.P. (supra). The contention put forward on
behalf of the respondents was that the Constitution (First Amendment) Act,
1951, and the Constitution (Fourth Amendment) Act, 1955, had the effect of
removing the inconsistency and the Amending Act III of 1948 became
operative again. It was argued on behalf of the petitioners that the
impugned Act being void under Article 13(1) was dead and could not be
revived by any subsequent amendment of the Constitution but had to be
re-enacted. This contention was turned down in the unanimous decision of
this Court. It was said that the Act
"did not become void independently of the existence of the rights

guaranteed by Part III. In other words, on and after the commence-
ment of the Constitution the existing law, as a result of its becoming
inconsistent with the provisions of Article 19(1)(g), read with clause (6)
as it then stood, could not be permitted to stand in the way of the
exercise of that fundamental right. Article 13(1) by reason of its
language cannot be read as having obliterated the entire portion of the
inconsistent law or having wiped it out altogether from the statute book.
Such law existed for all past transactions and for enforcement of right
and liabilities accrued before the date of the Constitution, as was held in
Keshavan Madhava Menon's case. 12"
It was also observed that the:
"American authorities can have no application to our Constitution.
All laws, existing or future, which are inconsistent with the provisions
of Part III of our Constitution are by the express provision of Arti-
cle 13, rendered void 'to the extent of such inconsistency'. Such
laws were not dead for all purposes
It is true that as the
amended clause (6) (of Article 19) was not made retrospective the
impugned Act could have no operation as against citizens between
January 26, 1950 and June 18, 1951 and no rights and obligations
could be founded on the provisions of the impugned Act during the
said period whereas the amended clause (2) by reason of its being
expressly made retrospective had effect even during that period. But
after the amendment of clause (6) the impugned Act immediately
became fully operative even against citizens."
18. In M. P. V. Sundararamier and Co. V. The State of Andhra Pradesh,
Venkatarama Aiyar, J. speaking for the majority of the Court discussed at
some length the different aspects of the unconstitutionality of a statute.
Speaking for the Court he said (at p. 1468)
"In a Federal Constitution where legislative powers are distributed
between different bodies, the competence of the Legislature to enact
a
particular law must depend upon whether the topic of that legislation has
been assigned by the Constitution Act to that Legislature. Thus, a law
of the State of an Entry in List I, Schedule VII of the Constitution
would be wholly incompetent and void. But the law may be on a topic
within its competence, as for example, an Entry in List II, but it might
infringe restrictions imposed by the Constitution on the character of the
law to be passed as for example, limitations enacted in Part III of the
Constitution. Here also, the law to the extent of the repugnancy will be
void. Thus, a legislation on a topic not within the competence of the
Legislature and a legislation within its competence but violative of consti-
tutional limitations have both the same reckoning in a court of law they
are both of them unenforceable. But does it follow from this that both
the laws are of the same quality and character, and stand on the same
footing for all purposes? This question has been the subject of considera-
tion in numerous decisions in the American Courts, and the preponder-
ance of authority is in favour of the view that while a law on a matter
not within the competence of the Legislature is a nullity, a law on a topic
within its competence but repugnant to the constitutional prohibitions is
only unenforceable. This distinction has a material bearing on the

present discussion. If a law is on a field not within the domain of the
Legislature, it is absolutely null and void, and a subsequent cession of
that field to the Legislature will not have the effect of breathing life into
what was a still-born piece of legislation and a fresh legislation on the
subject would be requisite. But if the law is in respect of a matter
assigned to the Legislature but its provisions disregard constitutional
prohibitions, though the law would be unenforceable by reason of those
prohibitions, when once they are removed, the law will become effective
without re-enactment."
19. The learned Judge drew support for this conclusion from Willough-
by on the Constitution of the United States, Vol. I, p. 11 and Cooley on
Constitutional Law at p. 201.
20. In The State of Uttar Pradesh and Others V. H. H. Maharaja Brijendra
Singh, 14 the respondent challenged the constitutionality of the U. P. Land
Acquisition (Rehabilitation of Refugees) Act, 1948 by way of a writ petition
to the High Court and though the Court dismissed the petition it held that
two provisos to Section 11 of the Act were invalid as they offended Sec-.
tion 299(2) of the Government of India Act. Subsequently the Constitution
(Fourth Amendment) Act, 1955 included the U. P. Act in the Ninth Sche-
dule as item 15. The State of U. P. contended that the inclusion of this Act
in the Ninth Schedule protected it under Article 31-B of the Constitution
from any challenge under Section 299(2) of the Government of India Act.
The Court turned down the argument on behalf of the respondent that the
amendment of the Constitution which came after the decision of the
Allahabad High Court could not validate the earlier legislation which, at the
time when it was passed was unconstitutional. Relying on the decision of
this Court in Saghir Ahmad V. The State of U. P. (supra) it was said that the
provisions of the Act have been "specifically saved from any attack on their
constitutionality as a consequence of Article 31-B, read with the Ninth Sche-
dule, the effect of which is that the Act cannot be deemed to be void or ever
to have become void on the ground of its being hit by the operation of the
Government of India Act."
21. It has to be noted that although in Golaknath's case (supra) five
learned Judges of this Court speaking through Subba Rao, C. J. were of the
view that the Constitution Seventeenth Amendment Act infringed Article 13
(2) of the Constitution, yet on the basis of the earlier decisions of this Court
the same was held to be valid. It was said that
"As the Constitution (Seventeenth Amendment) Act holds the field,
the validity of the two impugned Acts, namely, the Punjab Security
of
Land Tenures Act X of 1953 and the Mysore Land Reforms Act X of
1962, as amended by Act XIV of 1965 cannot be questioned on the
ground that they offended Article 13, 14 or 31 of the Constitution."
The learned Chief Justice also made it clear (see at p. 814) that the
"decision will not affect the validity of the Constitution (Seventeenth
Amendment) Act, 1964, or other amendments made to the Constitution
taking away or abridging the fundamental rights."
Wanchoo, J. (as he then was) speaking for himself and two other Judges
observed that a constitutional invalidity could not be cured by State

Legislatures in any way but could only be cured by Parliament by Constitu-
tional amendment.
22. In our view, although decisions of the American Supreme Court
and the comments of well known commentators like Willoughby and Cooley
have great persuasive force, we need not interpret our Constitution by too
much reliance on them. Nor is it necessary to scrutinise too closely the
decisions wherein views appear to have been expressed that a law which is void
under Article 13 (2) is to be treated as still-born. Equally unfruitful would
it be to consider the doctrine of eclipse.
23. Apart from the question as to whether fundamental rights originally
enshrined in the Constitution were subject to the amendatory process of
Article 368 it must now be held that Article 31-B and the Ninth Schedule
have cured the defect, if any, in the various Acts mentioned in the said
Schedule as regards any unconstitutionality alleged on the ground of infringe-
ment of fundamental rights, and by the express words of Article 31-B such
curing of the defect took place with retrospective operation from the dates on
which the Acts were put on the statute book. These Acts even if void or
inoperative at the time when they were enacted by reason of infringement of
Article 13(2) of the Constitution, assumed full force and vigour from the
respective dates of their enactment after their inclusion in the Ninth Schedule,
read with Article 31-B of the Constitution. The States could not, at any
time, cure any defect arising from the violation of the provisions of Part III
of the Constitution and therefore the objection that the Madras Ceilings Act
should have been re-enacted by the Madras Legislature after the Seven-
teenth Constitutional Amendment came into force cannot be accepted.
24. On the other point as to the competency of the State Legislature,
Mr. Vedantachari drew our attention in particular to the following provi-
sions in the Act:
"Section 5(1) (a) Subject to the provisions of Chapter VIII, the
ceiling area in the case of every person and, subject to the provisions of
sub-sections (4) and (5) of Chapter VIII, the ceiling area in the case
of every family consisting of not more than five members, shall be
30 standard acres.
(b) The ceiling area in the case of every family consisting of more
than five members shall, subject to the provisions of sub-sections (4) and
(5) of Chapter VIII, be 30 standard acres together with an additional
5 standard acres for every member of the family in excess of five.
(2) For the purposes of this section, all the lands held individually
by the members of a family or jointly by some or all of the members of
such family shall be deemed to be held by the family.
3(a) in calculating the extent of land held by a member of a family
or by an individual person, the share of the member of the family or of
the individual person in the land held by an undivided Hindu family,
a
Marumakkattayam tarward, an Aliyasanthana family or a Nambudiri
Illom shall be taken into account.
(b) In calculating the extent of land held by a family or by an
individual person, the share of the family or of the individual person in
the land held by a firm, a society or association of individuals (whether
incorporated or not) or by a company (other than a non-agricultural
company) shall be taken into account.

7. On and from the date of the commencement of this Act, no
person shall except as otherwise provided in this Act, but subject to the
provisions of Chapter VIII, be entitled to hold land in excess of the
ceiling area
Provided that in calculating the total extent of land held by any
person, any extent in excess of the ceiling area and not exceeding half
an acre in the case of wet land and one acre in the case of dry land shall,
irrespective of the assessment of such land, be excluded."
He also drew our attention to Section 8 which required every person who
held land in excess of 30 standard acres to furnish to the authorised officer a
return containing the particulars specified in Section 10 which directed the
authorised officer to prepare a draft statement in respect of each person
owning or deemed to have held land in excess of the ceiling area. He argued
that legislative measures of this type were not covered by Entry 18 in List II
which runs as follows:
"Land, that is to say, rights in or over land, land tenures, including
the relation of landlord and tenant, and the collection of rents; transfer
and alienation of agricultural land land improvement and agricultural
loans colonization."
Counsel urged that the State could not frame a law under which the holding
of two persons could be lumped up for working out the area which the said
persons could be permitted to hold. He contended that the property of two
individuals could not be treated together for the purpose of acquisition by the
State by resort to the fiction of "holding land" in Section (19) of the Act and
in any event Entry 18 of List II did not comprehend such a power. He
referred us to the American decision in Hoeper V. Tax Commission, 15 where it
was held that the husband could not, consistently with the due process and
equal protection clauses of the 14th Amendment, be taxed by a State on the
combined total of his and wife's incomes as shown by separate returns,
whether her income is her separate property and, by reason of the tax being
graduated, its amount exceeded the sum of the taxes which would have been
due had their separate incomes been separately assessed.
25. Counsel also referred us to the decision in Balaji V. Income Tax
Officer, 16 and the contention there put forward that Entry 54 in the Federal
Legislative List of the Government of India Act, 1935, did not confer on the
Legislature any power to tax (a) on the income of B and therefore sub-sec-
tion (3) of Section 16 of the Income-tax Act, 1922, was ultra vires the
Legislature.
26. It is necessary to note that this court left the question open as it
felt that the petition in this court under Article 32 of the Constitution could
be satisfactorily disposed of on a narrower basis although the Court approved
of the view expressed in Sardar Baldev Singh V. Commissioner of Income-tax, 17 that
Entry 54 should be read not only as authorising the imposition of a tax but
also as authorising an enactment which prevented the tax imposed being
evaded.

27. Counsel also referred to the case of Diamond Sugar Mills Ltd. and
Another V. The State of Uttar Pradesh and Another, 18 where it was held that the
premises of a factory was not a local area within the meaning of Entry 52 in
List II of the Seventh Schedule and a law relating to "taxes on the entry of
goods into a local area for comsumption, use or sale therein" did not authorise
the State to impose a cess on the entry of cane into the premises of a factory
for such use, consumption, etc.
28. The American decision is hardly in point and so far as the three
Indian cases are concerned, they turned on the scope of entries with which
we are not concerned in this case. We were also referred to the observations
of this Court in Kavalappara Kottaraihil Kochuni V. State of Madras, 19 that indivi-
dual proprietary rights were ordinarily to be respected unless a clear case is
made out for their restriction.
29. In our view, Entry 18 in List II like any other entry in the three
Lists only gives the outline of the subject-matter of legislation and therefore
the words in the entry are to be construed in their widest amplitude. The
field of legislation covered by the entry is not to be narrowed down in any
way unless there is anything in the entry itself which defines the limits thereof.
Entry 18 in our opinion is meant to confer the widest powers on the State
Legislature with regard to rights in or over land and such rights are not to be
measured by or limited to the rights as between landlords and tenants or the
collection of rents. The words which follow the expression "rights in or over
land" are merely by way of illustration. The specification itself shows that
the genus of the rights mentioned is not the one which landlords have vis-a-vis
their tenants or vice versa. All kinds of legislation regarding transfers and
alienations of agricultural land which may affect the rights therein of land-
lords and tenants are envisaged by the entry as also improvement of land and
colonisation of such land. If the State Government seeks to enforce a measure
by which the condition of barren or unproductive lands can be improved, it
can do so even if the measure curtails the rights of landlords and tenants over
them. If the State wants to enforce a measure of acquiring lands of people
who hold areas over a certain ceiling limit SO as to be able to distribute the
same among the landless and other persons, to give effect to the directive
principles in Article 39(b) and (c) of the Constitution, it is not possible to say
that the same would be outside the scope of Entry 18 in List II, read with
Entry 42 in List III. Such a measure can aptly be described as a measure
of agrarian reform or land improvement in that persons who have only small
holdings and work on the lands themselves would be more likely to put in
greater efforts to make the land productive than those who held large blocks
of land and are only interested in getting a return without much effort. The
measure does not transgress the limits of the legislative field because it serves
to remove the disparity in the ownership of land. Persons who lose the
ownership of lands in excess of the ceiling imposed are compensated for the
lands acquired by the State and distributed among others. Acquisition of
land would not directly be covered by Entry 18 but, read with Entry 42 in
List III the State has the competence to acquire surplus land so as to give
effect to the policy in Article 39 of the Constitution.
30. This is not the first occasion when a measure of such kind has been
18.

SUPREME COURT CASES
[1971
challenged before this Court. In Sri Ram Ram Narain Medhi V. The State of
Bombay, 20 challenge was made to the vires of the Bombay Tenancy and Agri-
cultural Lands (Amendment) Act, 1956, which was an Act further to amend
the Bombay Tenancy and Agricultural Lands Act, 1948. The preamble to
the Act showed that it was a measure for ensuring full and efficient use of land
for agricultural purposes rendered necessary on account of the neglect of a
landholder or disputes between a landholder and his tenants to the prejudice
of the cultivation of the landlord's estate. The attack on the Act was made
on the ground that it was beyond the ambit of Article 31-A of the Constitu-
tion and was therefore vulnerable as infringing the fundamental rights
enshrined in Articles 14, 19 and 31. It was contended on behalf of the State
that it was a piece of legislation for extinguishment or modification of rights in
relation to an estate within the definition of Article 31-A of the Constitution.
Referring to the principles laid down by the Federal Court in United Provinces
V. Atiga Begum, 21 and by this Court in Navinchandra Mafatlal V. The Commissioner
of Income-tax, Bombay City, 22 it was observed by this Court that in construing
the words in a constitutional enactment conferring legislative power, the most
liberal construction should be put upon words so that the same may have
effect in their widest amplitude. It was held that having regard to the above
principle of construction the impugned Act was covered by Entry 18 in
List II of the Seventh Schedule and was a legislation with reference to land
within the competence of the State Legislature.
31. In Atma Ram V. The State of Punjab and Others, 23 the petitioners
challenged the constitutional validity of the Punjab Security of Land Tenure
Act X of 1953 as amended by Act XI of 1955, providing for security of land
tenure and other incidental matters. The impugned Act limited the area
which might be held by a land owner for the purpose of self-cultivation and
thereby rendering some area surplus to be utilised for resettling ejected
tenants. Section 18 of the Act conferred upon the tenants the right to
purchase from the land-owners the lands held by them and thus themselves
become the land-owners on prices which would be below the market-value.
It was held by this Court that "right in or over land" and "land tenures"
occurring in Entry 18 in List II were sufficiently comprehensive to include
measures of land-tenure reforms, such as the impugned Act sought to achieve.
32. The validity of the/Assam Fixation of Ceiling on Land Holdings
Act I of 1957, came up for consideration in Sonapur Tea Co. Ltd. V. Mst.
Muzirunnessa. 24 Section 4 of the Act prescribed a ceiling on existing holdings
and Section 5 empowered the appropriate authorities to call for submission
of returns by persons holding lands in excess of the ceiling. Section 8
empowered the State Government to acquire such excess lands by publishing
in the official Gazette a notification to the effect that such lands were required
for public purpose, and such publication was to be conclusive evidence of the
notice of acquisition to the person or persons holding such lands. It was
contended on behalf of the appellants there that the pith and substance of the
Act and its main object was to acquire the property and dispose of it at a
profit. Rejecting this contention it was observed by this Court (see p. 731)
that:

is to abolish the intermediaries and leave the lands either with the tiller
or the cultivator."
It was also observed:
"The State is paying compensation to the persons dispossessed
under the principles prescribed by Section 12; amongst the persons
entitled to such compensation tenants are included, and when the State
proceeds to settle lands on tenants it expects them to pay a fair amount
of price for the land and puts a ceiling on this price and it shall never
exceed the amount of compensation payable in respect of the said land.
In our opinion this provision is very fair and reasonable and it would be
idle to attack it as a piece of colourable legislation."
33. Lastly, reference may be made to the case of State of Maharashtra V.
Patilchand (supra) which has been already noted. There the Maharashtra
State Agricultural Lands (Ceiling on Holdings) Act, 1961, as amended by Act
13 of 1962 was upheld on the ground that it was enacted for securing the dis-
tribution of agricultural land to subserve the common good by imposing a
ceiling and also ensuring that the persons to whom surplus lands had been
granted after the same had vested in the State Government should supply
sugarcane at fair prices. The impugned Act, apart from Section 28 already
referred to, was held to be covered by Entry 18 in List II and Section 28 was
held as within the ambit of Entry 35 of List II dealing with "works, lands
and buildings vested in or in the possession of the State".
34. In the result, we hold that as the attacks on the vires of the Madras
Ceilings Act fail, the appeals must be dismissed but without any costs. In
all cases where the Madras High Court did not think fit to deal with the
matters of the case as regards the application of the Madras Ceilings Act to
the particular facts of a case, it will be open to the appellants to canvass the
same before the appropriate forum.
